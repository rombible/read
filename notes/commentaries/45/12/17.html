A previous injunction touched on the same subject in the exhortation to bless the persecutors; but with that exception, all the preceding verses have dealt with duties owing to those with whom we stand in friendly relations. Such exhortations take no cognisance of the special circumstances of the primitive Christians as ‘lambs in the midst of wolves’; and a large tract of Christian duty would be undealt with, if we had not such directions for feelings and actions in the face of hate and hurt. The general precept in our text is expanded in a more complete form in the verses which follow the text, and we may postpone its consideration until we have to deal with them. It is one form of the application of the ‘love without hypocrisy’ which has been previously recommended. The second of these three precepts seems quite heterogeneous, but it may be noticed that the word for ‘evil’ in the former and that for ‘honourable,’ in these closely resemble each other in sound, and the connection of the two clauses may be partially owing to that verbal resemblance; whilst we may also discern a real link between the thoughts in the consideration that we owe even to our enemies the exhibition of a life which a prejudiced hostility will be forced to recognise as good. The third of these exhortations prescribes unmoved persistence in friendly regard to all men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Dealing then, in this sermon only, with the second and third of these precepts, and postponing the consideration of the first to the following discourse, we have here the counsel that<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Hostility is to be met with a holy and beautiful life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The Authorised Version inadequately translates the significant word in this exhortation by ‘honest.’ The Apostle is not simply enjoining honesty in our modern, narrow sense of the word, which limits it to the rendering to every man his own. It is a remarkable thing that ‘honest,’ like many other words expressing various types of goodness, has steadily narrowed in signification, and it is very characteristic of England that probity as to money and material goods should be its main meaning. Here the word is used in the full breadth of its ancient use, and is equivalent to that which is fair with the moral beauty of goodness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A Christian man then is bound to live a life which all men will acknowledge to be good. In that precept is implied the recognition of even bad men’s notions of morality as correct. The Gospel is not a new system of ethics, though in some points it brings old virtues into new prominence, and alters their perspective. It is further implied that the world’s standard of what Christians ought to be may be roughly taken as a true one. Christian men would learn a great deal about themselves, and might in many respects heighten their ideal, if they would try to satisfy the expectations of the most degraded among them as to what they ought to be. The worst of men has a rude sense of duty which tops the attainments of the best. Christian people ought to seek for the good opinion of those around them. They are not to take that opinion as the motive for their conduct, nor should they do good in order to be praised or admired for it; but they are to ‘adorn the doctrine,’ and to let their light shine that men seeing their good may be led to think more loftily of its source, and so to ‘glorify their Father which is in heaven.’ That is one way of preaching the Gospel. The world knows goodness when it sees it, though it often hates it, and has no better ground for its dislike of a man than that his purity and beauty of character make the lives of others seem base indeed. Bats feel the light to be light, though they flap against it, and the winnowing of their leathery wings and their blundering flight are witnesses to that against which they strike. Jesus had to say, ‘The world hateth Me because I testify of it that the deeds thereof are evil.’ That witness was the result of His being ‘the Light of the world’; and if His followers are illuminated from Him, they will have the same effect, and must be prepared for the same response. But none the less is it incumbent upon them to ‘take thought for things honourable in the sight of all men.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This duty involves the others of taking care that we have goodness to show, and that we do not make our goodness repulsive by our additions to it. There are good people who comfort themselves when men dislike them, or scoff at them, by thinking that their religion is the cause, when it is only their own roughness and harshness of character. It is not enough that we present an austere and repellent virtue; the fair food should be set on a fair platter. This duty is especially owing to our enemies. They are our keenest critics. They watch for our halting. The thought of their hostile scrutiny should ever stimulate us, and the consciousness that Argus-eyes are watching us, with a keenness sharpened by dislike, should lead us not only to vigilance over our own steps, but also to the prayer, ‘Lead me in a plain path, because of those who watch me.’ To ‘provide things honest in the sight of all men’ is a possible way of disarming some hostility, conciliating some prejudice, and commending to some hearts the Lord whom we seek to imitate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Be sure that, if there is to be enmity, it is all on one side.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>‘As much as in you lieth, be at peace with all.’ These words are, I think, unduly limited when they are supposed to imply that there are circumstances in which a Christian has a right to be at strife. As if they meant: Be peaceable as far as you can; but if it be impossible, then quarrel. The real meaning goes far deeper than that. ‘It takes two to make a quarrel,’ says the old proverb; it takes two to make peace also, does it not? We cannot determine whether our relations with men will be peaceful or no; we are only answerable for our part, and for that we are answerable. ‘As much as lieth in you’ is the explanation of ‘if it be possible.’ Your part is to be at peace; it is not your part up to a certain point and no further, but always, and in all circumstances, it is your part. It may not be possible to be at peace with all men; there may be some who <span class="ital">will</span> quarrel with you. You are not to blame for that, but their part and yours are separate, and your part is the same whatever they do. Be you at peace with all men whether they are at peace with you or not. Don’t you quarrel with them even if they will quarrel with you. That seems to me to be plainly the meaning of the words. It would be contrary to the tenor of the context and the teaching of the New Testament to suppose that here we had that favourite principle, ‘There is a point beyond which forbearance cannot go,’ where it becomes right to cherish hostile sentiments or to try to injure a man. If there be such a point, it is very remarkable that there is no attempt made in the New Testament to define it. The nearest approach to such definition is ‘till seventy times seven,’ the two perfect numbers multiplied into themselves. So I think that this injunction absolutely prescribes persistent, patient peacefulness, and absolutely proscribes our taking up the position of antagonism, and under no circumstances meeting hate with hate. It does not follow that there is never to be opposition. It may be necessary for the good of the opponent himself, and for the good of society, that he should be hindered in his actions of hostility, but there is never to be bitterness; and we must take care that none of the devil’s leaven mingles with our zeal against evil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is no need for enlarging on the enormous difficulty of carrying out such a commandment in our daily lives. We all know too well how hard it is; but we may reflect for a moment on the absolute necessity of obeying this precept to the full. For their own souls’ sakes Christian men are to avoid all bitterness, strife, and malice. Let us try to remember, and to bring to bear on our daily lives, the solemn things which Jesus said about God’s forgiveness being measured by our forgiveness. The faithful, even though imperfect, following of this exhortation would revolutionise our lives. Nothing that we can only win by fighting with our fellows is worth fighting for. Men will weary of antagonism which is met only by the imperturbable calm of a heart at peace with God, and seeking peace with all men. The hot fire of hatred dies down, like burning coals scattered on a glacier, when laid against the crystal coldness of a patient, peaceful spirit. Watch-dogs in farmhouses will bark half the night through because they hear another barking a mile off. It takes two to make a quarrel; let me be sure that I am never one of the two!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:17-21 Since men became enemies to God, they have been very ready to be enemies one to another. And those that embrace religion, must expect to meet with enemies in a world whose smiles seldom agree with Christ's. Recompense to no man evil for evil. That is a brutish recompence, befitting only animals, which are not conscious of any being above them, or of any existence hereafter. And not only do, but study and take care to do, that which is amiable and creditable, and recommends religion to all with whom you converse. Study the things that make for peace; if it be possible, without offending God and wounding conscience. Avenge not yourselves. This is a hard lesson to corrupt nature, therefore a remedy against it is added. Give place unto wrath. When a man's passion is up, and the stream is strong, let it pass off; lest it be made to rage the more against us. The line of our duty is clearly marked out, and if our enemies are not melted by persevering kindness, we are not to seek vengeance; they will be consumed by the fiery wrath of that God to whom vengeance belongeth. The last verse suggests what is not easily understood by the world; that in all strife and contention, those that revenge are conquered, and those that forgive are conquerors. Be not overcome of evil. Learn to defeat ill designs against you, either to change them, or to preserve your own peace. He that has this rule over his spirit, is better than the mighty. God's children may be asked whether it is not more sweet unto them than all earthly good, that God so enables them by his Spirit, thus to feel and act.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Recompense - Render, give, or return; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>. This is probably one of the most difficult precepts of Christianity; but the law of Christ on the subject is unyielding. It is a solemn demand made on all his followers, and it "must" be obeyed.<p>Provide - The word rendered "provide" means properly to "think" or "meditate beforehand." Make it a matter of "previous thought," of "settled plan," of "design." This direction would make it a matter of "principle" and fixed purpose to do what is right; and not to leave it to the fluctuations of feeling, or to the influence of excitement. The same direction is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>.<p>Things honest - Literally, things "beautiful," or "comely." The expression here does not refer to "property," or to "provision" made for a family, etc. The connection requires us to understand it respecting "conduct," and especially our conduct toward those who injure us. It requires us to evince a spirit, and to manifest a deportment in such cases, that shall be lovely and comely in the view of others; such as all people will approve and admire. And the apostle wisely cautions us to "provide" for this, that is, to think of it beforehand, to make it a matter of fixed principle and purpose, so that we shall not be overtaken and excited by passion. If left to the time when the offence shall be given, we may be excited and off our guard, and may therefore evince an improper temper. All persons who have ever been provoked by injury (and who has not been?) will see the profound wisdom of this caution to "discipline" and "guard" the temper by previous purpose, that we may not evince an improper spirit.<p>In the sight of all men - Such as all must approve; such that no man can blame; and, therefore, such as shall do no discredit to religion. This expression is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-4.htm">Proverbs 3:4</a>. The passage shows that people may be expected to approve a mild, kind, and patient temper in the reception of injuries; and facts show that this is the case. The Christian spirit is one that the world "must" approve, however little it is disposed to act on it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

Neither evil words for evil words, railing for railing; nor evil deeds for evil deeds, one ill turn for another; nor the evil of punishment for the evil of fault, unless it be by persons, who under God have an authority to inflict it; as the civil magistrate, who "is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil", <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; but private revenge is what is here forbidden: <p>providing things honest in the sight of all men. The Vulgate Latin reads, "not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of all men"; and the Alexandrian copy reads, "in the sight of God and in the sight of men", which clause seems to have crept in here, out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>. The words are not to be understood of a man's providing things honest, decent, and commendable, as suitable food and raiment for his family, in the sight of all men, to the honour of religion, and the credit of his profession, which is right to be done; but of a provident, thoughtful, and studious concern, to do everything that is laudable and of good report among men. The Syriac version renders the words alter this manner,    , "but be careful to do well", or exercise beneficence before all men; either restraining it to acts of beneficence, even to them that do us ill, in opposition to rendering evil to them; or applying it to all offices of humanity, and every good work, which are to be done in the sight of men; not merely to be seen of them, and in a vainglorious way, in order to obtain their esteem and applause, as did the Pharisees; but to avoid offence; to put, to silence, by well doing, the ignorance of wicked men; and to shame them that falsely accuse the good conversation of the saints; and to recommend the Gospel and true religion, and win men over to it thereby, and give an occasion to them of glorifying God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Recompense to no man evil for evil.

The view, according to which <span class="greekheb">τῇ ὀργῇ</span> is referred to the <span class="ital">divine</span> wrath (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-9.htm" title="Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>)—as the absolute <span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις</span> is the <span class="ital">divine</span> favour and grace (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-9.htm" title="Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>)—is rightly preferred by most interpreters from the time of Chrysostom down to van Hengel, Hofmann, Delitzsch; for, on the one hand, it corresponds entirely to the profane (Gataker, <span class="ital">ad Anton</span>, p. 104; Wetstein <span class="ital">in loc</span>.) and Pauline (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-27.htm" title="Neither give place to the devil.">Ephesians 4:27</a>) use of <span class="greekheb">τόπον</span> (or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΏΡΑΝ</span></span></span>) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΔΌΝΑΙ</span></span></span>—which primarily denotes to <span class="ital">make place for any one</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-9.htm" title="And he that bade you and him come and say to you, Give this man place; and you begin with shame to take the lowest room.">Luke 14:9</a>), then to <span class="ital">give any one full play, time and opportunity for activity</span> (Eph. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, comp. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/13-21.htm" title="A rich man beginning to fall is held up of his friends: but a poor man being down is thrust away by his friends.">Sir 13:21</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/19-17.htm" title="Admonish thy neighbour before thou threaten him; and not being angry, give place to the law of the most High.">Sir 19:17</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/38-12.htm" title="Then give place to the physician, for the Lord hath created him: let him not go from thee, for thou hast need of him.">Sir 38:12</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/16-14.htm" title="Make way for every work of mercy: for every man shall find according to his works.">Sir 16:14</a>; Philo in Loesner, p. 263); and on the other hand it is most appropriate to the following scriptural proof. Non-compliance with the precept occasions the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΡΓΊΖΕΣΘΑΙ ΚΑῚ ἉΜΑΡΤΆΝΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-26.htm" title="Be you angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down on your wrath:">Ephesians 4:26</a>. Comp. on the thought <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1 Peter 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-13.htm" title="As said the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked: but my hand shall not be on you.">1 Samuel 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.">1 Samuel 24:16</a>. Others interpret it of <span class="ital">one’s own wrath</span>, <span class="ital">which is not to be allowed to break forth</span>. So de Dieu, Bos, Semler, Cramer, and Reiche: “Wrath produces terrible effects in the moment of its ebullition; give it time, and it passes away.” The <span class="ital">Latin</span> use of <span class="ital">irae spatium dare</span> agrees indeed with this interpretation, but not the <span class="ital">Greek</span> use of <span class="greekheb">τόπον διδόναι</span>—not even in the well-known expression in Plutarch (<span class="ital">de ira cohib</span>. p. 462) that we should not even in sport <span class="greekheb">διδόναι τόπον</span> to anger, <span class="ital">i.e. give it full play</span>, allow it free course. Since this “<span class="ital">giving way to wrath</span>” (justly repudiated by Plutarch as highly dangerous) cannot be enjoined by Paul, he must have meant by <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὀργῇ</span> the <span class="ital">divine</span> wrath. For the interpretation given by others of the wrath <span class="ital">of an enemy</span>, which one is to <span class="ital">give place to</span>, to go out of the way of (Schoettgen, Morus, Amnion), must be rejected, since this, although it may be linguistically justified (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-9.htm" title="And he that bade you and him come and say to you, Give this man place; and you begin with shame to take the lowest room.">Luke 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-36.htm" title="So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted to the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.">Jdg 20:36</a>), and may be compared with Soph. <span class="ital">Ant</span>. 718 (see Schneidewin <span class="ital">in loc</span>.) and with the Homeric <span class="greekheb">εἴκειν θυμῷ</span>, yet would yield a precept, which would be only a rule of prudence and not a command of Christian morals. This applies also in opposition to Ewald: <span class="ital">to allow</span> the wrath of the other <span class="ital">to expend itself</span>, which, as opposed to personal revenge, has no positive moral character (it is otherwise with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm" title="But I say to you, That you resist not evil: but whoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.">Matthew 5:39</a>); not to mention that the injury, the personal avenging of which is forbidden, by no means necessarily supposes a <span class="ital">wrathful</span> offender.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γέγρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-35.htm" title="To me belongs vengeance and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come on them make haste.">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, freely as regards the sense, from the Hebrew (<span class="ital">to me belongs revenge and requital</span>), but with use of the words of the LXX., which depart from the original (<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ἐκδικήσεως ἀνταποδώσω</span>), and with the addition of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΈΓΕΙ ΚΎΡΙΟς</span></span></span>. The form of this citation, quite similar to that here used, which is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm" title="For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.">Hebrews 10:30</a>, cannot be accidental, especially as the characteristic <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓῺ ἈΝΤΑΠΟΔ</span></span></span>. recurs also in the paraphrase of Onkelos (<span class="greekheb">וַאֲנָא אֲשַׁלֵּם</span>). But there are no traces elsewhere to make us assume that Paul made use of Onkelos; and just as little has the view any support elsewhere, that the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews followed the citation of Paul (Bleek, Delitzsch). Hence the only hypothesis which we can form without arbitrariness is, that the form of the saying as it is found in Paul and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm" title="For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.">Hebrews 10:30</a> had at that time acquired currency in the manner of a formula of warning which had become proverbial, and had influenced the rendering in the paraphrase of Onkelos. The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΈΓΕΙ ΚΎΡΙΟς</span></span></span> Paul has simply added, as was frequently done (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-11.htm" title="For it is written, As I live, said the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.">Romans 14:11</a>) with divine utterances; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm" title="For we know him that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, said the Lord.
