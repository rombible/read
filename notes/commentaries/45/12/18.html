So far as he is concerned, he is to do his best to maintain peace. The history of St. Paul himself, which is one of almost constant conflict, shows that this would not always be possible.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:17-21 Since men became enemies to God, they have been very ready to be enemies one to another. And those that embrace religion, must expect to meet with enemies in a world whose smiles seldom agree with Christ's. Recompense to no man evil for evil. That is a brutish recompence, befitting only animals, which are not conscious of any being above them, or of any existence hereafter. And not only do, but study and take care to do, that which is amiable and creditable, and recommends religion to all with whom you converse. Study the things that make for peace; if it be possible, without offending God and wounding conscience. Avenge not yourselves. This is a hard lesson to corrupt nature, therefore a remedy against it is added. Give place unto wrath. When a man's passion is up, and the stream is strong, let it pass off; lest it be made to rage the more against us. The line of our duty is clearly marked out, and if our enemies are not melted by persevering kindness, we are not to seek vengeance; they will be consumed by the fiery wrath of that God to whom vengeance belongeth. The last verse suggests what is not easily understood by the world; that in all strife and contention, those that revenge are conquered, and those that forgive are conquerors. Be not overcome of evil. Learn to defeat ill designs against you, either to change them, or to preserve your own peace. He that has this rule over his spirit, is better than the mighty. God's children may be asked whether it is not more sweet unto them than all earthly good, that God so enables them by his Spirit, thus to feel and act.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If it be possible - If it can be done. This expression implies that it could not always be done. Still it should be an object of desire; and we should endeavor to obtain it.<p>As much as lieth in you - This implies two things:<p>(1) We are to do our utmost endeavors to preserve peace, and to appease the anger and malice of others.<p>(2) we are not to "begin" or to "originate" a quarrel.<p>So far as "we" are concerned, we are to seek peace. But then it does not always depend on us. Others may oppose and persecute us; they will hate religion, and may slander, revile, and otherwise injure us; or they may commence an assault on our persons or property. For "their" assaults we are not answerable; but we are answerable for our conduct toward them; and on no occasion are we to commence a warfare with them. It may not be "possible" to prevent their injuring and opposing us; but it is possible not to begin a contention with them; and "when they" have commenced a strife, to seek peace, and to evince a Christian spirit. This command doubtless extends to everything connected with strife; and means that we are not to "provoke" them to controversy, or to prolong it when it is commenced; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-14.htm">Psalm 34:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39-41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>. If all Christians would follow this command, if they would never "provoke" to controversy, if they would injure no man by slander or by unfair dealing, if they would compel none to prosecute them in law by lack of punctuality in payment of debts or honesty in business, if they would do nothing to irritate, or to prolong a controversy when it is commenced, it would put an end to no small part of the strife that exists in the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto wrath</span>. The thought in ver. 19 seems to follow from what precedes. It may sometimes be impossible to he at peace with all; but at any rate, do not increase bitterness by avenging yourselves. <span class="accented">Give place unto wrath</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span>), has been taken by some to mean that we are to give scope to the wrath of <span class="accented">our enemy</span>, instead of being exasperated to resist it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>, etc.). But there has been no particular reference <span class="accented">to a wrathful</span> adversary. Another view is that our own wrath is intended, to which we are to allow time to expend itself before following its impulse; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> being taken as equivalent to <span class="accented">data spatium</span> in Latin (cf. Lactantius, 'De Ira,' 18, "Ego vero laudarem, si, cum fuisset iratus, <span class="accented">dedis-set irae suae spatium</span>, ut, residente per intervallum temporis animi tumore, haberet modum castigatio." Also Livy, 8:32, "Legati circumstantes sellam orabant, ut rem in posterum diem differret, et <span class="accented">irae suae spatium</span>, et consilio tempus <span class="accented">daret."</span> There seems, however, to be no known instance elsewhere of this use of the Greek phrase. Chrysostom, Augustine, Theodoret, and most commentators, understand the meaning to be that we are to <span class="accented">give place to</span> the <span class="accented">wrath of God</span>, not presuming to forestall it. <span class="accented">The wrath</span>, used absolutely, might be an understood expression for the Divine wrath against sin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>); and this interpretation suits the usual sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. It is not thus implied that the falling of Divine vengeance on our enemy should be our desire and purpose, but only this - that, if punishment <span class="accented">is</span> due, we must leave it to the righteous God to inflict it; it is not for us to do so. And this interpretation suits what immediately follows. <span class="cmt_word">For it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, quoted freely from the Hebrew, but with the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> as found in the LXX. The fact that the same form of quotation occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-30.htm">Hebrews 10:30</a> seems to show that it was one in current use). <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (so rather than <span class="accented">wherefore</span>, as in the Authorized Version) <span class="cmt_word">if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head</span>. This whole verse is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21, 22</a>, where is added, "and the Lord shall reward thee." What is meant by the "coals of fire," both in the original and in St. Paul's citation, has been much discussed. Undoubtedly, the expression in itself, in view of its usual significance in the Old Testament, suggests only the idea of Divine vengeance (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-10.htm">Psalm 140:10</a>; and especially 2 Esdras 16:53. Cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a>); and this especially as it occurs here almost immediately after "Vengeance is mine." Hence Chrysostom and other Fathers, as well as some moderns, have taken it to mean that by heaping benefits on our enemy we shall aggravate his guilt, and expose him to severer punishment from God. But it is surely incredible that the apostle should have meant to suggest such a motive for beneficence; and the whole tone of the context is against it, including that of ver. 21, which follows. Jerome saw this, writing," Carbones igitur congregabis super caput ejus, non in maledictum et condemnationem, ut <span class="accented">plerique existimant</span>, sed in correctionem et poenitudinem." But if the "coals of fire" mean the Divine judgment on our enemy, there is nothing to suggest a corrective purpose. The view, held by some, that the softening effect of fire on metals is intended, is hardly tenable. Heaping coals of fire on a person's head would be an unnatural way of denoting the softening of his heart. More likely is the view which retains the idea of coals of fire carrying with it, as elsewhere, that of punishment and the infliction of pain, but regards the pain as that of shame and compunction, which may induce penitence. This appears to be the most generally received view. It is, however, a question whether any such effect is definitely in the writer's view. He may mean simply this: Men in general desire vengeance on their enemies, expressed proverbially by heaping coals of fire on the head. Hast thou an enemy? Do him good. This is the only vengeance, the only coals of fire, allowed to a Christian. Then follows naturally, <span class="cmt_word">Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>If it be possible<p>Not if you can, but if others will allow.
