The truth was not to their taste. And we all know how soon a man will contrive, against the strongest evidence, to reason himself out of the belief of what he dislikes. But a man cannot be brought to greater slavery than to be given up to his own lusts. As the Gentiles did not like to keep God in their knowledge, they committed crimes wholly against reason and their own welfare. The nature of man, whether pagan or Christian, is still the same; and the charges of the apostle apply more or less to the state and character of men at all times, till they are brought to full submission to the faith of Christ, and renewed by Divine power. There never yet was a man, who had not reason to lament his strong corruptions, and his secret dislike to the will of God. Therefore this chapter is a call to self-examination, the end of which should be, a deep conviction of sin, and of the necessity of deliverance from a state of condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Being filled - That is, the things which he specifies were common or abounded among them. This is a strong phrase, denoting that these things were so often practiced as that it might be said they were full of them. We have a phrase like this still, when we say of one that he is full of mischief, etc.<p>Unrighteousness - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  adikia. This is a word denoting injustice, or iniquity in general. The particular specifications of the iniquity follow.<p>Fornication - This was a common and almost universal sin among the ancients, as it is among the moderns. The word denotes all illicit sexual intercourse. That this was a common crime among the ancient pagan, it would be easy to show, were it proper, even in relation to their wisest and most learned men. They who wish to see ample evidence of this charge may find it in Tholuck's "Nature and Moral Influence of Heathenism," in the Biblical Repository, vol. ii. p. 441-464.<p>Wickedness - The word used here denotes a desire of injuring others; or, as we should express it, malice. It is that depravity and obliquity of mind which strives to produce injury on others. (Calvin.)<p>Covetousness - Avarice, or the desire of obtaining what belongs to others. This vice is common in the world; but it would be particularly so where the other vices enumerated here abounded, and people were desirous of luxury, and the gratification of their senses. Rome was particularly desirous of the wealth of other nations, and hence, its extended wars, and the various evils of rapine and conquest.<p>Licentiousness - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  kakia. This word denotes evil in general; rather the act of doing wrong than the desire which was expressed before by the word "wickedness."<p>Full of envy - "Pain, uneasiness, mortification, or discontent, excited by another's prosperity, accompanied with some degree of hatred or malignity, and often with a desire or an effort to depreciate the person, and with pleasure in seeing him depressed" (Webster). This passion is so common still, that it is not necessary to attempt to prove that it was common among the ancients. It seems to be natural to the human heart. It is one of the most common manifestations of wickedness, and shows clearly the deep depravity of man. Benevolence rejoices at the happiness of others, and seeks to promote it. But envy exists almost everywhere, and in almost every human bosom:<p>"All human virtue, to its latest breath,<p>Finds envy never conquered but by death."<p>Pope.<p>Murder - "The taking of human life with premeditated malice by a person of a sane mind." This is necessary to constitute murder now, but the word used here denotes all manslaughter, or taking human life, except what occurs as the punishment of crime. It is scarcely necessary to show that this was common among the Gentiles. It has prevailed in all communities, but it was particularly prevalent in Rome. It is necessary only to refer the reader to the common events in the Roman history of assassinations, deaths by poison, and the destruction of slaves. But in a special manner the charge was properly alleged against them, on account of the inhuman contests of the gladiators in the amphitheaters. These were common at Rome, and constituted a favorite amusement with the people. Originally captives, slaves, and criminals were trained up for combat; but it afterward became common for even Roman citizens to engage in these bloody combats, and Nero at one show exhibited no less than four hundred senators and six hundred knights as gladiators.<p>The fondness for this bloody spectacle continued until the reign of Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, by whom they were abolished about six hundred years after the original institution. "Several hundred, perhaps several thousand, victims were annually slaughtered in the great cities of the empire." Gibbon's Decline and Fall, chapter xxx. 404 a.d. As an instance of what might occur in this inhuman spectacle, we may refer to what took place on such an occasion in the reign of Probus (281 a.d.). During his triumph, near 700 gladiators were reserved to shed each other's blood for the amusement of the Roman people. But "disdaining to shed their blood for the amusement of the populace, they killed their keepers, broke from their place of confinement, and filled the streets of Rome with blood and confusion." Gibbon's Decline and Fall, chapter 12. With such views and with such spectacles before them, it is not wonderful that murder was regarded as a matter of little consequence, and hence, this crime prevailed throughout the world.<p>Debate - Our word debate does not commonly imply evil. It denotes commonly discussion for elucidating truth; or for maintaining a proposition, as the debates in Parliament, etc. But the word in the original meant also contention, strife, altercation, connected with anger and heated zeal; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-11.htm">1 Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-9.htm">Titus 3:9</a>. This contention and strife would, of course, follow from malice and covetousness, etc.<p>Deceit - This denotes fraud, falsehood, etc. That this was common is also plain. The Cretans are testified by one of the Greek poets to have been always liars. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>. Juvenal charges the same thing on the Romans. (Sat. iii. 41.) "What," says he, "should I do at Rome? I cannot lie." Intimating that if he were there, it would follow, of course, that he would be expected to be false. The same thing is still true. Writers on India tell us that the word of a Hindu even under oath is not to be regarded; and the same thing occurs in most pagan countries.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28-31. gave them over&#8212;or "up" (see on [2182]Ro 1:24).<p>to do those things which are not convenient&#8212;in the old sense of that word, that is, "not becoming," "indecorous," "shameful."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Now follow the sins against the second table, which reigned amongst the Gentiles; amongst which <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">unrighteousness</span> is as the fountain, from whence the rest as streams do flow. This is the genus that comprehends all the evils hereafter enumerated. It is not to be supposed that all the following vices were found in every individual person; but the meaning is, that all were guilty of some, and some were guilty of all of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Fornication, wickedness; </span> in the Greek there is all elegant paronomasia, porneia, ponhria. So there are two more in the following verses, fyonou, fonou, asunetoi, asunyetoi. The design of the apostle is, to set down a particular vice; therefore, instead of <span class="ital">wickedness, </span> some read troublesomeness, or a desire to procure trouble and molestation to another. The devil is called oo ponhrov, the troublesome one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Maliciousness; </span> or, mischievousness, the better to distinguish it from envy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Malignity; </span> or, morosity and churlishness, taking all things in the worser part. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whisperers:</span> whisperers speak evil privily of others; backbiters, openly. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Being filled with all unrighteousness,.... From hence, to the end of the chapter, follows a large and black list and catalogue of the sad characters of the Gentiles, and of the best men they had among them; for the apostle is all along speaking, not of the common people, but of their wise professors, and moral instructors; than which there never was a more wicked set of men that ever lived upon the face of the earth; who under the guise of morality were guilty of the greatest pride and covetousness, and of the most filthy debaucheries imaginable: they were "filled with all unrighteousness". This word includes in it all manner of sin and wickedness in general; fitly expresses the condition of fallen men, destitute of a righteousness; designs every violation of the law respecting our neighbour; and is opposed to that vain conceit of righteousness which these men had: particular branches of it follow; as, <p>fornication; which sometimes includes adultery and an unchastity; simple fornication was not reckoned a sin among the Gentiles: <p>wickedness; or mischief, which intends not so much the internal wickedness of the heart, as that particular vice, by which a man is inclined and studies to do hurt, to others, as Satan does: <p>covetousness; this may intend every insatiable lust, and particularly the sin which goes by this name, and is the root of all evil, and was a reigning sin among the Gentiles. Seneca, the famous moralist, was notoriously guilty of this vice, being one of the greatest usurers that ever lived: <p>maliciousness; the word denotes either the iniquity of nature in which men are conceived and born; or that desire of revenge in men, for which some are very notorious: <p>envy; at the superior knowledge and learning, wealth and riches, happiness, and outward prosperity of others: <p>murder: which sometimes arose from envy, wherefore they are put together. There is an elegant "paranomasia" in the Greek text: <p>debate; strife about words more than things, and more for vain glory, and a desire of victory, than for truth: <p>deceit; through their empty notions of philosophy; hence "philosophy and vain deceit" go together, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>; making large pretences to morality, when they were the vilest of creatures: <p>malignity; moroseness; having no courteousness nor affability in them, guilty of very ill manners; as particularly they were who were of the sect of the Cynics. Now they are said to be "filled with", and "full of", these things; not filled by God, but by Satan and themselves; and it denotes the aboundings of wickedness in them, and which was insatiable. The apostle goes on to describe them, as <p>whisperers; who made mischief among friends, by privately suggesting, and secretly insinuating things into the mind of one to the prejudice of another. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-29.htm" title="Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,...">Romans 1:29-31</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πεπληρωμένους πάσῃ ἀδικίᾳ</span>] a more precise definition of <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν τὰ μὴ καθήκ</span>.: <span class="ital">as those who are full of every unrighteousness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>).

The construction of <span class="greekheb">καταλάλους</span> as an adjective with <span class="greekheb">ψιθυρ</span>.

Since no passage whatever supports the <span class="ital">active</span> signification, and since even Suidas and Oecumenius clearly betray that they knew the active meaning adopted by them to be a deviation from the usage of the ancient writers,[545] we must reject, with Koppe, Rückert, Fritzsche, de Wette, Philippi, Baumgarten-Crusius, and Hofmann, the interpretation, <span class="ital">Dei osores</span>, that has been preferred by the majority since the time of Theodoret.[546] Even the analogous forms that have been appealed to, <span class="greekheb">θεομισής</span>, <span class="greekheb">βροτοστυγής</span> (Aesch. <span class="ital">Choeph.</span> 51, <span class="ital">Prom.</span> 799), are to be taken as <span class="ital">passives</span>, and therefore testify against the active interpretation.[547] Comp <span class="greekheb">θεοβλαβής</span>, stricken of God, Herod. viii. 137, <span class="ital">al</span>[549] In particular, <span class="greekheb">θεομισής</span> is quite the same as <span class="greekheb">θεοστυγής</span>, the opposite of <span class="greekheb">θεοφιλής</span>, beloved of God. (See Plat. <span class="ital">Rep.</span> p. 612 E, <span class="ital">Euth.</span> p. 8 A; Dem. 1486, ult.; Arist. <span class="ital">Ran.</span> 443.)

The accentuation <span class="greekheb">θεοστύγης</span>, approved of even by Grotius and Beza, to distinguish it from the passive <span class="greekheb">θεοστυγης</span>, is nothing but an ancient (Suidas) unsupported fiction.

The adoption, nevertheless, of the active sense was occasioned by the consideration: “ut in passivo positum dicatur, nulla est ratio, quum P. hic homines ex vitiis evidentibus reos faciat,” Calvin; but even granting a certain unsuitableness in the passive sense, still we should not be justified in giving an explanation contrary to the <span class="ital">usus loquendi;</span> we should be obliged to abide by the view that Paul had mixed up a less suitable term among the others. But this objection is diminished, if we take <span class="greekheb">θεοστ</span>., in accordance with the idea of divine holiness, as a characteristic designation of <span class="ital">infamous evil-doers</span> in general. So Fritzsche, and also Philippi. Comp Plat. <span class="ital">Legg.</span> viii. p. 838 B: <span class="greekheb">θεομισῆ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">καὶ αἰσχρῶν αἴσχιστα</span>.

The distinction is expressed by covetousness and avarice. The one is the desire of getting, the other of keeping. Covetousness has a wider and deeper sense, as designating the sinful desire which goes out after things of time and sense of every form and kind. Hence it is defined by Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>) as idolatry, the worship of another object than God, and is so often associated with fleshly sins, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>. Lightfoot says: "Impurity and covetousness may be said to divide between them nearly the whole domain of selfishness and vice." Socrates quotes an anonymous author who compares the region of the desires in the wicked to a vessel full of holes, and says that, of all the souls in Hades, these uninitiated or leaky persons are the most miserable, and that they carry water to a vessel which is full of holes in a similarly holey colander. The colander is the soul of the ignorant (Plato, "Gorgias," 493). Compare, also, the description of covetousness and avarice by Chaucer, "Romaunt of the Rose," 183-246.<p>"Covetise<p>That eggeth folk in many a guise<p>To take and yeve (give) right nought again,<p>And great treasoures up to laine (lay).<p>.....<p>And that is she that maketh treachours,<p>And she maketh false pleadours.<p>.....<p>continued...</body></html>
