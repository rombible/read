They put aside the natural instinct of adoration, and fell to speculations, which only led them farther and farther from the truth. The new knowledge of which they went in quest proved to be fiction; the old knowledge that they had was obscured and lost by their folly. Starting with two things—a portion of enlightenment on the one hand, and the natural tendency of the human mind to error on the other, the latter prevailed, and the former became eclipsed.<p><span class= "bld">But became vain in their imaginations.</span>—They were frustrated—reached no good and sound result with their speculations.<p><span class= "bld">Their foolish heart.</span>—Not the same word as “fools,” in the next verse. <span class= "ital">Their unintelligent heart;</span> their heart which, by itself, was endowed with no special faculty of discernment such as to enable them to dispense with the enlightenment from above.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened....">Romans 1:21-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">“Because that when they knew God </span>— The writings of Plato, Xenophon, Plutarch, Cicero, and other philosophers, which still remain, together with the quotations made by Just. Martyr and Clem. Alexandrinus from those which are lost, prove that the learned heathen, though ignorant of the way of salvation, were not entirely unacquainted with the unity and spirituality of God, and had pretty just notions of his perfections, of the creation and government of the world, and of the duties which men owe to God and to one another. Their sin, therefore, in worshipping idols, and in concealing the true God from the vulgar, did not proceed so much from ignorance as from corruption of heart.” <span class="ital">They glorified him not as God </span>— Did not esteem him, pay homage to him, or worship and serve him in a manner worthy of him, and consistent with those apprehensions they had, or might have had, of him; <span class="ital">neither were thankful </span>— Grateful for his benefits. As the true God was not the object of the popular religion, no public thanksgivings were offered to him in any heathen country; and with respect to the private conduct of individuals, though there are still extant hymns in honour of the heathen gods, written by Orpheus, Homer, Pindar, and Horace, who were themselves philosophers as well as poets, we have never heard of any psalm or hymn composed by any heathen poet or philosopher in honour of the true God. It is observable, that thankfulness to God for his mercies, is here represented as a principal branch of religion, and undoubtedly no principle can be nobler, nor can any have a greater or more extensive influence. <span class="ital">But became vain in their imaginations </span>— Absurd, stupid, and ridiculous in their reasonings, concerning God’s nature and worship; entangling themselves with a thousand unprofitable subtleties, which only tended to alienate their minds more and more from every truly religious sentiment and disposition. <span class="ital">And their foolish, </span><span class="greekheb">ασυνετος</span>, their undiscerning, unintelligent, imprudent <span class="ital">heart was darkened </span>— Instead of being enlightened by these sophistries, it was more and more involved in ignorance and error, and rendered impenetrable to the simplicity of the most important truths. What a terrible instance have we of this in the writings of Lucretius! What <span class="ital">vain reasonings, </span>yet how <span class="ital">dark </span>a heart, amid pompous professions of wisdom! <span class="ital">Professing themselves to be wise </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">φασκοντες ειναι σοφοι</span>, <span class="ital">saying that they were wise; </span>“cum se dicerent, aut se dici sinerent sapientes:” <span class="ital">when they called, or suffered themselves to be called, wise men. </span>— Grotius. It evidently refers to their assuming the philosophic character, and to the pride they took in the title of <span class="ital">wise men, </span>or <span class="ital">lovers of wisdom. They became fools </span>— Degrading, in the lowest and most infamous manner, the reason which they so arrogantly pretended to improve, and almost to engross. Thus the apostle finely ridicules that ostentation of wisdom which the Greek philosophers made, by taking to themselves the name of <span class="ital">wise men. </span>And his irony was the more pungent, in that it was put into a writing addressed to the Romans, who were great admirers of the Greeks. <span class="ital">And changed, </span>&c. — As if he had said, As their folly and wickedness were evident in a variety of other vices, in which these heathen philosophers joined with the vulgar, so particularly in the early and almost universal prevalence of idolatry among them; for they <span class="ital">changed the glory </span>— The unutterable glory, <span class="ital">of the incorruptible </span>and immortal <span class="ital">God </span>— (the word <span class="greekheb">αφθαρτος </span>means both) all the majestic splendours, in which he shines forth through earth and heaven, <span class="ital">into an image, made </span>by their own hands, <span class="ital">like to corruptible </span>and mortal <span class="ital">man </span>— Which, how elegantly soever it might be formed, was an abominable and insufferable degradation of the infinitely perfect and eternal Godhead, had their folly proceeded no further. But, not content with this, they set up as emblems of Deity and objects of worship, brute creatures and their images: <span class="ital">birds, four-footed beasts, and creeping things </span>— Even such vile reptiles as beetles, and various kinds of serpents, which creep on the dust. The learned Egyptians in particular, as is well known, worshipped dogs, snakes, nay, and even vegetables. We may observe here, 1st, That the word corruptible, applied to man, signifies not only his being liable to dissolution, but to moral pollution; and the term <span class="ital">incorruptible, </span>applied to God, signifies that he is not liable to either. 2d, “The great evil of the heathen idolatry consisted in their setting up the images of men and beasts in their temples as representations of the Deity, by which the vulgar were led to believe that God was of the same <span class="ital">form, nature, </span>and <span class="ital">qualities </span>with the animals represented by these images. And the persons who thus changed the glory of God were not the common people among the Greeks, but the legislators, magistrates, priests, and philosophers; for they were the persons who framed the public religion in all the heathen countries; who established it by their laws, and recommended it by their example.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:18-25 The apostle begins to show that all mankind need the salvation of the gospel, because none could obtain the favour of God, or escape his wrath by their own works. For no man can plead that he has fulfilled all his obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly say that he has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness of man is described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table, and unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of that sinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less, do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, so that the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator's invisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he has made, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse. They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed the worship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, and senseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of true religion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospel prevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency of man's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or to govern the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainly show that men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries and superstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affections and most abominable deeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because that - The apostle here is showing that it was right to condemn people for their sins. To do this it was needful to show them that they had the knowledge of God, and the means of knowing what was right; and that the true source of their sins and idolatries was a corrupt and evil heart.<p>When they knew God - Greek, "knowing God." That is, they had an acquaintance with the existence and many of the perfections of one God. That many of the philosophers of Greece and Rome had a knowledge of one God, there can be no doubt. This was undoubtedly the case with Pythagoras, who had traveled extensively in Egypt, and even in Palestine; and also with Plato and his disciples. This point is clearly shown by Cudworth in his Intellectual System, and by Dr. Warburton in the Divine Legation of Moses. Yet the knowledge of this great truth was not communicated to the people. It was confined to the philosophers; and not improbably one design of the mysteries celebrated throughout Greece was to keep up the knowledge of the one true God. Gibbon has remarked that "the philosophers regarded all the popular superstitions as equally false: the common people as equally true; and the politicians as equally useful." This was probably a correct account of the prevalent feelings among the ancients. A single extract from "Cicero" (de Natura Deorum, lib. ii. c. 6) will show that they had the knowledge of one God. "There is something in the nature of things, which the mind of man, which reason, which human power cannot effect; and certainly what produces this must be better than man. What can this be called but "God?" Again (c. 2), "What can be so plain and manifest, when we look at heaven, and contemplate heavenly things, as that there is some divinity of most excellent mind, by which these things are governed?"<p>They glorified him not as God - They did not "honor" him as God. This was the true source of their abominations. To glorify him "as God" is to regard with proper reverence all his perfections and laws; to venerate his name, his power, his holiness, and presence, etc. As they were not inclined to do this, so they were given over to their own vain and wicked desires. Sinners are not willing to give honor to God, as God. They are not pleased with his perfections; and therefore the mind becomes fixed on other objects, and the heart gives free indulgence to its own sinful desires. A willingness to honor God as God - to reverence, love, and obey him, would effectually restrain people from sin.<p>Neither were thankful - The obligation to be "thankful" to God for his mercies, for the goodness which we experience, is plain and obvious. Thus, we judge of favors received of our fellow-men. the apostle here clearly regards this unwillingness to render gratitude to God for his mercies as one of the causes of their subsequent corruption and idolatry. The reasons of this are the following.<p>(1) the effect of ingratitude is to render the heart hard and insensible.<p>(2) people seek to forget the Being to whom they are unwilling to exercise gratitude.<p>(3) to do this, they fix their affections on other things; and hence, the pagan expressed their gratitude not to God, but to the sun, and moon, and stars, etc., the mediums by which God bestows his favors upon people. And we may here learn that an unwillingness to thank God for his mercies is one of the most certain causes of alienation and hardness of heart.<p>But became vain - To "become vain," with us, means to be elated, or to be self-conceited, or to seek praise from others. The meaning here seems to be, they became foolish, frivolous in their thoughts and reasonings. They acted foolishly; they employed themselves in useless and frivolous questions, the effect of which was to lead the mind further and further from the truth respecting God.<p>Imaginations - This word means properly "thoughts," then "reasonings," and also "disputations." Perhaps our word, "speculations," would convey its meaning here. It implies that they were unwilling to honor God, and being unwilling to honor him, they commenced those speculations which resulted in all their vain and foolish opinions about idols, and the various rites of idolatrous worship. Many of the speculations and inquiries of the ancients were among the most vain and senseless which the mind can conceive.<p>And their foolish heart - The word "heart" is not infrequently used to denote the mind, or the understanding. We apply it to denote the affections. But such was not its common use, among the Hebrews. We speak of the head when we refer to the understanding, but this was not the case with the Hebrews. They spoke of the heart in this manner, and in this sense it is clearly used in this place; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm">2 Peter 1:19</a>.

This hath chief respect to the conception and opinions that the heathen framed to themselves of the Divine Being. For though some denied there was a God, and others doubted thereof, yet generally it was acknowledged by them; yea, some owned a multiplicity of gods, and those either corporeal or incorporeal. Others acknowledged but one God, as Plato, Aristotle, &c.; but then they either denied his providence, as the Peripatetics, or tied him to second or inferior causes, as the Stoics.

Nature shows us that God is to be glorified and thanked, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, nature reveals Him to be great and good. But men were not content to accept the impression made on them by nature; they fell to reasoning upon it, and in their reasonings (<span class="greekheb">διαλογισμοί</span>, “perverse self-willed reasonings or speculations,” S. and H.) were made vain (<span class="greekheb">ἐματαιώθησαν</span>); the result stultified the process; their instinctive perception of God became confused and uncertain; their unintelligent heart, the seat of the moral consciousness, was darkened. In asserting their wisdom they became fools, and showed it conspicuously in their idolatries. They resigned the glory of the incorruptible God (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the incorruptible God, all glorious as He was, and as He was seen in nature to be), and took instead of Him some image of a corruptible, even of a vile creature. The expression <span class="greekheb">ἤλλαξαν τὴν δόξαν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is borrowed in part from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-20.htm" title="The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.">Psalm 105:20</a> (LXX): <span class="greekheb">ἠλλάξαντο τὴν δόξαν αὐτῶν ἐν ὁμοιώματι μόσχου ἔσθοντος χόρτον</span>. The reduplication of the same idea in <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὁμοιώματι εἰκόνος</span> shows the indignant contempt with which the Apostle looked on this empty and abject religion in which God had been lost. The birds, quadrupeds and reptiles could all be illustrated from Egypt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24</a> the Apostle turns from this sin to its punishment. Because of it (<span class="greekheb">διὸ</span>) God gave them up. To lose God is to lose everything: to lose the connection with Him involved in constantly glorifying and giving Him thanks, is to sink into an abyss of darkness, intellectual and moral. It is to become fitted for wrath at last, under the pressure of wrath all the time. Such, in idea, is the history of humanity to Paul, as interpreted by its issue in the moral condition of the pagan world when he wrote. Exceptions are allowed for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-10.htm" title="But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:">Romans 2:10</a>), but this is the position as a whole. <span class="greekheb">παρέδωκεν</span> in all three places (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm" title="Why God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves:">Romans 1:24</a>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀκαθαρσίαν</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-26.htm" title="For this cause God gave them up to vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:">Romans 1:26</a>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς πάθη ἀτιμίας</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm" title="And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;">Romans 1:28</a>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀδόκιμον νοῦν</span>) expresses the judicial action of God. The sensual impurity of religions in which the incorruptible God had been resigned for the image of an animal, that could not but creep into the imagination of the worshippers and debase it, was a Divine judgment. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἀτιμάζεσθαι τὰ σώματα αὐτῶν ἐν αὐτοῖς</span>, in accordance with the conception of a judicial act, expresses the Divine purpose—that their bodies might be dishonoured among them. For gen of purpose, see Winer, 408 ff.

In this passage all that is necessary to understand is the certainty (however learnt) of the existence of a Personal Omnipotent Creator.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful</span>] The verbs throughout this passage are aorists. The <span class="ital">process</span> of declension from the truth is not dwelt upon, so much as the <span class="ital">fact</span> that it did take place, at whatever rate. There was a time when man, although knowledge of God had been given him, ceased to praise Him and to thank Him for His “great glory” and His rich gifts; turning the praise and thanks towards idol-objects instead. We must note that these first marks of decline (failure to praise and to thank Him), indicate a subtle and lasting secret of idolatry. Man, conscious of guilt before the Eternal, shrinks from <span class="ital">direct</span> worship. In mistaken reverence, it may be, he turns away to “the Creature,” to address his praises there. But the result is inevitable; the God unworshipped rapidly becomes unknown.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but became vain in their imaginations</span>] “<span class="ital">Vain</span>,” here, as often in Scripture, is “<span class="ital">wrong</span>,” morally as well as mentally. “<span class="ital">Imaginations</span>” is rather <span class="bld">thinkings</span>: the Gr. is a word often rendered “thoughts,” (as e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm" title="For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:">Matthew 15:19</a>.) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-14.htm" title="Do all things without murmurings and disputings:">Php 2:14</a> it is rendered “disputings;” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm" title="I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.">1 Timothy 2:8</a>, “doubting.” The verb is used in e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-17.htm" title="And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?">Luke 12:17</a>, for the balancing of thing against thing in the mind. Both verb and noun, when the context gives them an unfavourable reference, indicate a habit of captious and hesitating thought such as would ignore plain testimony and attend to abstract difficulties by preference. Thus here, man, growing unused to adoration of his God, fell to independent thinking, (in however rude a form,) and “<span class="ital">in</span>” this, occupied in this, “<span class="ital">became vain</span>,” went astray altogether.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">their foolish heart</span>] “<span class="ital">Foolish</span>,” more strictly <span class="bld">unintelligent</span>; failing to see connexions and consequences. Same word as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-16.htm" title="And Jesus said, Are you also yet without understanding?">Matthew 15:16</a>.
