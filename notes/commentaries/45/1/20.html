Of these “power” is the most obvious. St. Paul does not go into the questions that have been raised in recent times as to the other qualities which are to be inferred as existing in the Author of nature; but he sums them up under a name that might be used as well by a Pagan philosopher as by a Christian—the attributes included in the one term “Godhead.” <span class= "ital">Divinity</span> would be, perhaps, a more correct translation of the expression.

For no man can plead that he has fulfilled all his obligations to God and to his neighbour; nor can any truly say that he has fully acted up to the light afforded him. The sinfulness of man is described as ungodliness against the laws of the first table, and unrighteousness against those of the second. The cause of that sinfulness is holding the truth in unrighteousness. All, more or less, do what they know to be wrong, and omit what they know to be right, so that the plea of ignorance cannot be allowed from any. Our Creator's invisible power and Godhead are so clearly shown in the works he has made, that even idolaters and wicked Gentiles are left without excuse. They foolishly followed idolatry; and rational creatures changed the worship of the glorious Creator, for that of brutes, reptiles, and senseless images. They wandered from God, till all traces of true religion must have been lost, had not the revelation of the gospel prevented it. For whatever may be pretended, as to the sufficiency of man's reason to discover Divine truth and moral obligation, or to govern the practice aright, facts cannot be denied. And these plainly show that men have dishonoured God by the most absurd idolatries and superstitions; and have degraded themselves by the vilest affections and most abominable deeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the invisible things of him - The expression "his invisible things" refers to those things which cannot be perceived by the senses. It does not imply that there are any things pertaining to the divine character which may be seen by the eye; but that there are things which may be known of him, though not discoverable by the eye. We judge of the objects around us by the senses, the sight, the touch, the ear, etc. Paul affirms, that though we cannot judge thus of God, yet there is a way by which we may come to the knowledge of him. What he means by the invisible things of God he specifies at the close of the verse, "his eternal power and Godhead." The affirmation extends only to that; and the argument implies that that was enough to leave them without any excuse for their sins.<p>From the creation of the world - The word "creation" may either mean the "act" of creating, or more commonly it means "the thing created," the world, the universe. In this sense it is commonly used in the New Testament; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-19.htm">Mark 13:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>. The word "from" may mean "since," or it may denote "by means of." And the expression here may denote that, as an historical fact, God "has been" "known" since the act of creation; or it may denote that he is known "by means of" the material universe which he has formed. The latter is doubtless the true meaning. For,<p>(1) This is the common meaning of the word "creation;" and,<p>(2) This accords with the design of the argument.<p>It is not to state an historical fact, but to show that they had the means of knowing their duty within their reach, and were without excuse. Those means were in the wisdom, power, and glory of the universe, by which they were surrounded.<p>Are clearly seen - Are made manifest; or may be perceived. The word used here does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament.<p>Being understood - His perfections may be investigated, and comprehended by means of his works. They are the evidences submitted to our intellects, by which we may arrive at the true knowledge of God.<p>Things that are made - By his works; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>. This means, not by the original "act" of creation, but by the continual operations of God in his Providence, by his doings, &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  poie&#772;masin, by what he is continually producing and accomplishing in the displays of his power and goodness in the heavens and the earth. What they were capable of understanding, he immediately adds, and shows that he did not intend to affirm that everything could be known of God by his works; but so much as to free them from excuse for their sins.<p>His eternal power - Here are two things implied.<p>(1) that the universe contains an exhibition of his power, or a display of that attribute which we call "omnipotence;" and,<p>(2) That this power has existed from eternity, and of course implies an eternal existence in God.<p>It does not mean that this power has been exerted or put forth from eternity, for the very idea of creation supposes that it had not, but that there is proof, in the works of creation, of power which must have existed from eternity, or have belonged to an eternal being. The proof of this was clear, even to the pagan, with their imperfect views of creation and of astronomy; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-14</a>. The majesty and grandeur of the heavens would strike their eye, and be full demonstration that they were the work of an infinitely great and glorious God. But to us, under the full blaze of modern science, with our knowledge of the magnitude, and distances, and revolutions of the heavenly bodies, the proof of this power is much more grand and impressive. We may apply the remark of the apostle to the present state of the science, and his language will cover all the ground, and the proof to human view is continually rising of the amazing power of God, by every new discovery in science, and especially in astronomy. Those who wish to see this object presented in a most impressive view, may find it done in Chalmer's Astronomical Discourses, and in Dick's Christian Philosopher. Equally clear is the proof that this power must have been eternal. If it had not always existed, it could in no way have been produced. But it is not to be supposed that it was always exerted, any more than it is that God now puts forth all the power that he can, or than that we constantly put forth all the power which we possess. God's power was called forth at the creation. He showed his omnipotence; and gave, by that one great act, eternal demonstration that he was almighty; and we may survey the proof of that, as clearly as if we had seen the operation of his hand there. The proof is not weakened because we do not see the process of creation constantly going on. It is rather augmented by the fact that he sustains all things, and controls continually the vast masses of matter in the material worlds.<p>Godhead - His deity; divinity; divine nature, or essence. The word is not used elsewhere in the New Testament. Its meaning cannot therefore be fixed by any parallel passages. It proves the truth that the supremacy, or supreme divinity of God, was exhibited in the works of creation, or that he was exalted above all creatures and things. It would not be proper, however, to press this word as implying that all that we know of God by revelation was known to the pagan; but that so much was known as to show his supremacy; his right to their homage; and of course the folly and wickedness of idolatry. This is all that the argument of the apostle demands, and, of course, on this principle the expression is to be interpreted.<p>So that they are without excuse - God has given them so clear evidence of his existence and claims, that they have no excuse for their idolatry, and for hindering the truth by their iniquity. It is implied here that in order that people should be responsible, they should have the means of knowledge; and that he does not judge them when their ignorance is involuntary, and the means of knowing the truth have not been communicated. But where people have these means within their reach, and will not avail themselves of them, all excuse is taken away. This was the case with the Gentile world. They had the means of knowing so much of God, as to show the folly of worshipping dumb idols; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-8.htm">Isaiah 44:8-10</a>. They had also traditions respecting his perfections; and they could not plead for their crimes and folly that they had no means of knowing him. If this was true of the pagan world then, how much more is it true of the world now?<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

It is just that position that makes <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΐΔΙΟς</span></span></span> the common property of both members (see especially Hartung, <span class="ital">l.c</span>[452] p. 116 f.), so that, in order to analyse the form of the conception, we may again supply <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀΐδιος αὐτοῦ</span> after <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ</span></span></span> (Stallbaum, <span class="ital">a</span>[453]<span class="ital"> Plat.

The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΕΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span> is the totality of that which God is as a Being possessed of divine attributes, as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΕῖΟΝ</span></span></span>, the collective sum of the divine realities.[455] This comprehensive sense must by no means be limited. The eternal <span class="ital">power</span>—this aspect of His <span class="greekheb">θειότης</span> which comes into prominence at first and before all others—and the <span class="ital">divinity</span> of God in its collective aspect, are rationally perceived and discerned by means of His works. Arbitrary is the view of Reiche, who holds that Paul means especially <span class="ital">wisdom and goodness</span>, which latter Schneckenburger conceives to be intended; and also that of Hofmann (comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-29.htm" title="For as much then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like to gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device.">Acts 17:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-4.htm" title="Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.">2 Peter 1:4</a>), that the <span class="ital">spiritual nature</span> of the divine being is denoted. We may add that Rückert holds the strange view, that <span class="greekheb">θειότης</span>, which could not properly be predicated of God, is only used here by Paul for want of another expression. It might be and was necessarily said of God, as being the only adequate comprehensive expression for the conception that was to be denoted thereby. For analogous references to the physico-theological knowledge of God, see Wetstein, and Spiess, <span class="ital">Logos spermaticos</span>, 1871, p. 212. The suggestion of Philo as the Apostle’s source (Schneckenburger) is out of the question. Observe further how completely, in our passage, the <span class="ital">transcendental</span> relation of God to the world—the negation of all identity of the two—lies at the foundation of the Apostle’s view. It does not exclude the <span class="ital">immanence</span> of God in the world, but it excludes all <span class="ital">pantheism</span>. See the passages from the O. T. discussed in Umbreit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναι αὐτοὺς ἀναπολ</span>.] has its logically correct reference to the immediately preceding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΓᾺΡ ἈΌΡΑΤΑ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ΘΕΙΌΤΗς</span></span></span>, and therefore the <span class="ital">parenthesis</span>, in which Griesbach and others have placed <span class="greekheb">τὰ γὰρ ἀόρ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">θειότης</span>, must be expunged. The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span></span></span> cannot be said of the <span class="ital">result</span>, as Luther, and many others, including Reiche, Köllner, de Wette, Rückert, Fritzsche, Reithmayr, Philippi, Ewald, following the Vulgate (<span class="ital">ita ut sint inexcusabiles</span>), have understood it; for the view, which takes it of the <span class="ital">purpose</span>, is not only required by the prevailing usage of <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> with the infinitive[456] (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>), but is also more appropriate to the connection, because the <span class="greekheb">καθορᾶται</span> is conceived as a result effected through God’s revelation of Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-19.htm" title="Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God has showed it to them.">Romans 1:19</a>), and consequently the idea of the divine purpose in <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[457] is not to be arbitrarily dismissed. Comp Erasmus (“ne quid haberent” etc.), Melancthon (“<span class="ital">propter quas causas</span> Deus” etc.), Beza, Calvin (“<span class="ital">in hoc ut</span>”), Bengel and others. But Chrysostom, even in his time, expressly opposes this view (comp also Oecumenius), and at a later period it became a subject of contention between the <span class="ital">Lutherans</span> and the <span class="ital">Reformed</span>, See Calovius. The view, which interprets it of the <span class="ital">result</span>, hesitates to admit the conception of a divine <span class="ital">decree</span>, under which Paul places the inexcusableness of men; and yet not only <span class="ital">may</span> this stand to the perception of God from His works which has existed since the beginning in the relation of <span class="ital">result</span>, but, in accordance with the thoroughly Scriptural idea of destiny (comp <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound.

Chrysostom among the ancients expressly opposed this view, saying, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>,<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x2e;</span> So that they should be may be suggested as an adequate rendering, so as to avoid the idea of God's manifestation of himself to men hating been from the first delusive, having condemnation, and not enlightenment, for its purpose. These two verses, 19 and 20, carry out the thought of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 18, their purport being to show that the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of men have been in spite of <span class="accented">knowledge</span>, and therefore involve them all in sin. For <span class="accented">sin</span> implies knowledge of good and evil; it is not imputed to the brute beasts, who but follow their natural instincts, having no perception of God or a Divine law. Now, to man, even without any special revelation, God manifests himself in two ways <span class="accented">- outwardly</span> in nature, and <span class="accented">inwardly</span> in conscience. In these verses the outward manifestation is spoken of, the other being more especially noted in ch. 2:14, etc. But here, too, an inward manifestation is implied by the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, as before by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. To the animals below us the phenomena of nature may be but a spectacle before their eyes, making no appeal to a mind within. But to man they have a language - they awake wonder, awe, admiration, a sense of infinite mysterious power, and, to the receptive of such impressions, of ideal beauty indefinable. To the psalmists of old they spoke irresistibly of God; of one infinite and eternal Being, above and beyond all; and their consciences, owning the supremacy of good in the moral sphere, concurred with their sense of the evidences of beneficence in nature, so as to convince them also of the <span class="accented">righteousness</span> of God. All men (the apostle would say) were originally endowed with a like capacity of knowing God; and their failure in this regard, shown in the various forms of idolatry prevalent throughout the world, he views as the first stage in the development of human sin. The next stage is general moral degradation, regarded as the judicial consequence of the dishonour done to God. It is, indeed, a necessary consequence; for low and unworthy conceptions of Deity bring with them moral deterioration; when man's Divine ideal becomes degraded, with it he becomes degraded too. Witness, for instance, the debauches and cruelties that so commonly accompanied idolatrous worship. Lastly, the final stage of this moral degradation is represented in an unveiled picture of the utter wickedness, and even unnatural vice, at that time prevalent and condoned in the heart of the boasted civilization of the heathen world. Such is the drift of the remainder of this first chapter. The argument suggests the following thoughts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> There is no mention here of Adam s transgression as the origin of human sin. The reason is that the apostle is arguing from a philosophical rather than a theological point of view, having Gentile as well as Jewish thinkers in his view as readers. His appeal in this chapter is not to the Old Testament at all, but to facts by all acknowledged. He is offering the world a philosophy of human history to account for the present perplexing state of things - for the undoubted discord between conscience and performance, between ideal and practice, - his purpose being to show universal guilt on the part of man. But his position here is quite consistent with what he says elsewhere (as in ch. 5.) of Adam's original transgression. For his whole argument in this chapter involves the doctrine of the <span class="accented">fall</span> of man, who is conceived to have been originally endowed with Divine instincts, and to have forfeited his prerogative through sin; and this is the essential meaning of the picture given us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. of the original transgression. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The entire drift of the chapter is against the view of the condemnation of mankind being due simply to the sin of the progenitor being <span class="accented">imputed to</span> the race. For all men are represented as guilty, in that all have sinned against light which they might have followed. This view does not, indeed, preclude that of an inherited infection of nature predisposing all to sin; nay, it rather necessitates it; for why should the sin have been so universal but for such predisposing cause? Still, the distinction between the two views is important in regard to our conception of the Divine justice. 3. It may, however, be said that the distinction is without a real difference in this regard; for that, if the inherited infection is such that sin becomes inevitable (as seems to be implied by its alleged universality), it may appear as inconsistent with the Divine justice to condemn men for it, as it would be to impute to them their progenitor's transgression. In reply to this difficulty, it may be said that Scripture nowhere says that men are <span class="accented">finally</span> condemned for it. On the contrary, the gospel reveals to us the atonement, preordained from the first, for the avoidance of such final condemnation; and this retrospective as well as prospective in its effects (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25, 26</a>), and as far-reaching as was the original transgression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-12.htm">Romans 4:12</a>, etc.). And our apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7, 14, 15, 16</a>) expressly asserts the salvation of <span class="accented">all</span> who, according to their light, have done what they could. The fact is, that in the argument before us (as in other passages of similar purport) it is only the <span class="accented">principle</span>, or the <span class="accented">ground</span>, of man's possible justification before God that is under review. The intention is to show that this cannot be man's own "works or deservings," as of debt, but is another which the gospel reveals. Be it observed, lastly, that a clear view of this position is important, not only for our apprehension of the truth of things and of the meaning of the gospel, but also for our right moral tone of mind and attitude before God. For not to be convinced of sin is to belie the true ideal of our conscience, and implies acquiescence in a moral standard below that of the Divine righteousness to which we are able to aspire. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The invisible things of Him<p>The attributes which constitute God's nature, afterward defined as "His eternal power and divinity."<p>From the creation (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;)<p>From the time of.
