Here it is somewhat metaphorical: “Whom I serve, not so much with outward acts as with the ritual of the spirit.”<p><span class= "bld">With my spirit.</span>—“Spirit” is with St. Paul the highest part or faculty in the nature of man. It is the seat of his higher consciousness—the organ by which he communicates with God. “Certainly man is of kin to the beasts by his body; and if he be not of kin to God by his spirit, he is a base and ignoble creature.” (Bacon, <span class= "ital">Essay on Atheism.</span>) Of itself the “spirit” of man is neutral. When brought into contact with the Spirit of God, it is capable of a truly religious life; but apart from this influence, it is apt to fall under the dominion of the “flesh”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of those evil appetites and desires to which man is exposed by his physical organisation.<p><span class= "bld">In the gospel of his Son.</span>—The sphere to which the Apostle feels himself called, and in which this heart-worship of his finds its field of operation, is the defence and preaching, &c., of the gospel.<p>(9-11) It is the constant subject of the Apostle’s prayers that he may succeed in making his way to Rome; so anxious is he to open his heart to that Church in personal- apostolic intercourse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;...">Romans 1:9-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">For God is my witness </span>— In saying I am thankful for your conversion, I might be well supposed to speak the truth, such an event being perfectly agreeable to the continual tenor of my petitions to God; <span class="ital">whom I serve </span>— Not only as a Christian, but as an apostle; <span class="ital">with my spirit</span> — With my understanding and conscience, will and affections, yea, with all the faculties of my soul, as well as with all the members of my body.

So did the Galatians likewise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>. And indeed all those churches which had the presence of any of the apostles, had peculiar advantages in this kind from the laying on of their hands, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-17.htm" title="Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.">Acts 8:17</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm" title="Why I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you by the putting on of my hands.">2 Timothy 1:6</a>. But, as yet, the Christians at Rome were greatly inferior to them in this respect; for which reason the apostle, in the 12th chapter, where he has occasion to mention gifts, says little, if any thing, of any extraordinary spiritual gifts possessed by any of them. He therefore desires to impart some to them, that they might be established in their Christian faith, and fortified against all temptations, either to renounce or dishonour it. For by these gifts the testimony of Christ was confirmed to the members of the churches. That Peter had no more been at Rome than Paul, at the time when this epistle was written, appears from the general tenor thereof, and from this place in particular. For otherwise, the gifts which Paul wishes to impart to the believers at Rome, would have been imparted already by Peter. <span class="ital">That is, that I may be comforted together with you </span>— As I have great reason to believe we shall be; <span class="ital">by the mutual faith both of you </span>— Whose faith will be strengthened and confirmed by these gifts; <span class="ital">and me </span>— Whose faith will be encouraged and increased when I see believers established, and unbelievers converted by these gifts. As often as the apostles communicated spiritual gifts to their disciples, it was a new proof to themselves of God’s presence with them, and an additional confirmation of their mission from God in the eyes of others, both of which, no doubt, gave them great joy. In this passage, we see the apostle not only associates the Romans with, but even prefers them before, himself. How different is this style of the apostle from that of the modern court of Rome!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:8-15 We must show love for our friends, not only by praying for them, but by praising God for them. As in our purposes, so in our desires, we must remember to say, If the Lord will, Jas 4:15. Our journeys are made prosperous or otherwise, according to the will of God. We should readily impart to others what God has trusted to us, rejoicing to make others joyful, especially taking pleasure in communing with those who believe the same things with us. If redeemed by the blood, and converted by the grace of the Lord Jesus, we are altogether his; and for his sake we are debtors to all men, to do all the good we can. Such services are our duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For God is my witness - The reason of this strong appeal to God is, to show to the Romans the deep interest which he felt in their welfare This interest was manifested in his prayers, and in his earnest desires to see them. A deep interest shown in this way was well suited to prepare them to receive what he had to say to them.<p>Whom I serve - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>. The expression denotes that he was devoted to God in this manner; that he obeyed him; and had given himself to do his will in making known his gospel.<p>With my spirit - Greek, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;  en, in my spirit, that is, with my "heart." It is not an external service merely; it is internal, real, sincere.

This word means constantly, always, without intermission. It was not only once, but repeatedly. It had been the burden of his prayers. The same thing he also mentions in regard to other churches, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>.<p>I make mention - I call you to remembrance, and present your case before God. This evinced his remarkable interest in a church which he had never seen, and it shows that Paul was a man of prayer; praying not for his friends and kindred only, but for those whom he had never seen. If with the same intensity of prayer all Christians, and Christian ministers, would remember the churches, what a different aspect would the Christian church soon assume!<p>Always - This word should be connected with the following verse, "Always making request," etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

These words are an appeal to God, and carry in them the nature and form of an oath; the reason of the apostle's using it was, because he was personally unknown to the Romans, and they to him, and so might doubt of his affectionate regard unto them; and therefore for the confirmation thereof he uses it: this was a case which was only known to God and himself, and hence he appeals to him for the truth of it. The object of his oath or appeal, or by which he speaks, is not himself, or anything that belonged to him, nor any creature in heaven or on earth, but God; who in a solemn oath is only to be appealed to and sworn by: he describes him as the God "whom he served", to distinguish him from all false gods, and to show that he that takes an oath, should be one that fears and serves the Lord; what he served him in was not the law, but <p>the Gospel of his Son; Jesus Christ, who is the author, minister, and subject matter of it: he served him in it, by preaching, spreading, and defending it. This is a service, and a very laborious one, and makes for the honour and glory of God. The manner in which he served him was, as he says, <p>with my Spirit; either with the Spirit of God, which was given to him; or in a spiritual manner, in opposition to the carnal worship of the Jews; internally, in opposition to bodily exercise only, and voluntarily, with his whole heart, soul, and spirit. The matter or substance of his appeal or oath was, <p>that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers; whence may be observed, that prayer to God ought to be constant; and that we should be concerned for others as well as for ourselves; all the saints should share therein. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> spirit in the <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</span><p>(r) Very willingly and with all my heart.<p>(s) In preaching his Son.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γάρ</span>] The pith of the following <span class="ital">proof of the assurance conveyed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a></span> lies in <span class="greekheb">ἀδιαλείπτως</span>, not in the desire to come to Rome, which is not subjoined till <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-10.htm" title="Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you.">Romans 1:10</a> (Th.

This is traceable in part, perhaps, to the incessant calumnies against his sincerity and veracity which grieved St Paul’s heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whom I serve</span>] The word here rendered “serve” has special reference to religious <span class="ital">worship</span>, whether paid by priests or by people. But it naturally implies also active obedience to the God so worshipped, and its <span class="ital">classical</span> usage points entirely this way.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with my spirit</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">in my spirit</span>. Much has been said on the risk of confounding “<span class="ital">in</span>” and the instrumental “<span class="ital">with</span>,” in such cases; and this risk must never be slighted. But in Heb. both ideas have the same sign, and the Hebraistic tinge of N. T. Greek makes it highly likely that in many instances there will be no practical distinction of “in” and “with.” We may well explain the present phrase, “I serve Him <span class="ital">with</span> my spirit as the instrument.” The spirit was <span class="ital">used</span> in every various way in the Master’s work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the gospel of his Son</span>] Here obviously, on the other hand, “<span class="ital">in</span>” bears its proper meaning. The Gospel was the field of energy and effort; <span class="ital">in it</span>, in expounding and spreading its message, St Paul spent his spiritual powers.—“<span class="ital">Of His Son:</span>”—see for the same idea in fuller terms, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, where lit. “The Gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.” The Eternal Son is Himself “the Gospel.” The Gospel is His, because He is not only the great Teacher but the essential Doctrine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">without ceasing</span>] As a continual and diligent habit. The same word occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm" title="Pray without ceasing.">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>, in the same sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">always in my prayers</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">always, upon my prayers;</span> i.e., “on every occasion of prayer.”—“<span class="ital">My</span> prayers;”—no doubt specially “my <span class="ital">private</span> prayers.” The Apostle did indeed “labour fervently in prayer” for his beloved converts and brethren, in his hours of direct intercourse with God. From ch. 16 we gather how individual and detailed his remembrance at such times would be.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μάρτυς</span>, <span class="ital">witness</span>) A pious asseveration respecting a matter necessary [Paul’s secret prayer for them], and hidden from men, especially from those, who were remote and unknown,—<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>.—<span class="greekheb">λατρεύω</span>, <span class="ital">I serve</span>), as an apostle, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a>.

It expresses the writer's earnestness, and is in place for attestation of a fact known only to himself and God. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, ("I serve"), when used in a religious sense, most usually denotes "worship," and specifically the priestly services of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-2.htm">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>).
