Or, as Dr. Macknight interprets it, They “did not approve of holding God as the object of the people’s acknowledgment and worship, but approved of the worship of false gods and of images, as more proper for the vulgar; and on that account substituted idolatry in place of the pure, spiritual worship of the one true God, and established it by law.” Therefore <span class="ital">God gave them over to a reprobate mind </span>— <span class="greekheb">αδοκιμον νουν</span>, <span class="ital">an undiscerning, </span>or <span class="ital">injudicious mind; </span>a mind not perceiving or approving what is good, either in principle or practice; a mind void of all proper knowledge and relish of what is excellent, treated of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-32.htm" title="Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.">Romans 1:32</a>.

The truth was not to their taste. And we all know how soon a man will contrive, against the strongest evidence, to reason himself out of the belief of what he dislikes. But a man cannot be brought to greater slavery than to be given up to his own lusts. As the Gentiles did not like to keep God in their knowledge, they committed crimes wholly against reason and their own welfare. The nature of man, whether pagan or Christian, is still the same; and the charges of the apostle apply more or less to the state and character of men at all times, till they are brought to full submission to the faith of Christ, and renewed by Divine power. There never yet was a man, who had not reason to lament his strong corruptions, and his secret dislike to the will of God. Therefore this chapter is a call to self-examination, the end of which should be, a deep conviction of sin, and of the necessity of deliverance from a state of condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And even as they did not like ... - This was the true source of their crimes. They did not choose to acknowledge God.

This was the first step in their sin. It was not that God compelled them; or that he did not give them knowledge; nor even is it said that he arbitrarily abandoned them as the first step; but they forsook him, and as a consequence he gave them up to a reprobate mind.<p>To a reprobate mind - A mind destitute of judgment. In the Greek the same word is used here, which, in another form, occurs in the previous part of the verse, and which is translated "like." The apostle meant doubtless to retain a reference to that in this place. "As they did not approve, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  edokimasan, or choose to retain God, etc. he gave them up to a mind disapproved, rejected, reprobate," &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  adokimon, and he means that the state of their minds was such that God could not approve it. It does not mean that they were reprobate by any arbitrary decree; but that as a consequence of their headstrong passions, their determination to forget him, he left them to a state of mind which was evil, and which he could not approve.<p>Which are not convenient - Which are not fit or proper; which are disgraceful and shameful; to wit, those things which he proceeds to state in the remainder of the chapter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28-31. gave them over&#8212;or "up" (see on [2182]Ro 1:24).<p>to do those things which are not convenient&#8212;in the old sense of that word, that is, "not becoming," "indecorous," "shameful."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To retain God in their knowledge; </span> or, to have God in acknowledgment.

The characters are summed up, so to speak, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-32.htm" title="Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.">Romans 1:32</a> : <span class="greekheb">οἵτινες τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ θεοῦ ἐπιγνόντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: such persons as, though they know the sentence of God, that those who practise such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but give a whole-hearted complacent assent to those who follow the same practice. <span class="greekheb">τὸ δικαίωμα τοῦ θεοῦ</span> is that which God has pronounced to be the right, and has thereby established as the proper moral order of the world. <span class="greekheb">θάνατος</span> is death, not as a natural period to life, but as a Divine sentence executed on sin: it is not to be defined as physical, or spiritual, or eternal; by an such abstract analysis it is robbed of part of its meaning, which is as wide as that of life or the soul. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ συνευδοκοῦσιν</span>: to be guilty of such things oneself, under the impulse of passion, is bad; but it is a more malignant badness to give a cordial and disinterested approval to them in others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is a mistake to read these verses as if they were a scientific contribution to comparative religion, but equally a mistake to ignore their weight. Paul is face to face with a world in which the vices he enumerates are rampant, and it is his deliberate judgment that these vices have a real connection with the pagan religions. Who will deny that he was both a competent observer and a competent judge? Religion and morality in the great scale hang together, and morality in the long run is determined by religion. Minds which accepted the religious ideas of Phenicia, of Egypt or of Greece (as represented in the popular mythologies) could not be pure. Their morality, or rather their immorality, is conceived as a Divine judgment upon their religion; and as for their religion, nature itself, the Apostle argues, should have saved them from such ignorance of God, and such misconceptions of Him, as deformed every type of heathenism. A converted pagan (as much as Paul) would be filled with horror as he reflected on the way in which he had once thought of God; he would feel in himself that he ought to have known better, and that everything in the world cried shame upon him. Now to recognise this fact is to accept the premises of the Apostle’s argument, and the use to which he puts it. “Once we went after dumb idols; our very worship led us into sin, and sometimes even consecrated it; now we can only see in this our own blindness and guilt, and God’s judgment upon them”—so we can fancy the converted pagan speaking. Such a world, then, as the Apostle describes in this chapter, with this terrible principle of degeneration at work in it, and no power of self-regeneration, is a world which waits for a righteousness of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For an interesting attempt to show Paul’s indebtedness for some of the ideas and arguments of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;...">Romans 1:18-32</a> to the book of Wisdom, see S. and H., p. 51 f.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">And even as</span>, &c.] In this and the following verses the developements of sin are followed into less monstrous but more pervading and not less guilty forms.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as they did not like</span>] <span class="bld">did not approve</span>.

It is difficult to render in English <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> so as to retain the apparently intended correspondence between the verb and the adjective. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is capable of the senses <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "to prove" (as in assaying metals), and, generally, "to discern," or "judge;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "to approve," after supposed proving. Jowett, in his commentary on this Epistle, endeavours to retain in English the correspondence between <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> by translating, "As they did not <span class="accented">discern</span> to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to an <span class="accented">undiscerning</span> mind," thus taking the verb in sense (1), and the adjective in the same sense actively. But it is at least doubtful whether <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> can be taken in an active sense, which is not its classical one. In the New Testament it occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>. In the first of the above passages the word obviously means "rejected" (in the Authorized Version <span class="accented">a castaway</span>), with reference to the comparison of a competitor in athletic contests being proved unworthy of the prize - a sense cognate to the common one of the same adjective as applied to spurious metals, rejected or worthless after being tested. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5, 6</a>, either sense seems admissible - <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. But not so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-8.htm">Hebrews 6:8</a>, where the word is applied to barren land. The passages from 2 Timothy and Titus may in themselves admit the sense of <span class="accented">undiscerning</span>, but the passive one is more probable in view of the common usage of the word. On the other hand, ch. 12:2 may be adduced in favour of the active sense; for there the consequence of the renewal of the mind in Christians is said to be that they may <span class="accented">prove</span>, or <span class="accented">discern</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>), what is Gods will; and hence it may seem probable that the want of such <span class="accented">discernment is</span> denoted here. The same passage also favours the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> being taken here in sense (1) given above, and Jowett's rendering of the whole passage. It is, after all, uncertain; nor does it follow that the Greek <span class="accented">paronomasia</span> can be reproduced in English. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Even as<p>Expressing the correlation between the sin and the punishment.<p>They did not like to have God in their knowledge (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;).<p>Lit., did not approve. Rev., refused. They did not think God worth the knowing. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>. Knowledge (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;) is, literally, full knowledge. They did not suffer the rudimentary revelation of nature to develop into full knowledge - "a penetrating and living knowledge of God" (Meyer). In Dante's division of Hell, the section assigned to Incontinence, or want of self-control, is succeeded by that of Bestiality, or besotted folly, which comprises infidelity and heresy in all their forms - sin which Dante declares to be the most stupid, vile, and hurtful of follies. Thus the want of self-restraint is linked with the failure to have God in knowledge. Self is truly possessed only in God. The tendency of this is ever downward toward that demoniac animalism which is incarnated in Lucifer at the apex of the infernal cone, and which is so powerfully depicted in this chapter. See "Inferno," ix.<p>Reprobate mind (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., not standing the test. See on is tried, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>; and see on trial, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>. There is a play upon the words. As they did not approve, God gave them up unto a mind disapproved. This form of play upon words of similar sound is perhaps the most frequent of Paul's rhetorical figures, often consisting in the change of preposition in a compound, or in the addition of a preposition to the simple verb. Thus &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769; circumcision, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769; concision, <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>.

The word reprobate is from re-probare, to reject on a second trial, hence, to condemn. </body></html>
