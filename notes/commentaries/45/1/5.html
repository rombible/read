St. Augustine notes that grace is common to the Apostle with all believers—his apostleship is something special and peculiar; yet apostleship is an instance, or case, of grace. Origen distinguishes between the two—“grace for the endurance of labours, apostleship for authority in preaching;” but both terms are perhaps somewhat wider than this. Apostleship includes all those privileges which St. Paul possessed as an Apostle; grace is all those privileges that he possessed as a Christian. At the same time, in either case the meaning tends in the direction of that particular object which is expressed in the next clause. The light in which the Apostle valued most the gifts that had been bestowed upon him, was inasmuch as they enabled him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">For obedience to the faith among all nations.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">For</span> (to produce) <span class= "ital">obedience of faith</span> (the obedience which springs from faith) <span class= "ital">among all the Gentiles.</span><p>Faith is not here equivalent to “<span class= "ital">the</span> faith”—a positive body of doctrine received and believed—but, in its strict sense, that active habit and attitude of mind by which the Christian shows his devotion and loyalty to Christ, and his total dependence on Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For his name.</span>—<span class= "ital">For His name’s sake.</span> “His,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Christ’s. The whole of that divine economy of which St. Paul himself forms part, tends to the glory of Christ. The Apostle’s call to his office, his special endowment for his ministry, the success of his preaching among the Gentiles, as they proceed from Christ, so also have for their object the extension of His kingdom.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-7 The doctrine of which the apostle Paul wrote, set forth the fulfilment of the promises by the prophets. It spoke of the Son of God, even Jesus the Saviour, the promised Messiah, who came from David as to his human nature, but was also declared to be the Son of God, by the Divine power which raised him from the dead. The Christian profession does not consist in a notional knowledge or a bare assent, much less in perverse disputings, but in obedience. And all those, and those only, are brought to obedience of the faith, who are effectually called of Jesus Christ. Here is, 1. The privilege of Christians; they are beloved of God, and are members of that body which is beloved. 2. The duty of Christians; to be holy, hereunto are they called, called to be saints. These the apostle saluted, by wishing them grace to sanctify their souls, and peace to comfort their hearts, as springing from the free mercy of God, the reconciled Father of all believers, and coming to them through the Lord Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By whom - The apostle here returns to the subject of the salutation of the Romans, and states to them his authority to address them. That authority he had derived from the Lord Jesus, and not from man. On this fact, that he had received his apostolic commission, not from man, but by the direct authority of Jesus Christ, Paul not infrequently insisted. <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>, "for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by revelation of Jesus Christ;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-3</a>.<p>We - The plural here is probably put for the singular; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19-20</a>. It was usual for those who were clothed with authority to express themselves in this manner. Perhaps here, however, he refers to the general nature of the apostolic office, as being derived from Jesus Christ, and designs to assure the Romans that "he" had received the apostolic commission as the others had. 'We," the apostles, have received the appointment from Jesus Christ. '<p>Grace and apostleship - Many suppose that this is a figure of speech, "hendiadys," by which one thing is expressed by two words, meaning the grace or favor of the apostolic office. Such a figure of speech is often used. But it may mean, as it does probably here, the two things, grace, or the favor of God to his own soul, as a personal matter; and the apostolic office as a distinct thing. He often, however, speaks of the office of the apostleship as a matter of special favor, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm">Ephesians 3:7-9</a>.<p>For obedience to the faith - In order to produce, or promote obedience to the faith; that is, to induce them to render that obedience to God which faith produces. There are two things therefore implied.<p>(1) that the design of the gospel and of the apostleship is to induce men to obey God.<p>(2) that the tendency of faith is to produce obedience. There is no true faith which does not produce that. This is constantly affirmed in the New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-19.htm">Romans 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-15.htm">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2.htm">James 2</a>.<p>Among all nations - This was the original commission which Jesus gave to his apostles, <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15-16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-19</a>. This was the special commission which Paul received when he was converted, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>. It was important to show that the commission extended thus far, as he was now addressing a distant church which he had not seen.<p>For his name - This means probably "on his account," that is, on account of Christ, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13-14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-23.htm">John 16:23-24</a>. The design of the apostleship was to produce obedience to the gospel among all nations, that thus the name of Jesus might be honored. Their work was not one in which they were seeking to honor themselves, but it was solely for the honor and glory of Jesus Christ. For him they toiled, they encountered perils, they laid down their lives, because by so doing they might bring people to obey the gospel, and thus Jesus Christ might wear a brighter crown and be attended by a longer and more splendid train of worshippers in the kingdom of his glory. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

That is, either by the Holy Spirit, from whom all grace and gifts come, qualifying for the discharge of any office; or by the Lord Jesus Christ, who is full of grace and truth, has received gifts for, and gives them to men to fit them for whatsoever service he is pleased to call them to. By "grace and apostleship" may be meant, either one and the same thing, the favour and honour of being the apostles of Christ; or different things, and the one in order to the other. Grace may design special saving grace in calling, justification, pardon, and adoption, and sanctification, which was received in common with other saints, and is absolutely necessary to an apostle, and to any ordinary minister of the word; or the doctrine of grace, which they received from Christ, and dispensed to others; or rather the gifts of grace, and the various measures thereof, which they received from their ascended Lord and King, by which they were furnished for apostleship, that is, the work and office of apostles; to which they were called by Christ, and from whom they received a commission to execute it. The apostle takes in others sides himself, and says, "we have received"; partly for the sake of modesty, and partly to keep up his equal title with others to this office; and since this is had in a way of receiving, which supposes giving, and excludes boasting, it obliges to make use of all grace and gifts to the glory of Christ, by whom they are received. The end for which they received such an office, and grace to fit them for it, was, "for obedience to the faith"; that men might be brought by the ministry of the word to obey the faith, Christ the object of faith; to submit to his righteousness, and the way of salvation by him, and to be subject to his ordinances or to obey the doctrine of faith, which is not barely to hear it, and notionally receive it, but to embrace it heartily by faith, and retain it, in opposition to a disbelief and contempt of it; and which is the end and design of the Gospel ministration to bring persons to, Moreover, by <p>obedience to the faith, or "obedience of faith", as it may be rendered, may be meant the grace of faith, attended with evangelical obedience; for obedience, rightly performed, is only that which is by faith, and springs from it. Now grace and apostleship were received, in order to be exercised <p>among all nations; not in Judea only, to which the first commission of apostleship was limited, but in all the nations of the world, as the commission renewed by Christ after his resurrection ordered; and that some among all nations of the earth might, by the power of divine grace accompanying the word, be brought to faith and obedience: and all this, the qualifications for the office, the due exercise of it in all the world, and the success that attended it, were <p>for his name; for the honour and glory of Christ, in whose name they went, and which they bore and carried among the Gentiles, out of whom he was pleased "to take a people for his name", <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{i}</span> By whom we have received <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> grace and apostleship, for <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> obedience to the faith <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> among all nations, for his name:</span><p>(i) Of whom.<p>(k) This marvellous, liberal, and gracious gift, which is given to me, the least of all the saints, to preach, etc.; see Eph 3:8.<p>(l) That men through faith might obey God.<p>(m) For his name's sake.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm" title="By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:">Romans 1:5</a>.

Faith <span class="ital">alone</span> (to the exclusion of works) is the causa apprehendens of the salvation promised and obtained through Christ; but, because it transfers us into living and devoted fellowship with Him, altogether of a moral character, it becomes the subjective moral power of the new life regenerated through the power of the Holy Spirit—of the life <span class="ital">in</span> Christ, which, however, is the necessary consequence, and never the ground of justification.

The question is, after all, of no importance with regard to the essential idea intended to be conveyed. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> seems to point especially to St. Paul's own apostleship (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1, 8</a>), though, of course, the apostleship of all, wherever exercised, had a similar worldwide purpose. In using the expression here, he anticipates what he is about to say as to his not shrinking from addressing even the Romans with authority; his mission being to <span class="accented">all</span> the nations. <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is best connected with "obedience of faith." The phrase is of frequent occurrence (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-26.htm">Acts 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-13.htm">Acts 21:13</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>). It is most usually connected with the idea of suffering in behalf of Christ. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>We have received (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Aorist tense. Rev., we received. The categorical plural, referring to Paul, and not including the other apostles, since the succeeding phrase, among all the nations, points to himself alone as the apostle to the Gentiles.<p>Grace and apostleship<p>Grace, the general gift bestowed on all believers: apostleship, the special manifestation of grace to Paul. The connecting &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; and, has the force of and in particular. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>.<p>For obedience to the faith (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., unto obedience of faith. Unto marks the object of the grace and apostleship: in order to bring about. Obedience of faith is the obedience which characterizes and proceeds from faith.<p>Nations (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Or Gentiles. Not geographically, contrasting the inhabitants of the world, Jew and Gentile, with the Jews strictly so called, dwelling in Palestine, but Gentiles distinctively, for whom Paul's apostleship was specially instituted.
