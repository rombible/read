The promise is the same to all, who call on the name of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, as God manifest in the flesh. All believers thus call upon the Lord Jesus, and none else will do so humbly or sincerely. But how should any call on the Lord Jesus, the Divine Saviour, who had not heard of him? And what is the life of a Christian but a life of prayer? It shows that we feel our dependence on him, and are ready to give up ourselves to him, and have a believing expectation of our all from him. It was necessary that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles. Somebody must show them what they are to believe. How welcome the gospel ought to be to those to whom it was preached! The gospel is given, not only to be known and believed, but to be obeyed. It is not a system of notions, but a rule of practice. The beginning, progress, and strength of faith is by hearing. But it is only hearing the word, as the word of God that will strengthen faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For whosoever shall call ... - This sentiment is found substantially in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>, "And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered." This is expressly applied to the times of the gospel, by Peter, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>; see the note on that place. To call on the name of the Lord is the same as to call on the Lord himself. The word "name" is often used in this manner. "The name of the Lord is a strong tower, etc.;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>. "The name of the God of Jacob defend thee;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-1.htm">Psalm 20:1</a>. That is, God himself is a strong tower, etc. It is clear from what follows, that the apostle applies this to Jesus Christ; and this is one of the numerous instances in which the writers of the New Testament apply to him expressions which in the Old Testament are applicable to God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>.<p>Shall be saved - This is the uniform promise; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>, "Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord." This is proper and indispensable because,<p>(1) We have sinned against God, and it is right that we should confess it.<p>(2) because he only can pardon us, and it is fit, that if we obtain pardon, we should ask it of God.<p>(3) to call upon him is to acknowledge him as our Sovereign, our Father, and our Friend; and it is right that we render him our homage.<p>It is implied in this, that we call upon him with right feelings; that is, with a humble sense of our sinfulness and our need of pardon, and with a willingness to receive eternal life as it is offered us in the gospel. And if this be done, this passage teaches us that all may be saved who will do it. He will cast none away who come in this manner. The invitation and the assurance extend to all nations and to people of all times. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

The apostle’s argument may be thus formed: If whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved, then the Lord is rich to all that call upon him; for no riches are comparable to salvation; but the former is true, therefore the latter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whosoever, </span> whether Jew or Gentile, <span class="bld">shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved; </span> i.e. on him whose name is the Lord.
