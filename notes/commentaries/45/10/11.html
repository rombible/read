When we speak of looking upon Christ, and receiving, and feeding upon him, it is not Christ in heaven, nor Christ in the deep, that we mean; but Christ in the promise, Christ offered in the word. Justification by faith in Christ is a plain doctrine. It is brought before the mind and heart of every one, thus leaving him without excuse for unbelief. If a man confessed faith in Jesus, as the Lord and Saviour of lost sinners, and really believed in his heart that God had raised him from the dead, thus showing that he had accepted the atonement, he should be saved by the righteousness of Christ, imputed to him through faith. But no faith is justifying which is not powerful in sanctifying the heart, and regulating all its affections by the love of Christ. We must devote and give up to God our souls and our bodies: our souls in believing with the heart, and our bodies in confessing with the mouth. The believer shall never have cause to repent his confident trust in the Lord Jesus. Of such faith no sinner shall be ashamed before God; and he ought to glory in it before men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the Scripture saith ... - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>.

Of this form of expression, or mode of speaking; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>. The passage referred to is <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, cited before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; the view with which it is produced is to prove the certain connection between faith and righteousness, and confession and salvation; or in other words, to observe that such who cordially believe in Christ, and make a sincere profession of their faith in him, shall be saved. There are some things somewhat different from, though agreeing in sense with, the words as they stand in the prophet; there it is indefinitely said, "he that believeth", here an universal is made use of, <p>whosoever, or "everyone" <p>that believeth: which phrases are equipollent, and a certain truth it is, that whosoever believes in Christ, whether Jew or Gentile, be he who he will, shall surely be saved: here the object believed in, is expressed <p>in him, which is there implied, and may easily be understood of the stone laid in Zion for a foundation, which is Christ; for other foundation can no man lay, and whoever by faith builds on this foundation is safe: <p>and shall not be ashamed; neither in this world, nor in that to come; in the Hebrew text it is, "shall not make haste"; how this may be reconciled; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-2.htm">Romans 9:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> For the scripture saith, Whosoever <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</span><p>(7) Now he proves the other part which he propounded before in the fourth verse, that is, that Christ calls whoever he wishes without any difference, and this confirms by a twofold testimony, Ro 10:4.<p>(k) To believe in God is to yield and consent to God's promise of our salvation by Christ, and that not only in general, but when we know that the promises pertain to us, from which arises a sure trust.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-11.htm" title="For the scripture said, Whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 10:11</a>.

(<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>), has been proved from Moses himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-5.htm" title="For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them....">Romans 10:5-8</a>), and this proof has received its confirmatory discussion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-9.htm" title="That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved....">Romans 10:9-10</a>), Paul brings forward, as if <span class="ital">for the solemn sealing of all this</span>, once more that weighty word of Scripture which he has already adduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a>. But this scriptural saying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a>) now receives, with the object of closely connecting with it what is further to follow, the significant addition of the <span class="ital">universal</span> element <span class="greekheb">πᾶς</span> (perhaps already with a regard to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-5.htm" title="Because you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things:">Joel 3:5</a>), which indeed is found neither in the LXX. nor in the Hebrew; but in the unlimited <span class="greekheb">ὁ πιστεύων</span> in Isaiah, ground and justification for its appearance was found to the apostle’s mind, since he had the sacred historical <span class="ital">fulfilment</span> of the prophecy before his eyes, and therein its more particular definitive character.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-11.htm" title="For the scripture said, Whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 10:11</a>. This verse proves from Scripture the main idea in the preceding, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that faith saves. It is a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a>) with the addition of <span class="greekheb">πᾶς</span>, to which nothing corresponds either in Hebr. or LXX. Yet oddly enough it is on this <span class="greekheb">πᾶς</span> that the rest of the Apostle’s argument turns.
