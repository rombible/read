Just as Isaiah had said.<p>The argument does not run quite smoothly. The Apostle has two thoughts in his mind: (1) the necessity that the gospel should be preached before it could be believed; (2) the fact that, although it was preached (and accepted by many among the Gentiles), it was not accepted by the Jews. He begins to introduce this second topic before he has quite done with the first. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm" title="So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.">Romans 10:17</a> goes back to and connects logically with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-15.htm" title="And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!">Romans 10:15</a>, while <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-16.htm" title="But they have not all obeyed the gospel.

The promise is the same to all, who call on the name of the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, as God manifest in the flesh. All believers thus call upon the Lord Jesus, and none else will do so humbly or sincerely. But how should any call on the Lord Jesus, the Divine Saviour, who had not heard of him? And what is the life of a Christian but a life of prayer? It shows that we feel our dependence on him, and are ready to give up ourselves to him, and have a believing expectation of our all from him. It was necessary that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles. Somebody must show them what they are to believe. How welcome the gospel ought to be to those to whom it was preached! The gospel is given, not only to be known and believed, but to be obeyed. It is not a system of notions, but a rule of practice. The beginning, progress, and strength of faith is by hearing. But it is only hearing the word, as the word of God that will strengthen faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But they have not all obeyed the gospel - It is not easy to see the connection of this; and it has been made a question whether this is to be regarded as a continuation of the objection of the Jew, or as a part of the answer of the apostle. After all the attention which I have been able to give it, I am inclined to regard it as an admission of the apostle, as if he had said, "It must be admitted that all have not obeyed the gospel. So far as the objection of the Jew arises from that fact, and so far as that fact can bear on the case, it is to be conceded that all have not yielded obedience to the gospel. For this was clearly declared even by the prophet;" compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-24.htm">Acts 28:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm">Hebrews 4:2</a>.<p>For Esaias saith - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>.<p>Who hath believed our report? - That is, Isaiah complains that his declarations respecting the Messiah had been rejected by his countrymen. The form of expression, "Who hath believed?" is a mode of saying emphatically that few or none had done it. The great mass of his countrymen had rejected it. This was an example to the purpose of the apostle. In the time of Isaiah this fact existed; and it was not a new thing that it existed in the time of the gospel. "Our report." Our message; or what is delivered to be heard and believed. It originally means the doctrine which Isaiah delivered about the Messiah; and implies that the same thing would occur when the Messiah should actually come. Hence, in the fifty-third chapter he proceeds to give the reasons why the report would not be credited. and why the Messiah would be rejected. It would be because he was a root out of a dry ground; because he was a man of sorrows. etc. And this actually took place. Because he did not come with splendor and pomp, as a temporal prince, he was rejected, and put to death. On substantially the same grounds he is even yet rejected by thousands. The force of this verse, perhaps, may be best seen by including it in a parenthesis, "How beautiful are the feet, etc." how important is the gospel ministry - (although it must be admitted, that all have not obeyed, for this was predicted also by Isaiah, etc.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17.

The historic aorist corresponds closely to <span class="greekheb">ὑπήκουσαν</span>.

The fact remains, however, in spite of this universal preaching, that there has not been a universal surrender to the Gospel. <span class="greekheb">οὐ πάντες</span>: the Jews are present to the writer’s mind here, though the words might apply more widely; hence the compassionate mode of statement. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-3.htm" title="For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?">Romans 3:3</a> : <span class="greekheb">εἰ ἠπίστησάν τινες</span>. Yet this quantum of unbelief does not discomfit the Apostle; for it also, as well as the proclamation of the Gospel, is included in the prophecy. <span class="greekheb">τίς ἐπίστευσεν τῇ ἀκοῇ ἡμῶν</span> is a lament over practically universal unbelief. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀκοὴ ἡμῶν</span> in Isaiah means “that which we heard,” but who the “we” are is not clear.
