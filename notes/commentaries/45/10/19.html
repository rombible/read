They might have known it from Moses and Isaiah. Isaiah speaks plainly of the grace and favour of God, as going before in the receiving of the Gentiles. Was not this our own case? Did not God begin in love, and make himself known to us when we did not ask after him? The patience of God towards provoking sinners is wonderful. The time of God's patience is called a day, light as day, and fit for work and business; but limited as a day, and there is a night at the end of it. God's patience makes man's disobedience worse, and renders that the more sinful. We may wonder at the mercy of God, that his goodness is not overcome by man's badness; we may wonder at the wickedness of man, that his badness is not overcome by God's goodness. And it is a matter of joy to think that God has sent the message of grace to so many millions, by the wide spread of his gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I say ... - Still further to meet the objection, he shows that the doctrine which he was maintaining was actually taught in the Old Testament.<p>Did not Israel know? - Did not the Jews understand. Is it not recorded in their books, etc. that they had full opportunity to be acquainted with this truth? This question is an emphatic way of affirming that they did know. But Paul does not here state what it was that they knew. That is to be gathered from what he proceeds to say. From that it appears that he referred to the fact that the gospel was to be preached to the Gentiles, and that the Jews were to be cast off. This doctrine followed from what he had already maintained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12-13</a>, that there was no difference in regard to the terms of salvation, and that the Jew had no particular privileges. If so, then the barrier was broken down; and if the Jews did not believe in Jesus Christ, they must be rejected. Against this was the objection in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14-15</a>, that they could not believe; that they had not heard; and that a preacher had not been sent to them. If, now, the apostle could show that it was an ancient doctrine of the Jewish prophets that the Gentiles should believe, and that the Jews would not believe, the whole force of the objection would vanish. Accordingly he proceeds to show that this doctrine was distinctly taught in the Old Testament.<p>First - First in order; as we say, in the first place.<p>I will provoke you - These words are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>. In that place the declaration refers to the idolatrous and wicked conduct of the Jews. God says that they had provoked him, or excited his indignation, by worshipping what was not God, that is, by idols; and he, in turn, would excite their envy and indignation by showing favors to those who were not regarded as a people; that is, to the Gentiles. They had shown favor, or affection, for what was not God, and by so doing had provoked him to anger; and he also would show favor to those whom they regarded as no people, and would thus excite their anger. Thus, he would illustrate the great principle of his government in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-26.htm">2 Samuel 22:26-27</a>, "With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with the pure, thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt show thyself unsavory," that is, froward. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>. In this passage the great doctrine which Paul was defending is abundantly established - that the Gentiles were to be brought into the favor of God; and the cause also is suggested to be the obstinacy and rebellion of the Jews. It is not clear that Moses had particularly in view the times of the gospel; but he affirms a great principle which is applicable to those times - that if the Jews should be rebellious, and prove themselves unworthy of his favor, that favor would be withdrawn, and conferred on other nations. The effect of this would be, of course, to excite their indignation. This principle the apostle applies to his own times; and affirms that it ought to have been understood by the Jews themselves.<p>That are no people - That is, those whom you regard as unworthy the name of a people. Those who have no government, laws, or regular organization; who wander in tribes and clans, and who are under no settled form of society. This was the case with most barbarians; and the Jews, evidently regarded all ancient nations in this light, as unworthy the name of a people.<p>A foolish nation - The word "fool" means one void of understanding. But it also means one who is wicked, or idolatrous; one who contemns God. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>, "the fool hath said in his heart, there is no God." <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, "fools despise wisdom and instruction." Here it means a nation who had no understanding of the true God &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;  asuneto&#772;.<p>I will anger - My bestowing favors on them will excite your anger. We may remark here,<p>(1) That God is a sovereign, and has a right to bestow his favors on whom he pleases.<p>(2) that when people abuse his mercies, become proud, or cold, or dead in his service, he often takes away their privileges, and bestows them on others.<p>(3) that the effect of his sovereignty is to excite people to anger.<p>Proud and wicked people are always enraged that he bestows his favors on others; and the effect of his sovereign dealings is, to provoke to anger the very people who by their sins have rejected his mercy. Hence, there is no doctrine that proud man hates so cordially as he does the doctrine of divine sovereignty; and none that will so much test the character of the wicked. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. But I say, Did not Israel know?&#8212;know, from their own Scriptures, of God's intention to bring in the Gentiles?<p>First&#8212;that is First in the prophetic line [De Wette].<p>Moses saith, &c.&#8212;"I will provoke you to jealousy ('against') [them that are] not a nation, and against a nation without understanding will I anger you" (De 32:21). In this verse God warns His ancient people that because they had (that is, in aftertimes would) moved Him to jealousy with their "no-gods," and provoked Him to anger with their vanities, He in requital would move them to jealousy by receiving into His favor a "no-people," and provoke them to anger by adopting a nation void of understanding.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here he proves by three testimonies out of the Old Testament, that the Jews must needs have heard the sound of the gospel, together with the Gentiles; only they rejected it, when the other embraced it. And so he layeth the ground of what he was purposed to handle in the following chapter, concerning the receiving of the Gentiles, and the casting off, and after calling, of the Jews. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Did not Israel know; </span> here something must be supplied to make up the sense neither God, or the gospel, or the righteousness of faith, or the conversion of the Gentiles.

They had chosen to themselves such as were no gods; and therefore, to requite them, God would take to him such as were no people: they had chosen to themselves (as it were) another husband; and God, to be even with them, had chosen another wife. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But I say, did not Israel know? Some supply the word "God", did not Israel know God? verily, they did; they knew the being and perfections of God, the unity of God, and the trinity of persons in the divine essence; they knew the will of God, and the right way of worshipping him; for they were favoured with a divine revelation; to them were committed the oracles of God, and to them belonged the giving of the "Gospel", did not Israel know the Gospel? yes, they did; they not only heard it, but knew it; not spiritually and experimentally, but nationally and speculatively, and, against the light and conviction of their own minds, obstinately rejected it with contempt: but I rather think this question refers to the calling of the Gentiles, and their own rejection; and the sense is, did not Israel know, that the Gentiles were to be called by the grace of God, and that they themselves were to be cast off? they did know this, at least something of it, though not so clearly as it is now revealed to the holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit; but in some measure they could not but know it, since there were such strong hints of it in the writings of the Old Testament, some of which are hereafter produced: <p>first Moses saith; not "Moses the first", as if there was another, or a second Moses, but either Moses, who is the first of the inspired writers, and chief of the prophets; or rather this regards order of time, Moses in the first place says so and so, for other testimonies are after cited; the passage in Moses referred to, is <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>. <p>I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you. The Gentiles are here designed by "them that are no people": who before God, and in his sight, as all nations are, were as a drop of the bucket, as the small dust of the balance: nay, even as nothing, yea, less than nothing and vanity: likewise they were no people of any account, of any name; they were mean and contemptible, neglected and overlooked by God himself, and treated with contempt by the Jews, his professing people: and besides, they were not as yet openly and visibly the people of God; they neither called upon his name, nor were they called by his name; he had not as yet taken from among them a people for his name: these are also meant by "the foolish nation"; Jarchi (m) says, the Cuthites, or Samaritans, are intended; who were neighbours to the Jews, and greatly hated by them: but it may more rightly be applied to all the Gentiles in general, who notwithstanding their large pretensions to natural, civil, and moral wisdom, yet being without a true knowledge of God, Christ, and the Gospel, were a foolish people; and in nothing more did their folly appear, than in their idolatry and superstition. Now the Lord threatened by these people to provoke the Jews to jealousy, and to anger them; and this was but just, and by way of retaliation; for since they provoked him to jealousy and anger, by worshipping strange gods, which plainly declared their want of faith in him, affection for him, and their departure from him; it was a righteous thing in him to provoke them to jealousy of him, as if he had no affection for them, who had been so long, in some sense, an husband to them all; and as about to cast them off; and to anger them, by sending his Gospel among the Gentiles, and calling them by his grace, and making them partakers of his special favours; whereby this prophecy had its full accomplishment: for though the Jews rejected and despised the Gospel themselves, yet nothing more provoked them than that it should be carried among the Gentiles; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>. Now from these words of Moses, the Israelites must needs know, they could not but know that it was the will of God to call the Gentiles, and reject them. <p>(m) In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>.21. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{13}</span> But I say, Did not Israel know?

Isaiah, says the apostle, denies it: and witnesses that the Gospel was taken from them and given to the Gentiles, because the Jews rejected it. In addition the apostle teaches that the outward and universal calling, which is set forth by the creation of the world, is not sufficient for the knowledge of God: indeed, and that the particular calling also which is by the preaching of the word of God, is of itself of little or no efficacy, unless it is apprehended or laid hold of by faith, which is the gift of God: otherwise by unbelief it is made unprofitable, and that by the only fault of man, who can pretend no ignorance.<p>(n) He calls all profane people <i>them that are</i> no people, as they are not said to live but to die, who are appointed for everlasting condemnation.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-19.htm" title="But I say, Did not Israel know?

The “<span class="ital">it</span>” to be supplied with <span class="greekheb">ἔγνω</span> (see Nägelsbach, <span class="ital">z. Ilias</span>, p. 120, ed. 3) is: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν γῆν ἐξελεύσεται ὁ φθόγγος αὐτῶν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. This universal destination of the preaching of Christ expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-18.htm" title="But I say, Have they not heard? Yes truly, their sound went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.">Romans 10:18</a> must have been known by the Jews, for long ago Moses and also Isaiah had prophesied the conversion of the Gentiles<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Isaiah likewise, the refractory spirit of opposition thereto of the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-20.htm" title="But Esaias is very bold, and said, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not after me....">Romans 10:20-21</a>). This reference of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἜΓΝΩ</span></span></span> alone (followed also by de Wette, Fritzsche, and Tholuck) flows purely in accordance with the text from what immediately precedes, and is at the same time naturally in keeping with the contents of the corresponding biblical passages; for the conversion of the Gentiles and the universality of Christianity are one; since the former was prophesied to the Jews, the latter could not be unknown to them; and they could not therefore allege as the excuse for their unbelief: We did not know that Christianity is destined for the whole of humanity—the less could they do so, since Isaiah places before them the true source of their unbelief in their own spirit of resistance. The view of the passage which comes substantially nearest to ours, is that of Thomas Aquinas, Cornelius a Lapide, Piscator, Pareus, Toletus, Calovius, Turretine, Morus, Rosenmüller, Koppe, Benecke, Köllner, Ewald (comp. Tholuck), who supply with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἜΓΝΩ</span></span></span>: <span class="ital">that the gospel would pass over from the Jews to the Gentiles</span>. So Pelagius and Theodore of Mopsuestia: <span class="greekheb">τὸ τοὺς ἐξ ἐθνῶν προσειλῆφθαι εἰς τὴν εὐσέβειαν</span>. But this is wrong, in so far as the object to be supplied is not purely borrowed from the preceding, but is already in part anticipated from what follows. Beza has vaguely and erroneously supplied <span class="ital">Deum</span>, with <span class="greekheb">ἔγνω</span>; Reithmayr, on the other hand, thinks no object is to be supplied; while others imagine <span class="ital">the gospel</span> to be the object (“Have they not learnt to know the gospel, in order to be able to believe in it?”). So Chrysostom, Vatablus, Gomarus, Hammond, Estius, and several others, including Rückert, Olshausen, van Hengel, Beyschlag, Mangold, and, with a peculiar turn, Philippi also; similarly Hofmann and others, taking up the following <span class="greekheb">πρῶτος</span> (see below). In that case—against which there is no objection in itself<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ἸΣΡΑῊΛ ΟὐΚ ἜΓΝΩ</span></span></span> would be so complete a parallel to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΟὐΚ ἬΚΟΥΣΑΝ</span></span></span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-18.htm" title="But I say, Have they not heard? Yes truly, their sound went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.">Romans 10:18</a>, that here, as there, <span class="ital">the gospel</span> would have to be supplied. But as this is by no means necessary (in opposition to Hofmann)—since it fully satisfies the symmetry of the discourse, if in both instances <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ λέγω</span> has its reference to what immediately precedes—so it is directly opposed by the fact, that the following reply beginning with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῶΤΟς</span></span></span> would not be suitable. For if we were to assume that Paul has given an <span class="ital">indirect</span> answer (“when he shows that the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span> believe, he says: How should not, could not <span class="ital">Israel</span> have believed, if it had willed?” Olsh.), this would only be a makeshift, in which the answer would appear the more unsuitable in proportion to its indirectness, and still leave open the possibility of the <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔγνω</span>. Or if we were to suppose with Rückert, that the thought is: “Want of knowledge is not the cause, but God is now putting into penal execution what He has threatened, and is allowing salvation to pass over to the Gentiles, in order thereby to convert the Jews to a better disposition,” the point of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΓΝΩ</span></span></span> would not be entered into at all, and moreover, the essential part of the interpretation would simply be supplied by the reader. This objection is at the same time valid against van Hengel, according to whom it is to be made to appear from the following prophetic quotations that Israel had indeed known, but had shamefully despised, the gospel. Or if, finally, with Philippi, we are to say that the passages from the prophets contained not a refutation, but a <span class="ital">substantiation</span>, of the fact that verily <span class="ital">Israel</span> had rejected the gospel (which rejection lies in <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔγνω</span>), this would be inconsistent with the interrogative form with <span class="greekheb">μή</span> (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)">Romans 3:5</a>), which necessarily presupposes the <span class="ital">denial</span> of the <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔγνω</span> (consequently the affirmative: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΓΝΩ</span></span></span>). In entire deviation from the views just given, Reiche thinks that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἸΣΡΑΉΛ</span></span></span> is <span class="ital">accusative</span>, and <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span> to be supplied as subject. “Did not God recognise Israel for His people?

Above all nations Israel ought to have understood a message from God: Israel, and inability to understand God’s Word, ought to be incompatible ideas. <span class="greekheb">πρῶτος Μωυσῆς λέγει</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm" title="They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">πρῶτος</span> suggests the beginning of a line of witnesses to this effect: virtually it means, even Moses, at the very beginning of their history. The point of the citation is not very clear. Like the passages quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-25.htm" title="As he said also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved....">Romans 9:25-26</a>, it might have been adduced by Paul as a proof that the Gentiles were to be called into God’s kingdom, and called in order to rouse the Jews to jealousy; but to be in place here, there must be also the latent idea that if peoples beyond the covenant (who were not peoples at all), and unintelligent peoples (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, idol worshippers) could understand the Gospel, a privileged and religiously gifted people like the Jews was surely inexcusable if it failed to understand it. The same idea seems to be enforced again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-20.htm" title="But Esaias is very bold, and said, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not after me.">Romans 10:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡσαίας δὲ ἀποτολμᾷ</span>: “breaks out boldly” (Gifford). It was an act of great daring to speak thus to a nation with the exclusive temper of Israel, and Paul who needed the same courage in carrying the Gospel to the Gentiles was the man to see this. <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐμὲ μὴ ἐπερωτῶντες</span> means those who put no question to me, <span class="ital">sc.</span>, about the way of salvation. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-1.htm" title="I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.">Isaiah 65:1</a> the clauses occur in reverse order. What the prophet has in view is God’s spontaneous unmerited goodness, which takes the initiative, unsolicited, in showing mercy to faithless Jews who made no appeal to Him and never sought Him; the Apostle applies this, like the similar passages in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-25.htm" title="As he said also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.">Romans 9:25</a> f., to the reception of the Gospel by the Gentiles.[2] If God was found and recognised in His character and purposes, where all the conditions seemed so much against it, surely Israel must be inexcusable if it has missed the meaning of the Gospel. The very calling of the Gentiles, predicted and interpreted as it is in the passages quoted, should itself have been a message to the Jews, which they could not misunderstand; it should have opened their eyes as with a lightning flash to the position in which they stood—that of men who had forfeited their place among the people of God—and provoked them, out of jealousy, to vie with these outsiders in welcoming the righteousness of faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2] The part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-1.htm" title="I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.">Isaiah 65:1</a> which is not quoted here (I said, Behold Me, behold Me, unto a nation that was not called by My name) is meant, as usually pointed, to refer to the Gentiles, and this tradition of its application Paul may have learned from Gamaliel (Cheyne); but the pointing is wrong: <span class="ital">see</span> Cheyne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">But I say</span>, &c.] Another objection is anticipated and met, (as indeed it has been already met, less explicitly,) viz., that Israel had no <span class="ital">prophetic warning</span> of the Gentiles’ enlightenment and their own unbelief.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">know?</span>] i.e. “know the prospect” of the spread of Messiah’s Gospel, and their own rejection of it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Moses saith</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm" title="They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>; verbatim with LXX. and Heb., except that “<span class="ital">you</span>” is substituted for “<span class="ital">them</span>,” probably to make the reference unmistakable. The words occur in the sublime prophetic Song of Moses, so full of the mysterious future of both judgment and mercy for Israel. The point of the sentence (see the whole of the verse in Deut.) clearly is that the God of Israel would <span class="ital">adopt other nations</span> as Israel had adopted other gods.—The clause is more strictly rendered <span class="bld">Moses is the first to say</span>.

It may be observed that in the Greek we have the same word, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>,, in both classes of the sentence, though, in order to bring out the supposed meaning in the first clause, it is there, in the Authorized Version, rendered "people," and in the second, "nation." The passage occurs in the song attributed to Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>, and expresses the idea of God, in consequence of the defaults of Israel, favouring those who were so far, as it were, no nation at all, so as to provoke Israel to jealousy. It is therefore aptly cited as an intimation in the Pentateuch itself of the calling of the Gentiles in place of unbelieving Israel. The idea involved in "provoke you to jealousy" - in the sense of moving to emulation, so that Israel itself as a nation might, through the calling of the Gentiles, in the end be saved - is pursued, as will be seen, in the chapter that follows. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Did Israel not know?<p>As in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-18.htm">Romans 10:18</a>, a negative answer is implied. "It is surely not true that Israel did not know." Did not know what? That the Gospel should go forth into all the earth. Moses and Isaiah had prophesied the conversion of the Gentiles, and Isaiah the opposition of the Jews thereto.<p>First Moses<p>First in order; the first who wrote.<p>I will provoke you to jealousy (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>From <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>.

The relation expressed by the preposition is that of the no-people as forming the basis of the jealousy. The prediction is that Israel shall be conquered by an apparently inferior people. No-people as related to God's heritage, not that the Gentiles were inferior or insignificant in themselves. For people render nation, as Rev.
