It referred to that very law which the Apostle is depreciating. Moses had described the <span class= "ital">Law</span> as something quite easy and accessible; but history had shown that, especially in the development in which the Law was known to the Apostle, the words were really much more applicable to his doctrine of a righteousness which was based upon faith. He therefore regards them as spoken allegorically and typically with reference to this.<p><span class= "bld">The righteousness which is of faith speaketh.</span>—This faith-righteousness is personified as if it were speaking itself, because the language used is applicable to it.<p><span class= "bld">That is, to bring Christ down from above.</span>—The Apostle adds these interpretations so as to give a specially Christian meaning to the words of Moses. All that these had meant was that the Law was not remote either in one direction or in another. The Apostle in the phrase “ascend into heaven” sees at once an allusion to the ascended Saviour, and he interprets it as if it implied that the Christian must ascend up to Him, or; what comes to the same thing, as if He must be brought down to the Christian. In like manner, when mention is made of descending into the abyss, he sees here an allusion to the descent of Christ into Hades. Again, he repudiates the idea that the Christian is compelled to join Him there in literal bodily presence. A far easier and simpler thing is the faith of the gospel. All the Christian has to do is to listen to it when it is preached, and then to confess his own adhesion to it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?

When we speak of looking upon Christ, and receiving, and feeding upon him, it is not Christ in heaven, nor Christ in the deep, that we mean; but Christ in the promise, Christ offered in the word. Justification by faith in Christ is a plain doctrine. It is brought before the mind and heart of every one, thus leaving him without excuse for unbelief. If a man confessed faith in Jesus, as the Lord and Saviour of lost sinners, and really believed in his heart that God had raised him from the dead, thus showing that he had accepted the atonement, he should be saved by the righteousness of Christ, imputed to him through faith. But no faith is justifying which is not powerful in sanctifying the heart, and regulating all its affections by the love of Christ. We must devote and give up to God our souls and our bodies: our souls in believing with the heart, and our bodies in confessing with the mouth. The believer shall never have cause to repent his confident trust in the Lord Jesus. Of such faith no sinner shall be ashamed before God; and he ought to glory in it before men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the righteousness which is of faith - It is observable here that Paul does not affirm that Moses describes any where the righteousness by faith, or the effect of the scheme of justification by faith. His object was different, to give the Law, and state its demands and rewards. Yet though he had not formally described the plan of justification by faith, yet he had used language which would fitly express that plan. The scheme of justification by faith is here personified, as if it were living and describing its own effects and nature. One describing it would say, Or the plan itself speaks in this manner. The words here quoted are taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</a>. The original meaning of the passage is this: Moses, near the end of his life, having given his commandments to the Israelites exhorts them to obedience. To do this, he assures them that his commands are reasonable, plain, intelligible, and accessible.<p>They did not require deep research, long journeys, or painful toil. There was no need of crossing seas, and going to other lands, of looking into the profound mysteries of the high heavens, or the deep abyss; but they were near them, had been plainly set before them, and were easily understood. To see the excellency of this characteristic of the divine Law, it may be observed, that among the ancients, it was not uncommon for legislators and philosophers to travel to distant countries in pursuit of knowledge. They left their country, encountered dangers on the sea and land, to go to distant regions that had the reputation of wisdom. Egypt was especially a land of such celebrity; and in subsequent times Pythagoras, and the principal philosophers of Greece, traveled into that country to converse with their priests, and to bear the fruits of their wisdom to benefit their native land. And it is not improbable that this had been done to some extent even in or before the time of Moses. Moses says that his precepts were to be obtained by no such painful and dangerous journeys. They were near them, plain, and intelligible. This is the general meaning of this passage Moses dwells on the thought, and places it in a variety of forms by the questions, "who shall go up to heaven for us, etc.;" and Paul regards this as appropriately describing the language of Christian faith; but without affirming that Moses himself had any reference in the passage to the faith of the gospel.<p>On this wise - In this manner.<p>Say not in thine heart - The expression to say in the heart is the same as to think. Do not think, or suppose, that the doctrine is so difficult to be understood, that one must ascend to heaven in order to understand it.<p>Who shall ascend into heaven? - This expression was used among the Jews to denote any difficult undertaking. To say that it was high as heaven, or that it was necessary to ascend to heaven to understand it, was to express the highest difficulty. Thus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>, "Canst thou by searching find out God? It is high as heaven, what canst thou do? etc." Moses says it was not so with his doctrine. It was not impossible to be understood, but was plain and intelligible.<p>That is, to bring Christ ... - Paul does not here affirm that it was the original design of Moses to affirm this of Christ. His words related to his own doctrine. Paul makes this use of the words because,<p>(1) They appropriately expressed the language of faith.<p>(2) if this might be affirmed of the doctrines of Moses, much more might it of the Christian religion. Religion had no such difficult work to do as to ascend to heaven to bring down a Messiah. That work was already accomplished when God gave his Son to become a man, and to die.<p>To save man it was indeed indispensable that Christ should have come down from heaven. But the language of faith was that this had already been done. Probably the word "Christ" here includes all the benefits mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm">Romans 10:4</a> as resulting from the work of Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

These words are taken out of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-12.htm" title="It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it?">Deu 30:12</a>,13</span>. The question is, Whether Paul doth properly allege this place in Deuteronemy, or only allude to it? Some think the latter, that Moses directly speaks of the law, and that the apostle, by an allusion, or by way of accommodation, applies it unto faith; hence it is, that he doth not cite the very words of Moses, but alters and adds to them, as best served his purpose. But others think, that this would extenuate the torce of St. Paul’s argument, if he should only allude unto this testimony of Moses, and not confirm that which he intended by the same. Therefore their opinion is, that these words are properly cited; and that Moses himself, in that place, doth speak (though very obscurely) of the righteousness of faith; yea, the foregoing words in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-12.htm" title="It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it?">Deu 30:12</a>,13</span> do belong to the times of the gospel. Some of the Jewish rabbis have confessed, that Moses in that chapter, especially the beginning of it, hath reference to the days of the Messiah. He speaks there of the Israelites being driven among all nations, and unto the utmost parts of heaven, which chiefly happened to them a little after the ascension of Christ, and will abide upon them till their conversion, of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-1.htm" title="I say then, Has God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin....">Romans 11:1-36</a></span>; and then God will restore them again to the Land of Promise, to that Jerusalem which is from above, the true church of Jesus Christ; then he will circumcise their hearts, and the hearts of their seed, to love the Lord with all their heart, and with all their soul; then will the Lord rejoice over them to do them good, as he rejoiced over their fathers; then, according to God’s covenant promise, the law of God shall be written in their hearts; it shall not be hidden, or afar off, but nigh them, in their mouths, and in their hearts. Thus the apostle convinceth the Jews by a testimony out of Moses, in whom they trusted. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Say not in thine heart; </span> i.e. think not anxiously and despondingly within thyself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who shall ascend into heaven?</span> i.e. to learn the will of God there concerning our righteousness and salvation, and then teach it to us; or, to see if there be any admission or room for such as I am there, and to carry me thither. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That is, to bring Christ down from above; </span> this is in effect to deny that Christ has already come down from heaven to reveal it to us; and that he must now come to do it: or else, this is as much as to deny that Christ hath already descended from heaven, to procure and purchase salvation for us; and that he must come down again for that purpose. It were to deny the ascension of Christ into heaven; for he is gone thither, not as a private, but as a public person: he is gone thither as our Head, and thither he will bring all his members; he is there as our forerunner, as one that is gone before to prepare a place for us. For Christians to distrust their going to heaven, is to doubt whether Christ be in heaven; he had never gone thither if he had not perfected our redemption and salvation here. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the righteousness which is of faith,.... Or "with respect to the righteousness of faith"; the other righteousness before called the righteousness of God, because God is the author of it, here the righteousness of faith, because that receives it, <p>speaketh on this wise; the selfsame writer who describes the righteousness of the law in such a manner, that it gives no room to a fallen creature ever to expect life and salvation by it, gives such an account of the righteousness of faith, as forbids all doubting and despair: <p>say not in thine heart; let not such a thought enter into thy mind, much less express it with thy lips; <p>who shall ascend into heaven (that is, to bring Christ down from above, or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead). These words are not properly a citation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-12.htm">Deuteronomy 30:12</a>; but the apostle makes use of some phrases which are there, with his own explications of them; though the difference between them, stripped, of these explications is not very material: in the first clause, "who shall ascend into heaven?" the apostle leaves out the phrase, "for us"; which as to the sense was not absolutely necessary to retain; the difficulty, indeed, seems greater in the latter clause, "who shall descend into the deep?" which in the text of Moses is, "who shall go over the sea for us?" but when it is considered that the sea is often called the deep, and that sailing on it and over it, is expressed by "going down to the sea in ships", <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>; and moreover, when it is observed that the Jerusalem Targum paraphrases it thus, <p>"the law is not in heaven that it should be said, oh that we had one of us, as Moses the prophet, who could go up to heaven and bring it to us! nor is it beyond the great sea, that it should be said, oh that we had one of us, as Jonah the prophet   , "who could descend into the depths of the great sea", and bring it to us;'' <p>the apostle is to be justified in his expressions. His sense, indeed, may seem to be different from that of Moses, and of the common interpretations of the Jewish writers, as in the above paraphrase and in the following account of them from the Talmud, understanding them of the law (w); <p>"says Abdimo bar Chama bar Dousa, what is the meaning of that Scripture, "neither is it in heaven, nor is it beyond the sea?" it is not in heaven, for if it was in heaven you must needs go up after it, and if it was beyond the sea, you must needs go over after it; Rabba says, not in heaven is it, you will not find it in him that exalts his knowledge in himself as the heavens, nor will you find it in him that enlarges his knowledge in himself, as the sea; R. Jochanan says, not in heaven is it, you will not find it in those that are of a haughty spirit, nor beyond the sea is it, you will not find it among traders abroad, or merchants.'' <p>Though the apostle's sense may be brought pretty near to this, after this manner; who shall go up to heaven, or down to the deep, either to bring us the knowledge of the law, and yield an obedience to it which that requires of us, or to give us a full account of the Gospel of the grace of God? there is no room, nor reason, for men to say this in their hearts, or to make a doubt of them, as if they were not done already; to do so, is to deny that Christ is come in the flesh, and risen from the dead, who has given the true sense and knowledge of the law, and has perfectly fulfilled it, in the room and stead of his people, and by whom the doctrine of grace and truth is come, particularly the doctrine of a sinner's justification before God; this is brought nigh in the ministration of the word, so that there is no need of such inquiries as these. Moreover, for the illustration of these words, let it be observed, that these phrases are proverbial, and often used to express things impossible, of which take the following instances; <p>"it is a tradition of the Rabbins (x) if a man says to his wife, lo, this is thy divorce, on condition that "thou ascendest to the firmament", on condition that "thou descendest into the deep"; on condition that thou passest over the great sea on foot, this is no divorce;'' <p>the reason is, , "because it is impossible". Again (y), <p>"if a man says to a woman, if thou wilt "ascend into the firmament", or if thou wilt "descend into the deep", lo, thou art espoused to me by this penny; but if thou wilt not go up into the firmament, nor go down into the deep, thou shalt not be espoused; and after that he puts the penny into her hand, lo, the condition becomes void, and behold she is espoused immediately, for the thing is known , "that it is impossible" for her to fulfil the condition.'' <p>So here are forbidden all such thoughts, words, or expressions which carry such a sense as this; who will go down to the deep to fetch such a wretch as I am out of the lowest hell, to deliver me from the curses of the law, and the wrath of God, and bring me out of this wretched miserable condition in which I am? or go up to heaven and carry me there, and put me in the possession of the undefiled inheritance? all this is as impossible to be done, as for a man to ascend to heaven, or go down into the deep: now though the righteousness of the law encourages such despondency and black despair, the righteousness of faith, or the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ's righteousness, forbids every thing of this kind; assuring the sinner, that Christ is come down from heaven in human nature, that he has fulfilled all the righteousness of the law by his obedience in life, and has bore the penalty of it in his sufferings and death, and is risen again for justification; so that such questions should not be put, nor such despairing thoughts encouraged: besides, to think and speak in this manner, is to set aside the whole scheme of the Gospel, and supposes the person to doubt whether Christ is come down from heaven; and therefore asks, who shall go up to bring him down? and that he is not risen from the dead; and therefore puts the question, who will go down to the deep to fetch him up? whereas he is already come, has obeyed, suffered, and died, and rose again, and is become the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believes. <p>(w) T.

An increasing animation, and indeed triumphant tone in the representation, which thus introduces over-against that dark background (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm" title="For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them.">Romans 10:5</a>) the bright picture the more immediately in concrete vividness.

But that Paul actually regarded the words of Moses as a <span class="ital">prophetical testimony</span> to the nature of the righteousness of faith, is an opinion sanctioned only by a minority of expositors (Augustine, <span class="ital">de nat. et grat</span>. 83; Bucer, Balduin, Calovius, Semler, Ch. Schmidt, Reiche, Köllner, Olshausen, Benecke, Fritzsche, Baumgarten-Crusius, Ewald, Umbreit). The majority, on the other hand, assume that Paul <span class="ital">only clothed</span> his own thoughts in the words of Moses, and used the latter <span class="ital">as a suitable substratum for the former</span>. So Tholuck, Flatt, Rückert, Reithmayr, Maier, Philippi: “a holy and charming play of the Spirit of God upon the word of the Lord;” van Hengel and several others, as formerly Chrysostom, Luther, Beza, Calvin, Cornelius a Lapide; Bengel: “suavissima parodia.” But against this view is the fact that <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm" title="For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them.">Romans 10:5</a> begins with <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> a demonstration of the <span class="greekheb">τέλος νόμου Χριστός</span>, of which <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm" title="For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them.">Romans 10:5</a> contains only the one, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?

(that is, to bring Christ down from above:)">Romans 10:6</a> is no valid argument against our view. This applies likewise against Hofmann, according to whom that, which the righteousness of faith speaks, is intended to <span class="ital">recall</span> Deut. <span class="ital">l.c</span>.; in such a way, however, that the word of which Moses speaks is related to that which the righteousness of faith means, as the O. T. to the N. T., and thus the former is a prediction of the latter. Groundless is the further objection, that Paul nowhere else thus mixes up a biblical passage with comments. For we are acquainted with comments in the style of the Midrash in Paul’s writings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-8.htm" title="That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.">Romans 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-23.htm" title="But he who was of the female slave was born after the flesh; but he of the free woman was by promise....">Galatians 4:23-24</a>); and that they are here <span class="ital">interspersed</span> is unessential, and was very naturally suggested by the opposed <span class="greekheb">ἀναβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐρανόν</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΒ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΕἸς Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἌΒΥΣΣΟΝ</span></span></span>. In conclusion, we must further observe that, if Paul had given the biblical words only as the clothing of his own representation, yet we should have to assume, and that for the very sake of the <span class="ital">honesty</span> of the apostle (which Philippi thinks endangered by our view), that he actually found in the saying the typical reference to the righteousness of faith; even the holy “<span class="ital">play</span>” upon words of the Spirit can be no erroneous play. Theodoret took the right view: <span class="greekheb">διδάσκει πάλιν νόμου καὶ χάριτος τὴν διαφορὰν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀμφοτέρων εἰσάγει Μωϋσέα τὸν νομοθέτην διδάσκαλον</span>.

Moses has there said of the <span class="ital">commandment</span> of God to Israel to fulfil His law (for the passage speaks of nothing else according to its historical sense) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-11.htm" title="For the scripture said, Whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 10:11</a>, that this commandment does not transcend the sphere of what is capable of accomplishment, nor does it lie at strange distance; and he then adds, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-12.htm" title="For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich to all that call on him.">Romans 10:12</a> ff., in order more precisely to depict this thought: <span class="ital">It is neither in heaven nor beyond the sea, so that one must first ascend to the former or sail over the latter</span> (comp. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/baruch/3-29.htm" title="Who hath gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought her down from the clouds?...">Bar 3:29-30</a>) <span class="ital">to fetch it, that one may hear and do it; rather is it quite near, in the mouth and in the heart</span> (<span class="ital">and in the hands</span>, an addition of LXX., and in Philo); that is, the people itself carries it in its mouth, and it is stamped upon its heart, <span class="ital">in order that they may accomplish it</span> (לַעֲשֹתו<span class="greekheb">̇</span>). <span class="ital">Paul</span> finds here a type, and therewith an indirect prophecy, of the demand which the righteousness <span class="ital">of faith</span> presents, entirely different from that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΙΕῖΝ</span></span></span> which is demanded by the righteousness <span class="ital">of the law, inasmuch as the righteousness of faith forbids only unbelief in reference to Christ, as though He had not come from heaven, or had not risen from the dead, and directs men, on the other hand, to the word of faith, which, through its preachers, is laid in their mouth and heart</span>. The sum and substance of this typically prophetic sense is therefore: “<span class="ital">Be not unbelieving, but believing;</span>” and here the grand historical points, to which faith as well as unbelief relate, could not be brought into relief more definitely and significantly than by means of the <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸν καταγαγεῖν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀναγαγεῖν</span> (in opposition to Tholuck’s objection). According to Fritzsche (comp. Calovius), the sense meant is: no one can become righteous <span class="ital">through works</span>, “<span class="ital">faciendo et moliendo</span>,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?

But in this case, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)...">Romans 10:6-7</a> would surely be a warning from the mouth of the righteousness of faith against a <span class="ital">facere et moliri</span>, which would be of <span class="ital">quite another kind</span> than that of the righteousness of the law, and which even would have included <span class="ital">in abstracto</span>, as a <span class="ital">presupposition</span>, this very faith in the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Christ. Still less can we, with Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Grotius, and several others (comp. also Reithmayr, Philippi, and Krummacher), find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?

For against this view is the fact, in the first place, that in what Paul subjoins, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-9.htm" title="That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.">Romans 10:9</a> ff., nothing at all is said of difficulty and facility; secondly—and this is decisive—the fact that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-5.htm" title="For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them....">Romans 10:5-8</a> is to be a <span class="ital">proof</span> founded on Moses of the statement, <span class="greekheb">τέλος νόμου Χριστός</span>; but it is evident, that not from the <span class="ital">facility</span> of the Christian <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>, but from its <span class="ital">being essentially different from the old</span> (the latter resting on <span class="ital">doing</span>, the former on <span class="ital">faith</span>), it follows that with Christ, the Mediator of the new <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>, the <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> must have reached its end. This, too, in reply to Knapp, <span class="ital">Scr. var. arg</span>. II. p. 558 f., who, besides the erroneous point of view of difficulty and facility, reads otherwise between the lines the most essential points of his interpretation. See, on the other hand, van Hengel, who, however, on his side assumes that Paul desired “<span class="ital">avocare</span>” unsettled Jewish Christians “<span class="ital">a salutis duce longe quaerendo, quum quisque, qui Christi communione utatur, per fidem in Deo positam possideat, quod, ut ex legis alicujus observatione, sic etiam aliunde afferri non possit</span>.” The connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a> likewise tells against this view, as does also the circumstance that, if only the <span class="ital">longe quaerere</span> were the conception presented, it would not be easy to see why Paul should have inserted at all his explanations <span class="greekheb">τοῦτʼ ἔστι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and why he should not have retained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm" title="Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)">Romans 10:7</a> the words of the LXX.: <span class="greekheb">τίς διαπεράσει ἡμῖν εἰς τὸ πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μὴ εἴπης ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καρδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σου</span>] LXX.: <span class="greekheb">λέγων</span>, Heb. <span class="greekheb">לֵאמֹר</span>, wherein, according to the connection (“It is not in heaven that one might speak,” etc.), the forbidding sense <span class="ital">indirectly</span> lies. This Paul expresses <span class="ital">directly</span>, because his quotation is severed from the connection of the original; and he adds <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καρδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σου</span>, because unbelief has its seat <span class="ital">in the heart</span>, and the expression “<span class="ital">to speak in the heart</span>” (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm" title="The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that does good.">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-7.htm" title="How much she has glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she said in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.">Revelation 18:7</a>) was very current in the mention of unholy thoughts and dispositions (Surenhusius, <span class="greekheb">καταλλ</span>., p. 479.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τίς ἀναβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐρ</span>.] <span class="ital">Who will ascend into heaven?</span> In the sense of the apostle, the inquiry is one not expressive of a wish (“utinam quis sit, qui nos e longinquo in viam salutis ducat,” van Hengel), nor yet of <span class="ital">despair</span>, but—correlative of that <span class="greekheb">τῷ πιστεύοντι</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>, and opposed to the <span class="greekheb">ὁ ποιήσας</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm" title="For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them.">Romans 10:5</a>—the inquiry of <span class="ital">unbelief</span>, which holds the appearance of Christ from heaven, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> His <span class="ital">incarnation, as not having taken place</span>, and <span class="ital">as an impossibility</span>. Therefore Paul adds the Midrashistic interpretation: <span class="ital">that expresses</span>, that signifies: <span class="ital">in order to bring Christ down</span>—this is the <span class="ital">object</span>, which is implied in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΑΒΉΣΕΤΑΙ ΕἸς Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΟὐΡ</span></span></span>., and by its addition Paul thus contributes a more precise <span class="ital">explanation</span> of the question (<span class="greekheb">τοῦτʼ ἔστι</span>: <span class="ital">scilicet</span>), namely, as respects its <span class="ital">tendency</span>, as respects that at which it aims. Thus more exactly defined, the question would presuppose, that he who puts it does not believe that Christ has come out of the heavenly world and has appeared in the flesh (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>), <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ὉΜΟΙΏΜΑΤΙ ἈΝΘΡΏΠΩΝ</span></span></span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:...">Php 2:6-7</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1 John 4:2</a>). Following Melancthon, Castalio, Calvin, and others, Reiche thinks that unbelief <span class="ital">in regard to the session of Christ on the right hand of God</span> is meant. But if there were here a prohibition of the desire to behold with the eyes this object of faith (Reiche), the second question, which nevertheless is manifestly quite parallel, would be highly inappropriate; for then an existence of Christ in the <span class="greekheb">ἄβυσσος</span> would of necessity be an object of faith, which yet it is not at all. Nor could we see why Paul should have said <span class="greekheb">καταγαγεῖν</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-6.htm" title="But the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)">Romans 10:6</a>, since the matter would in fact turn only on a <span class="ital">seeing</span> of Christ in heaven. Moreover, Paul, considering the freedom with which he handles this passage from Moses, would have <span class="ital">transposed</span> the two questions, in order to avoid the glaring historical <span class="ital">prothysteron</span> which occurs, if the first question refers to the session of Christ at the right hand of God, to which van Hengel also refers it. According to Glöckler, the question, Who will go up into heaven? means to ask, Who will accomplish redemption? for the ascension was a necessary requisite for the Mediator; and therefore <span class="greekheb">τοῦτʼ ἔστι</span> signifies: this would mean <span class="ital">to deny the ascension of Christ</span>. Consistently, Glöckler then understands the second question as, Who will (voluntarily) go into death? this would mean to <span class="ital">deny the death of Christ</span>. But by this necessarily consistent view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm" title="Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)">Romans 10:7</a> the whole exposition is overthrown. For <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-9.htm" title="That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.">Romans 10:9</a> proves that <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm" title="Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)">Romans 10:7</a> refers to the <span class="ital">resurrection</span> of Christ; nor did unbelief, in truth, <span class="ital">deny</span> the death of Christ, but took offence at it. Like Glöckler, Lipsius, <span class="ital">Rechtfertigungsl</span>. p. 102 f., has essentially misunderstood both verses, and Rückert the question of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm" title="Or, Who shall descend into the deep?

The LXX., following the original, has: <span class="greekheb">τίς διαπεράσει ἡμῖν εἰς τὸ πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης</span>; But <span class="ital">Paul</span>, in his typical reference to Christ, had sufficient cause and liberty, from the standpoint of the historical fulfilment, to put expressly, instead of <span class="greekheb">πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης</span>, even without reflecting that the springs of the sea lie in the lowest depth of the earth (see Ewald, <span class="ital">Jahrb</span>.

It is the righteousness of faith itself which speaks, describing its own character and accessibility in words with a fine flavour of inspiration about them. But it is not so much a quotation we find here, as a free reproduction and still freer application of a very familiar passage of the O.T. It is irrelevant to point out that what the writer in Deuteronomy means is that the law (<span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐντολὴ αὔτη ἢν ἐγὼ ἐντέλλομαί σοι σήμερον</span>) is not oppressive nor impracticable (as Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm" title="For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them.">Romans 10:5</a> tacitly assumes it to be); the Apostle is not thinking in the least what the writer of Deuteronomy meant; as the representative of the righteousness of faith, he is putting his own thoughts—his inspired conviction and experience of the Gospel—into a free reproduction of these ancient inspired words. <span class="greekheb">μὴ εἴπῃς ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου</span>: = do not think, especially thoughts you would be ashamed to utter. <span class="greekheb">τίς ἀναβήσεται εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν</span>; … <span class="greekheb">ἢ τίς καταβήσεται εἰς τὴν ἄβυσσον</span>; There is no impossible preliminary to be accomplished before the true religion is got under way; we have neither to scale heaven nor descend into the abyss. <span class="greekheb">ἄβυσσος</span> (in N.T.) only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-31.htm" title="And they sought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep.">Luke 8:31</a> and seven times in Rev. But <span class="ital">cf.</span> Ps. 106:26; 70:20. The passage in Deuteronomy has <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης</span>.

The first means (in his mind) bringing Christ down; the second, bringing Christ up from the dead. Evidently the righteousness of faith is concerned with a Christ of whom both these things are true—a descent from heaven, and a rising from the dead, Incarnation and Resurrection. We could not bring about either by any effort, but we do not need to; Christ incarnate and risen is here already, God’s gift to faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh</span>] The “righteousness of faith” is here equivalent to “the righteousness of God.” <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-11.htm" title="Your lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under your tongue; and the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-13.htm" title="Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,">Song of Solomon 4:13</a>.—Here, by a striking personification, not unlike that of the Divine Wisdom in the Proverbs, Justification is said to speak, in the words of Deuteronomy. In St Paul’s view “the Word of God” indeed “<span class="ital">liveth</span>,” with a life which gives an almost personality to its doctrines.—Perhaps he avoids the phrase “<span class="ital">Moses</span> speaketh” because the terms of the <span class="ital">legal</span> covenant have just been quoted as uttered by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm" title="For Moses describes the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which does those things shall live by them.">Romans 10:5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Say not in thine heart</span>] The original of the quotations here is <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/30-12.htm" title="It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it, and do it?...">Deuteronomy 30:12-14</a>. The form of the quotation is free; but nevertheless St Paul really employs the passage as a proof, and does not merely adapt it to his purpose. For the very point of his argument just here is that, <span class="ital">in and by the Law</span>, Christ is suggested and announced; and if he merely adapted Mosaic words to express his own thought, this point would be missed. Alford has some admirable remarks on the passage: he argues that the practical import of the passage in Deuteronomy is that the Law, as the Revelation of God’s will, is not an unintelligible mystery to man, but a thing that can be known and loved; but that, if so, then <span class="ital">à fortiori</span> this is true “of Him who is the end of the law, and of the commandment to believe in Him, which (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1 John 3:23</a>) is now <span class="ital">God’s commandment</span>.”—St Paul assumes that the O.

The word is very near to thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart and in thy hands to do it.” This paraphrase, so to speak, very sweetly alludes to this passage, without expressly quoting it. Moses speaks of heaven, as well as Paul, but the former afterwards says, <span class="ital">across the sea</span>, instead of which Paul most dexterously turns his discourse to <span class="ital">the abyss</span>, that he may on the contrary [in antithesis to their question as to the abyss] make mention of the resurrection of Christ from the dead. The abyss is a huge cavity in the terraqueous globe, at once under the sea and the land.

For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation</span>. The apostle's purpose in varying from the original is obvious from his interposed comments, and from the application that follows. It seems to be as though he had said, "See how, with a slight alteration, the passage in Deuteronomy becomes an exact description of our Christian doctrine." The most marked alteration is the substitution of "into the deep" for "beyond the sea." The "sea" in the original, to which the term "abyss" is applicable (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-14.htm">Job 28:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-26.htm">Psalm 107:26</a>), may have suggested the word; but St. Paul here evidently means by it the regions of the dead, imagined as subterranean, equivalent to the Hebrew <span class="accented">Sheol</span>, and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f0d;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. For use of the word in this sense, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/71-20.htm">Psalm 71:20</a> (which may have been present to his mind), <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-31.htm">Luke 8:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm">Revelation 9:1, 2, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-7.htm">Revelation 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm">Revelation 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1, 3</a>; in which passages <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> seems to denote the penal abode, corresponding to the Greek idea of Tartarus; but the word itself does not contain this idea, which is by no means intimated here. It may be taken to denote <span class="accented">Hades</span>, into which Christ "descended." Some commentators suppose the previous expression, "ascend into heaven to bring Christ down," to mean bringing him back to earth from heaven, whither he has ascended now. But the mere fact of its coming first, as well as the general sense of the passage, shows it to refer rather to the Incarnation, and what follows to the Resurrection. These were the two grand stages in the great work of redemption; both were required that "the righteousness which is of faith" might effectually be brought "nigh unto us." The impossible task of effecting either was not required of man; God has done both for us, and we have but to "believe in our hearts," that "the word" of his grace may be nigh us, in our mouth and in our heart, that we may do it. Thus all that was intimated or foreshadowed by that old passage in Deuteronomy is in its fullest sense to us fulfilled. (It may be observed, in passing, that the application to the Incarnation of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, etc., is, if correct, one of the instances of St. Paul's recognition of the Divine pre-existence of our Lord.) In ver. 9 the applicability of the words, "in thy mouth, and in thine heart," to the gospel dispensation is shown; the two expressions, properly understood, denoting all that is required of us. Confession of the Lord Jesus with the mouth must be taken to express generally, not only fearless avowal of the Christian faith, but also consistent life, according to the full meaning of our Lord's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-32.htm">Matthew 10:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-26.htm">Luke 10:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-8.htm">Luke 12:8</a>, etc. Confession of the Lord Jesus with the mouth, too, would have a peculiar significance then, when Christians were often so sorely tempted to deny him under persecution (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>). We may observe also how "the mouth" is elsewhere regarded as the index of the heart; as the main bodily organ whereby character is evinced and expressed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34, 37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-11.htm">Matthew 15:11</a>, etc.). Further, the belief spoken of is <span class="accented">belief in the heart -</span> a living operative faith, not intellectual conviction only. Nor is belief that God raised the Lord Jesus from the dead to be taken as meaning belief of this one article of the Creed alone; it carries with it belief in the gospel generally, the doctrine of the Resurrection being here, as elsewhere, regarded as the central doctrine on which all the rest depends (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-17.htm">1 Corinthians 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>). "Haec summa Evangelii est. Nam, cum credimus Christum excitatum esse e mortuis, credimus sum pro peccatis satisfecisse, et in coelis regnare, ut nos ad imaginem suam perficiat" (Bucer). In ver. 10, where the offices of the heart and of the mouth are denoted in general terms, the distinction between "unto righteousness" with respect to the one, and "unto salvation" with respect to the other, is significant. By faith alone we are justified; but by confession in actual life, which is the fruit of faith, our salvation is secured. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The righteousness which is of faith (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;).<p>The of-faith righteousness.

Paul recognizes a secondary meaning in Moses' words, and thus changes the original expressions so as to apply them to the Christian faith-system. His object in the change is indicated by the explanatory words which he adds. He does not formally declare that Moses describes the righteousness of faith in these words, but appropriates the words of Moses, putting them into the mouth of the personified faith-righteousness.<p>Say not in thy heart<p>In thy heart is added by Paul.
