The Apostle glances back for a moment over the course of his argument.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good....">Romans 7:12-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— Since then, by what has been said, it appears that the law is not the cause of sin or death, except indirectly and by accident, it must be acquitted from this charge, and acknowledged to be <span class="ital">holy; and the commandment </span>— The preceptive part of the moral law, and every particular precept of it; <span class="ital">is holy, just, and good </span>— It springs from and partakes of the holy nature of God; tends only to promote holiness and a conformity to God, and prescribes our duty to God in his worship and service. It is every way <span class="ital">just </span>and right in itself, and commands nothing but what is agreeable to those common apprehensions of right and equity which are imprinted in our natures: it is designed wholly for the <span class="ital">good </span>of man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-8.htm" title="But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;">1 Timothy 1:8</a>, and is really profitable and conducive to our good, both temporal and eternal, and subservient to the common interest of mankind. <span class="ital">Was then that which is good made </span>the cause of evil to me? — Yea, of <span class="ital">death, </span>which is the greatest of evils? Was it made the proper and direct cause of death? Not so: <span class="ital">But </span>it was <span class="ital">sin, </span>which was made death to me, inasmuch as it wrought death in me, even by that which is good. Here the apostle clearly distinguishes between a proper <span class="ital">cause </span>and an <span class="ital">occasion, </span>or cause by accident. The law is the occasion of death to sinners; but sin is the proper or efficient cause of that evil. <span class="ital">That it might appear sin — </span>Might appear superlatively vile; <span class="ital">working death in me by that which is good </span>— By the good law: <span class="ital">that sin by the commandment </span>— Manifesting and forbidding it, and thereby awakening and irritating it; <span class="ital">might become exceeding sinful</span> — That, being quickened and excited by so innocent and holy a thing as the commandment, it might thereby show its horrid and vile nature; the guilt of it being hereby greatly aggravated. “Our translators suppose that <span class="greekheb">αμαρτωλος </span>[rendered <span class="ital">sinful</span>] is put here for the adjective. But, as Beza observes, it is used as a substantive, and signifies <span class="ital">a sinner. </span>For the apostle carries on the personification of sin, begun chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>, by showing its exceeding sinfulness in this respect, that it makes the law, which was intended for life, the occasion of men’s death.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:7-13 There is no way of coming to that knowledge of sin, which is necessary to repentance, and therefore to peace and pardon, but by trying our hearts and lives by the law. In his own case the apostle would not have known the sinfulness of his thoughts, motives, and actions, but by the law. That perfect standard showed how wrong his heart and life were, proving his sins to be more numerous than he had before thought, but it did not contain any provision of mercy or grace for his relief. He is ignorant of human nature and the perverseness of his own heart, who does not perceive in himself a readiness to fancy there is something desirable in what is out of reach. We may perceive this in our children, though self-love makes us blind to it in ourselves. The more humble and spiritual any Christian is, the more clearly will he perceive that the apostle describes the true believer, from his first convictions of sin to his greatest progress in grace, during this present imperfect state. St. Paul was once a Pharisee, ignorant of the spirituality of the law, having some correctness of character, without knowing his inward depravity. When the commandment came to his conscience by the convictions of the Holy Spirit, and he saw what it demanded, he found his sinful mind rise against it. He felt at the same time the evil of sin, his own sinful state, that he was unable to fulfil the law, and was like a criminal when condemned. But though the evil principle in the human heart produces sinful motions, and the more by taking occasion of the commandment; yet the law is holy, and the commandment holy, just, and good. It is not favourable to sin, which it pursues into the heart, and discovers and reproves in the inward motions thereof. Nothing is so good but a corrupt and vicious nature will pervert it. The same heat that softens wax, hardens clay. Food or medicine when taken wrong, may cause death, though its nature is to nourish or to heal. The law may cause death through man's depravity, but sin is the poison that brings death. Not the law, but sin discovered by the law, was made death to the apostle. The ruinous nature of sin, and the sinfulness of the human heart, are here clearly shown.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore - So that. The conclusion to which we come is, that the Law is not to be blamed, though these are its effects under existing circumstances. The source of all this is not the Law, but the corrupt nature of man. The Law is good; and yet the position of the apostle is true, that it is not adapted to purify the heart of fallen man. Its tendency is to excite increased guilt, conflict, alarm, and despair. This verse contains an answer to the question in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7</a>, "Is the law sin?"<p>Is holy - Is not sin; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7</a>. It is pure in its nature.<p>And the commandment - The word "commandment" is here synonymous with the Law. It properly means what is enjoined.<p>Holy - Pure.<p>Just - Righteous in its claims and penalties. It is not unequal in its exactions.<p>Good - In itself good; and in its own nature tending to produce happiness. The sin and condemnation of the guilty is not the fault of the Law. If obeyed, it would produce happiness everywhere.

This is a conclusion or inference drawn from the preceding discourse, in commendation of the law; that standing clear of any charge or imputation of sin, as being the cause of it. This epithet the apostle gives to the law is what the Jews frequently give it; worthy are the Israelites, say they (h), <p>"to whom is given  "the holy law"; in which they study day and night.'' <p>By "the law" is meant the whole body of the precepts of it in general; and by <p>the commandment, either the same, or everyone of the commandments in particular, and especially that which is cited, "thou shall not covet". Some have thought that the three properties of it design the threefold division of the law; and suppose that by that which is "holy" is meant the ceremonial law, which sanctified to the purifying of the flesh; by that which is "just", the judicial law, which pointed out to the Jewish commonwealth what was right and wrong; and by that which is "good", the moral law in all its precepts: but nothing is more certain, than that the moral law is only spoken of in this context, which may be said to be <p>holy, because of its author, the holy God, from whom nothing can come but what is holy; and because of the matter of it, it is a transcript of the holy nature of God, a declaration of his holy will; it requires holiness both of heart and life; it forbids whatever is unholy, and commands nothing but what is holy; it teaches men to live holy, sober, righteous, and godly lives. It may be truly called <p>just, or righteous, as it demands perfect obedience to all its precepts, or it will not admit of it as a righteousness; as it pronounces guilty, curses and condemns for every disobedience of it; as it deals impartially with persons the transgressors of it; and as it acquits believers upon the foot of the righteousness of Christ, the fulfilling end of it. It is rightly called <p>good, from the author of it, God, from whom every good thing comes, and nothing else; from the matter of it, and from the use of it both to saints and sinners. <p>(h) Zohar in Gen. fol. 48. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Wherefore the law <i>is</i> holy, and the <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> commandment holy, and just, and good.</span><p>(6) The conclusion: that the law is holy in itself, and that all the fault is in us, the ones who abuse the law.<p>(t) Concerning the commandment, not to covet.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.">Romans 7:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὥστε</span>] The result of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then?

The question of ver. 7, "Is the Law sin?" has now been answered so far as this - that, far from being so, the commandment was in itself "unto life" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>), only that sin took occasion by it, and so got power to slay.

No, it is replied; away with the thought! Its effect was only to reveal sin in its true light; it was only an Ithuriel's spear ('Par. Lost,' bk. 4.),bringing out and exposing the deadly thing that before was latent. And (as is elsewhere set forth in pursuance of the line of thought) its effect in the end was really "unto life;" for its awakening of the sense of sin, and of a craving for redemption from it, was the necessary preparation for such redemption (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Holy, just, good<p>Holy as God's revelation of Himself; just (Rev., righteous) in its requirements, which correspond to God's holiness; good, salutary, because of its end. </body></html>
