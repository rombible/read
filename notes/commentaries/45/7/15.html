It is therefore used by the apostle to denote the continued employment of God’s people in his service unto the end of their lives; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm" title="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.">Php 2:12</a>, <span class="ital">Work out your own salvation. </span>That is, as you have, in time past, laboured to serve God in all things, so persevere in that service to the end. The word here denotes a continued employment of a very different nature. Therefore he says, What I work, <span class="ital">I allow not, </span>or, <span class="ital">approve not; </span>for the word,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γινωσκω</span>, which literally signifies <span class="ital">I know, is </span>used in the sense of <span class="ital">approving, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-21.htm" title="Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 7:21</a>. <span class="ital">For what I would </span>— That is, <span class="ital">incline to, </span>or <span class="ital">desire, </span>as Macknight renders <span class="greekheb">θελω</span>, which, he observes, cannot here signify the last determination of the will, “actions always following that determination; but such a faint ineffectual desire as reason and conscience, opposed by strong passions, and not strengthened by the Spirit of God, often produce.” These corrupt passions frequently darken the understanding, mislead the judgment, and stupify the conscience; in consequence whereof the will, strongly impelled by criminal desires, in the place of being governed by these higher powers of the mind, governs them herself. But, “when order is restored to the soul by regeneration, then the enlightened understanding determines the judgment, and the decisions thereof, enforced by the voice of conscience, determine the will, whose volitions, thus excited, become the spring of action; so that the good the regenerated man would, he doth, — and the evil he hates, he doth not. But, in the unregenerate, those volitions neither obey the directions of reason nor conscience; hence there is a continual conflict in his breast, between appetites and passions on the one side, and reason and conscience on the other. The latter, however, are generally overcome; and in this state the person, with propriety, may say, <span class="ital">What I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that I do: </span>or, as it is expressed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-19.htm" title="For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.">Romans 7:19</a>, <span class="ital">The good, that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do. </span>Ovid, a heathen, describes the conduct of depraved men in words very similar to these:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Sed trahit invitam nova vis, aliudque cupido, Mens aliud suadet.

A real Christian unwillingly serves this hated master, yet cannot shake off the galling chain, till his powerful and gracious Friend above, rescues him. The remaining evil of his heart is a real and humbling hinderance to his serving God as angels do and the spirits of just made perfect. This strong language was the result of St. Paul's great advance in holiness, and the depth of his self-abasement and hatred of sin. If we do not understand this language, it is because we are so far beneath him in holiness, knowledge of the spirituality of God's law, and the evil of our own hearts, and hatred of moral evil. And many believers have adopted the apostle's language, showing that it is suitable to their deep feelings of abhorrence of sin, and self-abasement. The apostle enlarges on the conflict he daily maintained with the remainder of his original depravity. He was frequently led into tempers, words, or actions, which he did not approve or allow in his renewed judgement and affections. By distinguishing his real self, his spiritual part, from the self, or flesh, in which sin dwelt, and by observing that the evil actions were done, not by him, but by sin dwelling in him, the apostle did not mean that men are not accountable for their sins, but he teaches the evil of their sins, by showing that they are all done against reason and conscience. Sin dwelling in a man, does not prove its ruling, or having dominion over him. If a man dwells in a city, or in a country, still he may not rule there.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For that which I do - That is, the evil which I do, the sin of which I am conscious, and which troubles me.<p>I allow not - I do not approve; I do not wish it; the prevailing bent of my inclinations and purposes is against it. Greek, "I know not;" see the margin. The word "know," however, is sometimes used in the sense of approving, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/2-24.htm">Revelation 2:24</a>, "Which have not known (approved) the depths of Satan;" compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/101-4.htm">Psalm 101:4</a>, I will not know a wicked person." <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>.<p>For what I would - That which I approve; and which is my prevailing and established desire. What I would wish always to do.<p>But what I hate - What I disapprove of: what is contrary to my judgment; my prevailing inclination; my established principles of conduct.<p>That do I-- Under the influence of sinful propensities, and carnal inclinations and desires. This represents the strong native propensity to sin; and even the power of corrupt propensity under the restraining influence of the gospel. On this remarkable and important passage we may observe,<p>(1) That the prevailing propensity; the habitual fixed inclination of the mind of the Christian, is to do right. The evil course is hated, the right course is loved. This is the characteristic of a pious mind. It distinguishes a holy man from a sinner.<p>(2) the evil which is done is disapproved; is a source of grief; and the habitual desire of the mind is to avoid it, and be pure. This also distinguishes the Christian from the sinner.<p>(3) there is no need of being embarrassed here with any metaphysical difficulties or inquiries how this can be; for.<p>(a) it is in fact the experience of all Christians. The habitual, fixed inclination and desire of their minds is to serve God. They have a fixed abhorrence of sin; and yet they are conscious of imperfection, and error, and sin, that is the source of uneasiness and trouble. The strength of natural passion may in an unguarded moment overcome them. The power of long habits of previous thoughts may annoy them. A man who was an infidel before his conversion, and whose mind was filled with scepticism, and cavils, and blasphemy, will find the effect of his former habits of thinking lingering in his mind, and annoying his peace for years. These thoughts will start up with the rapidity of lightning. Thus, it is with every vice and every opinion. It is one of the effects of habit. "The very passage of an impure thought through the mind leaves pollution behind it," and where sin has been long indulged, it leaves its withering, desolating effect on the soul long after conversion, and produces that state of conflict with which every Christian is familiar.<p>(b) An effect somewhat similar is felt by all people. All are conscious of doing that, under the excitement of passion and prejudice, which their conscience and better judgment disapprove. A conflict thus exists, which is attended with as much metaphysical difficulty as the struggle in the Christian's mind referred to here.<p>(c) The same thing was observed and described in the writings of the heathen. Thus, Xenophon (Cyrop. vi. 1), Araspes, the Persian, says, in order to excuse his treasonable designs," Certainly I must have two souls; for plainly it is not one and the same which is both evil and good; and at the same time wishes to do a thing and not to do it. Plainly then, there are two souls; and when the good one prevails, then it does good; and when the evil one predominates, then it does evil." So also Epictetus (Enchixid. ii. 26) says, "He that sins does not do what he would, but what he would not, that he does." With this passage it would almost seem that Paul was familiar, and had his eye on it when he wrote. So also the well-known passage from Ovid, Meta. vii. 9.<p>Aliudque Cupido,<p>Mens aliud suadet.

The apostle having cleared the law from the charge of being the cause either of sin or death, and taken the blame to himself, proceeds to give an account of the struggle and combat he found in himself between the flesh and spirit; "that which I do, I allow not". That which he did was evil, since he allowed not of it; but this is to be understood not of any notorious crime committed by him, and repeated again and again; nor of a sinful course of life, for before his conversion he was not a profane man, but externally moral; and after his conversion, had his conversation in the world by the grace of God in righteousness and holiness; a vicious course of life being contrary to the grace of God implanted in him, and the doctrines of grace professed by him; but of internal lusts, the workings of corruptions in his heart, and which are real actions of the mind, together with the various frailties and infirmities of life: when that apostle says that what he did,  "I know not": his meaning is, not that he was utterly ignorant of them, of their nature and operations; that he was insensible of their motions, and unconcerned about them; for his sense of them, and concern for them, are expressed by him in the strongest terms, "I know", "I find", "I see", "O wretched man", &amp;c. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-18.htm">Romans 7:18</a>; but either that the efforts and effects of sin in him were so sadden, and at an unawares, that he was sometimes overtaken and held captive, before he knew well where he was, or, what he was doing; or the sense is, that he had not a full knowledge of the evil of his heart, the corruptions of his nature, nor did he understand all his infirmities and the errors of his life; or else the meaning is, I own it not as right, but confess it to be wrong, I do not acknowledge these actions as the productions of the new man, they are alien to him, but as the deeds of the old man; or rather, "I do not approve" of them, I dislike, abhor, and detest them; I cannot excuse or palliate them, but must condemn them; so words of knowledge in the Hebrew language are expressive of love, liking, and approbation; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>; on which last text, "I know him", says Jarchi, , "it is the language of love", or a phrase expressive of strong affection; and so here, I know not, I do not like, love, and approve of these things, or I do not "allow" of them, and indulge myself in them, I loathe them and myself for them; and is this talking like an unregenerate man? can it be thought that the apostle speaks of himself as unregenerate, or represents such a man? <p>for what I would, that do I not; what he desired and willed was good, though he did it not; and so the Vulgate Latin version reads, "for not the good which I would, I:do": and so the next clause, "but the evil which I hate, I:do": and what was that? he would have had his thoughts always employed about the best things; he would have had his affections continually and alone set on God, Christ, and the things of another world; he would he was desirous to keep the whole law of God, and do the whole will of God, and live without sin, and as the angels do in heaven: now such a will as this is never to be found in unregenerate persons; this is from God, and the power of his grace: when he says he did not what he willed, what he was desirous of, and bent upon, his sense is, not that he never did any good thing he willed; for he did many good things, as every good man does, but he did not always do the good he willed, and never perfectly, nor anything without grace and strength from Christ: he adds, <p>but what I hate, that do I; sin was what he hated; it being contrary to the pure and holy nature of God, to the good and righteous law of God, and was in itself, to his view, exceeding sinful: he hated vain thoughts, unclean desires, revengeful lusts, the secret motions of all sin in his heart, and the various evil actions of life; which can never be said of an unregenerate man; who loves sin, delights in iniquity, and takes pleasure in them that do it; and yet what the apostle hated he did; he wrought with his carnal I, his flesh, and through the power of it, and force of temptation, though not without reluctance, remorse, and repentance. The Karaite Jews, which were the better sort of them, say and hold some things, not much unlike to what is here delivered; <p>"though a man (say they (i)) should transgress some of the commandments, or the commandments in part,     , "through the strength of lust, and not on account of, or with pleasure not delight", he shall be one of those that shall enter into paradise.'' <p>(i) R.

For since the law in a man who has not been regenerated brings forth only death, therefore in him it may easily be accused: but seeing that in a man who is regenerated it brings forth good fruit, it better appears that evil actions proceed not from the law but from sin, that is, from our corrupt nature: and therefore the apostle teaches also what the true use of the law is by reproving sin in the regenerated, unto the end of the chapter: as a little before (that is, from the seventh verse until now) Ro 7:7-15, he declared the use of it in those who are not regenerated.<p>(10) The deeds of my life, he says, are not in accordance to my will, rather they are contrary to it. Therefore by the consent of my will with the law, and repugnancy with the deeds of my life, it plainly appears that the law and a properly controlled will induce us to do one thing, but corruption, which also has its seat in the regenerated, another thing.<p>(11) It is to be noted that the very same man is said to will and not to will, in different respects: that is, he is said to will in that he is regenerated by grace: and not to will in that he is not regenerated, or in that he is in the same state into which he was born. But because the part which is regenerated at length becomes conqueror, therefore Paul, speaking on behalf of the regenerated, speaks in such a way as if the corruption which willingly sins were something outside of a man: although afterward he grants that this evil is in his flesh, or in his members.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-15.htm" title="For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.">Romans 7:15</a> elucidates and assigns the reason of this relation of slavery. “<span class="ital">For what I perform I know not</span>,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> it takes place on my part without cognition of its ethical bearing, in the state of bondage of my moral reason.

For whosoever acts in the light of the moral cognition does not, of course, do that which is hateful to him following his practical reason (<span class="greekheb">ὃ μισῶ</span>), but, on the contrary, that towards which his moral desire is directed (<span class="greekheb">ὃ θέλω</span>). The person acting without that cognition, carried away by the power of sin in him, does not pursue as the aim of his activity (<span class="greekheb">πράσσει</span>, comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-32.htm" title="Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.">Romans 1:32</a>) that which in the morally conscious state he <span class="ital">would</span> pursue, but, on the contrary, does (<span class="greekheb">ποιεῖ</span>) what in that state is <span class="ital">abhorrent</span> to him. The ethical power of resolution, which decides for the good, is inactive, and man does the evil that he abhors. Paul consequently ascribes to the unregenerate man also the moral wish, which he has in rational self-determination; but he denies to him the action corresponding thereto, because his moral self-determination does not come into exercise in the state of his natural bondage, but he is, on the contrary, hurried away to the performance of the opposite. His <span class="greekheb">θέλειν</span> of the good and his <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΙΣΕῖΝ</span></span></span> of the evil are not, therefore, those of the regenerate man, because the new man, in virtue of the holy <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span>, emerges from the conflict with the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΆΡΞ</span></span></span> as a conqueror (against Philippi); nor yet the weak <span class="ital">velleitas</span> of the schoolmen (Tholuck, Reithmayr, comp.

There is “an incomprehensible contradiction in his action”. <span class="greekheb">κατεργὰζεσθαι</span> is to effect, to bring about by one’s own work; <span class="greekheb">πράσσειν</span> is to work at, to busy oneself with, a thing, with or without success, but with purpose; <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν</span> is simply to make or produce.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">I do</span>] The Gr. word is strong; <span class="bld">carry out;</span> perhaps with allusion to servile task-work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">allow</span>] In the old English sense of the word; “to allaud,” “to praise, or approve:” so “the Lord <span class="ital">alloweth</span> the righteous,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm" title="On the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.">Psalm 11:6</a>, Prayer-Book.

The following additional comments may further explain the part of it which begins at ver. 15. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The initial <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> introduces proof of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> being in the condition spoken of in the preceding clause, viz. "sold under sin." For (the meaning is) am I not a bond-slave, when, as I feel is the case with me, I am not my own master? But, observe, the state that goes on to be described is that of an unwilling bond-slave; not of one who likes his bondage, and has no desire to be free. The conscience is supposed already, through the operation of law, to protest against sin; to hate its thraldom; not willingly to acquiesce in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The distinction between the verbs <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, not observed in the English Version, but to which attention has been drawn in the above translation, has its meaning. Attention to the places where they occur will show their appropriateness in each case, denoting severally single acts, habitual practice, and general working, performance, or accomplishment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The English Version is wrong in rendering, in ver. 15, "What I would, that I do not," so as to make the idea the same as that in ver. 19. There are really two different statements in the two verses - the first, of our doing what we wish not to do; the second, of our not doing what we wish to do; and after each the same conclusion is drawn in the same words, viz. that sin is the real worker (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> being here the word appropriately used). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The conflicting principles, or energies, of human nature, between which the individual <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, which wills and acts, is here regarded as being distracted, are the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> in which sin dwells (which has been explained above; see note under ver. 14) on the one hand, and the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 23) of the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 22) on the other. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is identified with the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, rather than regarded as an intermediate personality between the two. For it is spoken of throughout as willing what is good; and,. though in ver. 14 it is said to be <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and though, in ver. 18, good dwells not in it, yet the first of these expressions only means that it is in the flesh at present, and therefore in bondage; and the latter is at once qualified by the addition, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; it does not identify the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> with the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>. It is, we may remark in passing, this <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> - that is regarded as rising to a new life with Christ, so as to become a <span class="accented">new man</span>, delivered from bondage; this last expression, of course, involving a different idea from that of the <span class="accented">inward man</span>). It is to be observed, further, that throughout this section beginning at ver. 7, there is no distinction drawn (as elsewhere by St. Paul) between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>; the idea of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, in fact, does not come in at all, except with regard to the Law, which is called <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The reason is that the apostle is confining himself here to an examination of what man, even at his best, is in his mere human nature; of what thoughtful observers, though not theologians, may perceive him to be. It is a philosophical rather than a theological analysis. It is one that might commend itself to heathen philosophers, some of whom have, in fact, expressed themselves much to the same effect. Hence it is not till ch. 8, where man's regeneration by the Divine <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is portrayed, that the spiritual principle in himself, through which he is capable of such regeneration, comes into view. And it will be seen that it is this very idea of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> that pervades that whole chapter. This essential distinction between the two chapters is sufficient in itself to disprove the theory that the regenerate state is described in ch. 7. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The senses in which the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in this chapter require to be perceived and distinguished, its usual sense (see under Romans 2:13) not being uniformly retained. There is, however, always some appended expression to indicate any new application of the word. We find it <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> in its usual sense, with the usual significance of the absence or the presence of the article, in vers. 7, 9, 12, 14, 16; and in ver. 22, still in the same sense, we have "the Law of God." We find also, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> in ver. 23, "the law of my mind," whereby I delight in the "Law of God." Here "law" assumes a different sense from the other, but one in which the word is often used; as when we speak of the laws of nature, having in view, not so much a fiat external to nature which nature must obey, as the uniform rule according to which nature is found to work. The Latin word <span class="accented">norma</span> expresses the idea. Thus "the law of my mind" means the normal constitution of my higher and better self, whereby it cannot but assent to "the Law of God. Then <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> we have "the law of sin in my members;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in a similar sense, an antagonistic rule or constitution dominant in my <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>. Lastly, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> in ver. 21, the general law (in like sense) of my complex human nature, which necessitates this antagonism: "the law, <span class="accented">that</span> when I would do good" (in accordance with the law of the mind), "evil is present with me" (in virtue of the other law). Ancient and other commentators have been much puzzled as to the meaning of ver. 21, from taking <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> at the beginning to denote the Mosaic Law, as <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> usually does when preceded by the article. But not so when there is something after it to denote a different meaning; as there is here in the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> at the end of the verse, meaning <span class="accented">that</span>, not (as some have understood it) <span class="accented">because.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Difficulty has been found in the concluding clause of ver. 25, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, etc. It follows the expression of thanksgiving, "Thanks be to God," etc., which certainly introduced the thought of deliverance from the state that had been described; and hence it is supposed by some that this clause must be a continuance of that thought, and so to be taken as an introduction to ch. 8. rather than a summing up of the preceding argument. It is said also, in support of this view, that more entire association of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> with the Law of God than was before intimated is here expressed; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> being written instead of simply <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> being a stronger word than <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (ver. 22). Thus the meaning would be, "Though in my flesh I still serve the law of sin (the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> still remains in me, notwithstanding my regeneration), yet now <span class="accented">in my very real self</span> I not only <span class="accented">approve</span>, but <span class="accented">am in subjection to</span>, the Law of God." It is, however, at least a question whether these slight differences of expression come to much; and both the introductory <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> and the form of the clause suggest rather its being the summarized result of ch. 7. The additional emphasis added to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> (which had, indeed, already been emphatic), and the substitution of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, may serve only to bring out all the more strongly in the end what it had been the purpose of the whole passage to lead up to, viz. that man's real self, when conscience is fully aroused, yearns for and is ready for redemption. There is no difficulty in so understanding the clause (as we should surely understand it naturally but for the preceding thanksgiving), if we regard the thanksgiving as a parenthetical exclamation, anticipating for a moment the purport of ch. 8. Such an exclamation is characteristic of St. Paul, and it adds life to the passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I do (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-8.htm">Romans 7:8</a>.

Rather desire than will in the sense of full determination, as is shown by I consent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-16.htm">Romans 7:16</a>), and I delight in (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-22.htm">Romans 7:22</a>).<p>Do I not (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>. Rev., correctly, practice: the daily doing which issues in accomplishment (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;).<p>Do I((&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>. More nearly akin to &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; I accomplish, realize. "When I have acted (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;) I find myself face to face with a result which my moral instinct condemns" (Godet). I do not practice what I would, and the outcome is what I hate. </body></html>
