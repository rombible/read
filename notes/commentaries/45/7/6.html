The true reading runs thus: “But as it is we were” (not “are”) “delivered from the Law, having died to that wherein we were held.” In the act of our baptism, which united us to Christ, we obtained a release from our old tyrant, the Law.<p><span class= "bld">Wherein we were held.</span>—Oppressed, held in bondage.<p><span class= "bld">That we should serve.</span>—Rather, perhaps, <span class= "ital">so that we serve;</span> result, not purpose. Our release from one master implied an engagement to another. Our new state is one in which we serve an active living Spirit; our old state was a bondage to the dead and formal letter.<p>The “Spirit” is here the Holy Spirit, as the animating principle of the new life, and as opposed to a system which proceeds merely by external precepts and requirements.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 So long as a man continues under the law as a covenant, and seeks justification by his own obedience, he continues the slave of sin in some form. Nothing but the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, can make any sinner free from the law of sin and death. Believers are delivered from that power of the law, which condemns for the sins committed by them. And they are delivered from that power of the law which stirs up and provokes the sin that dwells in them. Understand this not of the law as a rule, but as a covenant of works. In profession and privilege, we are under a covenant of grace, and not under a covenant of works; under the gospel of Christ, not under the law of Moses. The difference is spoken of under the similitude or figure of being married to a new husband. The second marriage is to Christ. By death we are freed from obligation to the law as a covenant, as the wife is from her vows to her husband. In our believing powerfully and effectually, we are dead to the law, and have no more to do with it than the dead servant, who is freed from his master, has to do with his master's yoke. The day of our believing, is the day of being united to the Lord Jesus. We enter upon a life of dependence on him, and duty to him. Good works are from union with Christ; as the fruitfulness of the vine is the product of its being united to its roots; there is no fruit to God, till we are united to Christ. The law, and the greatest efforts of one under the law, still in the flesh, under the power of corrupt principles, cannot set the heart right with regard to the love of God, overcome worldly lusts, or give truth and sincerity in the inward parts, or any thing that comes by the special sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit. Nothing more than a formal obedience to the outward letter of any precept, can be performed by us, without the renewing, new-creating grace of the new covenant.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But now - Under the gospel. This verse states the consequences of the gospel, in distinction from the effects of the Law. The way in which this is accomplished, the apostle illustrates more at length in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a> with which this verse is properly connected. The remainder of <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a> is occupied in illustrating the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>, of the effects of the Law; and after having shown that its effects always were to increase crime and distress, he is prepared in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8.htm">Romans 8</a> to take up the proposition in this verse, and to show the superiority of the gospel in producing peace.<p>We are delivered - We who are Christians. Delivered from it as a means of justification, as a source of sanctification, as a bondage to which we were subjected, and which tended to produce pain and death. It does not mean that Christians are freed from it as a rule of duty.<p>That being dead - Margin, "Being dead to that." There is a variation here in the manuscripts. Some read it, as in the text, as if the Law was dead; others, as in the margin. as if we were dead. The majority is in favor of the reading as in the margin; and the connection requires us to understand it in this sense. So the Syriac, the Arabic, the Vulgate, AEthiopic. The sentiment here, that we are dead to the Law, is what is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4</a>.<p>Wherein we were held - That is, as captives, or as slaves. We were held in bondage to it; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a>.<p>That we should serve - That we may now serve or obey God.<p>In newness of spirit - In a new spirit; or in a new and spiritual manner. This is a form of expression implying,<p>(1) That their service under the gospel was to be of a new kind, differing from that under the former dispensation.<p>(2) that it was to be of a spiritual nature, as distinguished from that practiced by the Jews; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>; Note, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>.<p>The worship required under the gospel is uniformly described as that of the spirit and the heart, rather than that of form and ceremony; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23</a>, "The true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>.<p>And not in the oldness of the letter - Not in the old letter. It is implied here in this,<p>(1) That the form of worship here described pertained to an old dispensation that had now passed away; and,<p>(2) That that was a worship that was in the letter.<p>To understand this, it is necessary to remember that the Law which prescribed the forms of worship among the Jews, was regarded by the apostle as destitute of that efficacy and power in renewing the heart which he attributed to the gospel. It was a service consisting in external forms and ceremonies; in the offering of sacrifices and of incense, according to the literal requirements of the Law rather than the sincere offering of the heart; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>, "The letter killeth; the spirit giveth life;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9-10</a>. It is not to be denied that there were many holy persons under the Law, and that there were many spiritual offerings presented, but it is at the same time true that the great mass of the people rested in the mere form; and that the service offered was the mere service of the letter, and not of the heart. The main idea is, that the services under the gospel are purely and entirely spiritual, the offering of the heart, and not the service rendered by external forms and rites.<p>(But the contrast here is not between services required under the legal and gospel dispensations respectively, but between service yielded in the opposite states of nature and grace. In the former state, we are "under the law" though we live in gospel times, and in the latter, we are "delivered from the law" as a covenant of works, or of life, just as pious Jews might be though they lived under the dispensation of Moses. The design of God in delivering us from the Law, is, that we might "serve him in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter," that is, in such a spiritual way as the new state requires, and from such spiritual motives and aids as it furnishes; and not in the manner we were accustomed to do, under our old condition of subjection to the Law, in which we could yield only an external and forced obedience. "It is evident," says Prof. Hodge that the clause "in the oldness of the letter is substituted by the apostle, for 'under the law' and 'in the flesh;' all which he uses to describe the legal and corrupt condition of people, prior to the believing reception of the gospel.") <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

From the ministration of it, by Moses; from it, as a covenant of works; from its rigorous exaction; from its curse and condemnation, all this by Christ; and from its being an irritating, provoking law to sin, through the corruption of nature, by the Spirit and grace of Christ; but not from obedience to it, as in the hands of Christ. The Vulgate Latin version, and some copies read, "from the law of death"; and the Ethiopic version renders it, "we are loosed from the law, and are delivered from the former doctrine"; the doctrine of the legal dispensation. <p>That being dead; not sin, but the law: in what sense believers are dead to the law, and that to them; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4</a>. <p>Wherein we were held: as a woman is by the law to her husband, or as persons guilty, who are detained prisoners;

and their Lord and Master Jesus Christ, who is King of saints, lawgiver in his church, and whose commandments are to be observed from a principle of love, in faith, and to his glory; yea, even the law itself, as held forth by him, as the apostle says in the close of this chapter, "with the mind I myself serve the law of God", <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>, the manner in which this service is to be, and is performed, is, <p>in newness of Spirit; under the influences of the Spirit of God, the author of renovation, of the new creature, or new man created in us, in righteousness and true holiness; and from a new heart, and new Spirit, and new principles of life, light, love, and grace, formed in the soul; and by walking in "newness of life", <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>, or by a new life, walk, and conversation: <p>and not in the oldness of the letter; not in the outward observance of the law of Moses, which is the "letter"; not indulging the old man, or walking after the dictates of corrupt nature; nor behaving according to the old former course of living: on the whole it may be observed, that a believer without the law, being delivered from it, that being dead to him, and he to that, lives a better life and conversation under the influence of the Spirit of God, than one that is under the law, and the works of it, destitute of the grace of God; the one brings forth "fruit unto death", <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>, the other serves the Lord, "in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But now we are delivered from the law, that <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> being dead <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> wherein we were <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> held;

Comparing those passages, we find that the practical meaning here of “the letter” is the <span class="ital">Law</span> (as a covenant), and that of “the Spirit,” the <span class="ital">Gospel</span>. The common ground on which they are compared and contrasted is that of Obedience; at which both Law and Gospel ultimately aim. The Law does so “by the letter,” by prescribing its own inexorable terms. The Gospel does so “by the Spirit;” by the Divine plan of Redemption, which brings direct on the soul the influence of “the Spirit of the Son of God,” who “pours out the love of God in the heart” (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-5.htm" title="And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us.">Romans 5:5</a>). The Gospel thus both intends, and effects, the <span class="ital">submission of the will</span> to the will of God; a submission absolute and real; a bondservice. But the bond is now the power of adoring and grateful love.—It will be seen that we take “Spirit” here to mean the Holy Paraclete. The Gr. word rarely, if ever, bears our modern sense of “the <span class="ital">spirit</span> of a law, of an institution, &c.” It must here be, then, either the human spirit or the Divine Spirit. And as the idea of “the letter” is that of an objective ruling power, so it is best to explain “the Spirit” as objective also to the man, and therefore here the Divine Spirit.—We may now paraphrase the last words, “so that we might live as bondmen still, but in the sacred novelty of the bondservice which the Holy Ghost constrains, not in the now-obsolete way of the bondservice prescribed by the covenant of merit”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀποθανόντες</span>, <span class="ital">being dead</span>) So <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a>, <span class="ital">ye became dead</span>, said of that party, which corresponds to the wife: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm" title="For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to God.">Galatians 2:19</a>.

Here he intimates the true character of our new service by the addition of the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. These are characteristic and significant expressions. "Spirit" and "letter" are similarly contrasted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>). "Spiritum literae opponit, quia antequam ad Dei voluntatem voluntas nostra per Spiritum sanctum formats sit, non habemus in Lege nisi externam literam; quae fraenum quidem externis nostris actionibus injicit, concupiscientiae autem nostrae furorem minime cohibet. Novitatem. vero Spiritui attribuit, quia in locum veteris hominis succedit; ut litera vetus dicitur quae interit per Spiritus regenerationem" (Calvin). Otherwise, with regard to <span class="accented">newness</span> and <span class="accented">old</span>ness, "Vetustatis et novitatis vocabulo Paulus spectat duo testamenta" (Bengel). That the latter idea may have suggested the expressions seems not unlikely from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6-18</a> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>). For in both these passages the idea of the verse before us enters, and in both the old and new covenants are contrasted with regard to it. It may be enough here to say that the contrast in its essence is between exacted conformity to an external code (which was the characteristic of the old covenant) and inspired allegiance to the Law of God written on the heart (which is the characteristic of the new). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>We are delivered (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., have been discharged, as the woman, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2</a>.
