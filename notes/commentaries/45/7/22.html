It stands rather midway between it and the spirit. The mind is the moral and rational faculties considered as moral and rational. “The inward man” is the higher part of man’s nature considered as capable of receiving the divine grace. The “spirit” is the same when actually brought into communion with God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-22.htm" title="For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:">Romans 7:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">For I delight in the law of God </span>— On this verse, chiefly, rests the opinion that the apostle, in the latter part of this chapter, is describing the character of a regenerate man. Its votaries think they find in this verse all the marks of a Christian. In general they assert, “to have our inward man, our mind and heart, delighted in the law of God, is to have our souls delighted in a conformity to him; it is to love God himself, to love to be like him in the inward man, having his law written on our hearts, which they say is the sum of all religion.” This is not reasoning, it is mere assertion; it is not to be inferred from this passage, and is plainly contradicted by the context. All judicious commentators will allow, that if any passage of the Scriptures appears obscure or susceptible of two senses, it must be explained in a consistency with what precedes and follows, and that interpretation must be chosen which agrees best therewith. Therefore, though it be true, in the fullest sense, that regenerated persons <span class="ital">delight in the law of God after the inward man; </span>yet, since the general scope of the paragraph, and the connection of this sentence with the context, show that Paul is here speaking of his unconverted state, our interpretation of it must be regulated by its connection with the whole passage. Those who maintain that Paul is here speaking of his state after his conversion, assert, that by <span class="ital">the inward man </span>is meant, <span class="ital">the new man, </span>or man of grace, spoken of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>. Did the context lead to that sense, it might be admitted. But the general sense of the whole passage leads us to understand the expression of the rational part of man, in opposition to the animal, which is its usual signification, as has been shown by several authors. The phrase occurs in two other passages of the New Testament, namely, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>; in the former, the apostle’s words are, <span class="ital">We faint not, though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day; </span>where the inward man must signify the mind or soul, which is renewed, or created anew in its faculties, in proportion as it grows in grace. In the other passage the apostle prays for the Ephesians that they might be strengthened with might, not in the outward man, the body, which was not a matter of much importance, but in the <span class="ital">inward man, </span>the soul; that it might become strong in faith, fervent in love, and conformed to the divine image; and that Christ, by his Spirit, might dwell in it. “The inward man, therefore, always signifies the mind, which either may or may not be the subject of grace. That which is asserted of either the inward or outward man, is often performed by one member or power, and not with the whole man. If any member of the body perform an action, we are said to do it with the body, although the other members be not employed. In like manner, if any power or faculty of the mind be employed about any action, the soul is said to act: [and with still greater propriety, as] our souls are not, like our bodies, made of many members; they are pure spirits, and indivisible. If the mind wills, it is the spirit willing; if it hates, it is the soul hating; if it loves, it is the soul loving; if conscience reprove or excuse, it is the inward man accusing or excusing. This expression, therefore, <span class="ital">I delight in the law of God after the inward man, </span>can mean no more than this, that there are some inward faculties in the soul which delight in the law of God. The expression is particularly adapted to the principles of the Pharisees, of whom Paul was one before his conversion. They received the law as the oracles of God, and confessed that it deserved the most serious regard. Their veneration was inspired by a sense of its original, and a full conviction that it was right. To some parts of it they paid the most superstitious regard. They had it written upon their phylacteries, and carried these about with them at all times. It was often read and expounded in their synagogues, and they took some degree of pleasure in studying its precepts. On that account, the prophets and our Saviour agree in saying, that they delighted in the law of God, though they regarded not its chief and most essential precepts.” — Smith, <span class="ital">On the Carnal Man’s Character.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:18-22 The more pure and holy the heart is, it will have the more quick feeling as to the sin that remains in it. The believer sees more of the beauty of holiness and the excellence of the law. His earnest desires to obey, increase as he grows in grace. But the whole good on which his will is fully bent, he does not do; sin ever springing up in him, through remaining corruption, he often does evil, though against the fixed determination of his will. The motions of sin within grieved the apostle. If by the striving of the flesh against the Spirit, was meant that he could not do or perform as the Spirit suggested, so also, by the effectual opposition of the Spirit, he could not do what the flesh prompted him to do. How different this case from that of those who make themselves easy with regard to the inward motions of the flesh prompting them to evil; who, against the light and warning of conscience, go on, even in outward practice, to do evil, and thus, with forethought, go on in the road to perdition! For as the believer is under grace, and his will is for the way of holiness, he sincerely delights in the law of God, and in the holiness which it demands, according to his inward man; that new man in him, which after God is created in true holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I delight - The word used here &#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  Sune&#772;domai, occurs no where else in the New Testament. It properly means to rejoice with anyone; and expresses not only approbation of the understanding, as the expression, "I consent unto the law," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-16.htm">Romans 7:16</a>, but more than that it denotes sensible pleasure in the heart. It indicates not only intellectual assent, but emotion, an emotion of pleasure in the contemplation of the Law. And this shows that the apostle is not speaking of an unrenewed man. Of such a man it might be said that his conscience approved the Law; that his understanding was convinced that the Law was good; but never yet did it occur that an impenitent sinner found emotions of pleasure in the contemplation of the pure and spiritual Law of God. If this expression can be applied to an unrenewed man, there is, perhaps, not a single mark of a pious mind which may not with equal propriety be so applied. It is the natural, obvious, and usual mode of denoting the feelings of piety, an assent to the divine Law followed with emotions of sensible delight in the contemplation. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-97.htm">Psalm 119:97</a>, "O how love I thy law; it is my meditation all the day." <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, "but his delight is in the law of the Lord." <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-12.htm">Job 23:12</a>.<p>In the law of God - The word "law" here is used in a large sense, to denote all the communications which God had made to control man. The sense is, that the apostle was pleased with the whole. One mark of genuine piety is to be pleased with the whole of the divine requirements.<p>After the inward man - In respect to the inward man. The expression "the inward man" is used sometimes to denote the rational part of man as opposed to the sensual; sometimes the mind as opposed to the body (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>). It is thus used by the Greek classic writers. Here it is used evidently in opposition to a carnal and corrupt nature; to the evil passions and desires of the soul in an unrenewed state; to what is called elsewhere "the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts." <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>. The "inward man" is called elsewhere "the new man" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>; and denotes not the mere intellect, or conscience, but is a personification of the principles of action by which a Christian is governed; the new nature; the holy disposition; the inclination of the heart that is renewed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man&#8212;"from the bottom of my heart." The word here rendered "delight" is indeed stronger than "consent" in Ro 7:16; but both express a state of mind and heart to which the unregenerate man is a stranger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This shows yet more expressly that the apostle speaketh in the person of a regenerate man, or of himself as regenerate.

This an unregenerate man cannot do; he does not like its commands, they are disagreeable to his corrupt nature; and as it is a threatening, cursing, damning law, it can never be delighted in by him: the moralist, the Pharisee, who obeys it externally, do not love it, nor delight in it; he obeys it not from love to its precepts, but from fear of its threatenings; from a desire of popular esteem, and from low, mercenary, selfish views, in order to gain the applause of men, and favour of God: only a regenerate man delights in the law of God; which he does, as it is fulfilled by Christ, who has answered all the demands of it: and as it is in the hands of Christ, held forth by him as a rule of holy walk and conversation; and as it is written upon his heart by the Spirit of God, to which he yields a voluntary and cheerful obedience: he serves it with his mind, of a ready mind freely, and without any constraint but that of love; he delights together with the law, as the word here used signifies; the delight is mutual and reciprocal, the law delights in him, and he delights in the law; and they both delight in the selfsame things, and particularly in the perfect obedience which the Son of God has yielded to it. The apostle adds, <p>after the inward man; by which he means the renewed man, the new man, or new nature, formed in his soul; which had its seat in the inward part, is an internal principle, oil in the vessel of the heart, a seed under ground, the kingdom within us, the hidden man of the heart, which is not obvious to everyone's view, it being not anything that is external, though never so good: this in its nature is agreeable to the law of God, and according to this a regenerate man delights in it: but then this restrictive limiting clause supposes another man, the old man, the carnal I, according to which the apostle did not delight in the law of God; and proves, that he speaks of himself as regenerate, and not as unregenerate, or as representing an unregenerate man, because no such distinction is to be found in such a person; nor does such a person delight at all, in any sense, upon any consideration in the law of God, but is enmity against it, and not subjected to it; nor can he be otherwise, without the grace of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I delight in the law of God after the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> inward man:</span><p>(b) The inner man and the new man are the same, and are compared and contrasted with the old man; and neither do these words inward man signify man's mind and reason, and the old man the physical body that is subject to them, as the philosophers imagine: but by the outward man is meant whatever is either without or within a man from top to bottom, as long as that man is not born again by the grace of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-22.htm" title="For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:...">Romans 7:22-23</a>.

Instead, namely, of saying: “and made me <span class="ital">its</span> prisoner,” Paul characterizes—as he could not avoid doing in order to complete the antithesis—the victorious law, not previously characterized, <span class="ital">as that which it is</span>, and says: <span class="greekheb">αἰχμαλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">με τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νόμῳ ἁμαρτ</span>. Here <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτ</span>. is the <span class="ital">genitivus auctoris;</span> <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νόμῳ</span>, however, is not instrumental (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact), but can only be taken as the dative of <span class="ital">reference</span> (commodi). The observation <span class="greekheb">τῷ ὄντι ἐν τοῖς μέλεσί μου</span>, emphatically added to make the disgrace more palpably felt, obviates the misconception that a power different from the <span class="greekheb">ἕτερος νόμος</span> was meant. We must dismiss, therefore, the distinctions unsupported by evidence that (following Origen, Jerome, and Oecumenius, but not Ambrosiaster) have been attempted; <span class="ital">e.g.</span> recently by Köllner, who thinks that the <span class="greekheb">ἕτερος νόμος</span> means the demands of the sensuous nature, so far as they manifest themselves in individual cases as bodily lusts, while the <span class="greekheb">νόμος τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτ</span>. is the sensuous nature itself conceived as a sinful principle; or by de Wette, who thinks that the former is the proneness to sin which expresses itself in the determinableness of the will by the sensuous nature, while the latter is the same proneness, so far as it conflicts with the law of God, and by the completed resolution actually enters into antagonism thereto (comp. Umbreit); or by Ewald (comp. also Grotius and van Hengel), who thinks that Paul here distinguishes <span class="ital">two pairs</span> of kindred laws: (1) the eternal <span class="ital">law of God</span>, and alongside of it, but too weak in itself, <span class="ital">the law of reason;</span> and (2) the <span class="ital">law of desire</span>, and along with it, as still mightier, the <span class="ital">law of sin</span>. Similarly also Delitzsch, Reithmayr, and Hofmann. The latter distinguishes the law <span class="ital">of sin</span> from the law <span class="ital">in the members</span>, in such a way that the <span class="ital">former</span> is prescribed by sin, as the lawgiver, to <span class="ital">all those</span> who are subject to it; the <span class="ital">latter</span>, on the contrary, rules in the bodily nature of the <span class="ital">individual</span>, as soon as the desire arises in him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αἰχμαλωτίζω</span> belongs to the age of Diodorus, Josephus, etc. (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑἸΧΜΑΛΩΤΕΎΩ</span></span></span> is still later). See Thom. Mag. p. 23; Lobeck <span class="ital">ad Phryn.</span> p. 442.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-22.htm" title="For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:">Romans 7:22</a> f. Further explanation: the incongruity between inclination and action has its roots in a division within man’s nature. The law of God legislates for him, and in the inner man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm" title="That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;">Ephesians 3:16</a>) he delights in it. The inner man is not equivalent to the new or regenerate man; it is that side of every man’s nature which is akin to God, and is the point of attachment, so to speak, for the regenerating spirit. It is called inward because it is not seen. What <span class="ital">is</span> seen is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>. Here also <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> is not used in the modern physical sense, but imaginatively: “I see that a power to legislate, of a different kind (different from the law of God), asserts itself in my members, making war on the law of my mind”. The law of my mind is practically identical with the law of God in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-22.htm" title="For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:">Romans 7:22</a> : and the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> itself, if not identical with <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἔσω ἄνθρωπος</span>, is its chief organ. Paul does not see in his nature two normal modes in which certain forces operate; he sees two authorities saying to him, Do this, and the higher succumbing to the lower. As the lower prevails, it leads him captive to the law of Sin which is in his members, or in other words to itself; “of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage”. The end therefore is that man, as a creature of flesh, living under law, does what Sin enjoins. It is the law of Sin to which he gives obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">I delight in</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">I delight with</span>. The Law, as the will of God, is quasi-personified, and the regenerate soul “rejoices <span class="ital">with it</span>” in its delight in holiness and truth. The Law’s loves and hatreds are those also of the soul. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-6.htm" title="Rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;">1 Corinthians 13:6</a>, where render, “rejoiceth <span class="ital">with</span> the Truth.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the inward man</span>] The regenerate Self. Not that the phrase <span class="ital">necessarily</span> means the regenerate self, as does the phrase “the <span class="ital">new</span> man” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm" title="For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.">Ephesians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>). In itself it may mean (as Meyer holds) no more than “the rational and moral element in human nature.” But surely this does not, according to St Paul, “delight”—with the delight of the <span class="ital">will</span>—“with the Law,” until grace has rectified its fall. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>, where “the <span class="ital">mind</span>” is the <span class="ital">seat of</span> “<span class="ital">enmity</span>.” The phrase in this context therefore points to the regenerate state; the self as it is by grace, distinguished from “the flesh.”—A fit illustration of this verse is Psalms 119, where the inspired Saint indeed “delights with,” and in, the Law, and yet continually makes confession and entreaty as a sinner.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-22.htm" title="For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:">Romans 7:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συνήδομαι</span>, <span class="ital">I delight</span>) This too is already a further step in advance than <span class="greekheb">σύμφημι</span>, <span class="ital">I consent</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-16.htm" title="If then I do that which I would not, I consent to the law that it is good.">Romans 7:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν ἔσω</span>, <span class="ital">the inward</span>) He already upholds the name and character of the inward, but not yet however of the <span class="ital">new</span> man; so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
