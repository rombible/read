We may suppose that the substance of this verse recurs to the Apostle’s mind after the parenthetical statement just inserted, and though he does not repeat it in words, he connects on to it the sequence of his thought. “The Christian should not put a stumbling-block in his brother’s way. Not, indeed, that there is anything unclean in itself, but relatively to the person who so regards it. it is unclean. [Therefore the Christian should be careful as to what he does.] For to cause distress to another about a mere matter of food is to be uncharitable.”<p>Two stages are noted in the words “grieved” and “destroy.” When one man sees another do that which his own conscience condemns, it causes him pain, but when he is further led on from this to do <span class= "ital">himself</span> what his conscience condemns, he is in danger of a worse fate; he is morally ruined and undone. The work of redemption that Christ has wrought for him is cancelled, and all that great and beneficent scheme is hindered of its operation by an act of thoughtlessness or want of consideration on the part of a fellow Christian.<p><span class= "bld">With thy meat.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">because of meat,</span> on a mere question of meat.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:14-18 Christ deals gently with those who have true grace, though they are weak in it. Consider the design of Christ's death: also that drawing a soul to sin, threatens the destruction of that soul. Did Christ deny himself for our brethren, so as to die for them, and shall not we deny ourselves for them, so as to keep from any indulgence? We cannot hinder ungoverned tongues from speaking evil; but we must not give them any occasion. We must deny ourselves in many cases what we may lawfully do, when our doing it may hurt our good name. Our good often comes to be evil spoken of, because we use lawful things in an uncharitable and selfish manner. As we value the reputation of the good we profess and practise, let us seek that it may not be evil-spoken of. Righteousness, peace, and joy, are words that mean a great deal. As to God, our great concern is to appear before him justified by Christ's death, sanctified by the Spirit of his grace; for the righteous Lord loveth righteousness. As to our brethren, it is to live in peace, and love, and charity with them; following peace with all men. As to ourselves, it is joy in the Holy Ghost; that spiritual joy wrought by the blessed Spirit in the hearts of believers, which respects God as their reconciled Father, and heaven as their expected home. Regard to Christ in doing our duties, alone can make them acceptable. Those are most pleasing to God that are best pleased with him; and they abound most in peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. They are approved by wise and good men; and the opinion of others is not to be regarded.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if thy brother ... - This address is to the "Gentile" convert. In the previous verse, Paul admitted. that the prejudice of the Jew was not well-founded. But admitting that still the question was, "how" he should be treated while he had that prejudice. The apostle here shows the Gentile that "he" ought not so to act as unnecessarily to wound his feelings, or to grieve him.<p>Be grieved - Be pained; as a conscientious man always is, when he sees another, and especially a Christian brother, do anything which "he" esteems to be wrong. The "pain" would be real, though the "opinion" from which it arose might not be well founded.<p>With thy meat - Greek, On account of meat, or food; that is, because "you" eat what he regards as unclean.<p>Now walkest - To "walk," in the Sacred Scriptures, often denotes to act, or to do a thing; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-5.htm">Mark 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>. Here it means that if the Gentile convert persevered in the use of such food, notwithstanding the conscientious scruples of the Jew, he violated the law of love.<p>Charitably - Greek, According to charity, or love; that is, he would violate that law which required him to sacrifice his own comfort to promote the happiness of his brother; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-5.htm">1 Corinthians 13:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-24.htm">1 Corinthians 10:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-28.htm">1 Corinthians 10:28-29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-21.htm">Philippians 2:21</a>.<p>Destroy not him - The word "destroy" here refers, doubtless, to the ruin of the soul in hell. It properly denotes ruin or destruction, and is applied to the ruin or "corruption" of various things, in the New Testament. To life <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-39.htm">Matthew 10:39</a>; to a reward, in the sense of "losing" it <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-41.htm">Mark 10:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4</a>; to food <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm">John 6:27</a>; to the Israelites represented as lost or wandering <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-6.htm">Matthew 10:6</a>; to "wisdom" that is rendered "vain" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>; to "bottles," rendered "useless" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>, etc. But it is also frequently applied to destruction in hell, to the everlasting ruin of the soul; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>, "Who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-14.htm">Matthew 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-15.htm">John 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>. That "this" is its meaning here is apparent from the parallel place in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-11.htm">1 Corinthians 8:11</a>, "And through thy knowledge shall thy weak brother perish." If it be asked how the eating of meat by the Gentile convert could be connected with the perdition of the Jew, I reply, that the apostle supposes that in this way an occasion of stumbling would be afforded to him, and he would come into condemnation. He might be led by example to partake against his own conscience, or he might be excited to anger, disgust, and apostasy from the Christian faith. Though the apostle believed that all who were true Christians would be saved, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30-39</a>, yet he believed that it would be brought about by the use of means, and that nothing should be done that would tend to hinder or endanger their salvation; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a>. God does not bring his people to heaven without the use of "means adapted to the end," and one of those means is that employed here to warn professing Christians against such conduct as might jeopard the salvation of their brethren.<p>For whom Christ died - The apostle speaks here of the possibility of endangering the salvation of those for whom Christ died, just as he does respecting the salvation of those who are in fact Christians. By those for whom Christ died, he undoubtedly refers here to "true Christians," for the whole discussion relates to them, and them only; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/14-3.htm">Romans 14:3-4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/14-7.htm">Romans 14:7-8</a>. This passage should not be brought, therefore, to prove that Christ died for all people, or for any who shall finally perish. Such a doctrine is undoubtedly true (in this sense; that there is in the death of Christ a "sufficiency for all," and that the "offer" is to all.) (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>), but it is not the truth which is taught here. The design is to show the criminality of a course that would tend to the ruin of a brother. For these weak brethren, Christ laid down his precious life. He loved them; and shall we, to gratify our appetites, pursue a course which will tend to defeat the work of Christ, and ruin the souls redeemed by his blood? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. But if thy brother be grieved&#8212;has his weak conscience hurt<p>with thy meat&#8212;rather, "because of meat." The word "meat" is purposely selected as something contemptible in contrast with the tremendous risk run for its sake. Accordingly, in the next clause, that idea is brought out with great strength.<p>Destroy not him with&#8212;"by"<p>thy meat for whom Christ died&#8212;"The worth of even the poorest and weakest brother cannot be more emphatically expressed than by the words, 'for whom Christ died'" [Olshausen]. The same sentiment is expressed with equal sharpness in 1Co 8:11. Whatever tends to make anyone violate his conscience tends to the destruction of his soul; and he who helps, whether wittingly or no, to bring about the one is guilty of aiding to accomplish the other.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In this verse you have two reasons to induce the strong not to offend the weak: First, it is contrary to charity; to grieve a brother upon the score of meats, is to walk uncharitably; it is a violation of the royal law of love, which is against the grieving or offending others, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,">1 Corinthians 13:4</a></span>. Two ways are weak Christians grieved, when others do unseasonably use their liberty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. They think such do offend God in eating that which he hath forbidden; and this is matter of grief to those that fear God, to see others transgress his laws. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. They may be drawn by their example to do the like, against their own light and conscience; and this afterwards causeth grief and trouble; their consciences hereby are galled and wounded, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-12.htm" title="But when you sin so against the brothers, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.">1 Corinthians 8:12</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died:</span> this is the second reason why Christians should not use their liberty to the offence of others; it may occasion their ruin and destruction: q.d. Hereby, as much as in you lies, you take a course to destroy them for whom Christ died. You will alienate and estrange them from the Christian religion, or you will draw them into sin, and induce them (as before) to act against their consciences, and so hazard their salvation. See a parallel place, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-11.htm" title="And through your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?">1 Corinthians 8:11</a></span>. Here a question may arise, whether any can perish for whom Christ died? The answer is, They cannot; and for this the Scripture is express, in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-28.htm" title="And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.">John 10:28</a></span>. See also <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm" title="For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.">Matthew 24:24</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.">John 6:39</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1 Peter 1:5</a></span>. How then is this text to be understood? The apostle doth not speak of those for whom Christ indeed did die, but of such as, in the judgment of charity, are held to be of that number. We must account all those who confess the faith of Christ, for such as he hath redeemed by his death. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat,.... The apostle proceeds to give reasons why, though he was so fully persuaded that nothing was unclean of itself, and so he, and any other of the same persuasion, might lawfully eat anything; yet they should forbear, and not make use of this liberty; because if a brother should be grieved by it, that is, either should be concerned and troubled at it inwardly, both because the person that eats is thought by him to have transgressed a command of God, and because he himself is not only despised as a weak brother, but as if he was a "judaizing" Christian, and walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the Gospel; or else should be emboldened thereby to eat, and so wound and defile his weak conscience; or be so galled and offended at it, as to stumble and fall off from his profession of Christianity, and withdraw his communion, as judging there is nothing in it, no regard being had to the law of God: <p>now walkest thou not charitably; this is a breach of the rule of charity or brotherly love; such an one is a brother, and though a weak one, yet he is to be loved as a brother, and to be charitably walked with: true charity, or love, vaunts not itself over, nor is it puffed up against a weak brother; nor is it unconcerned for his peace, but bears with his weaknesses, and forbears the use of things grieving to him: <p>destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. This is to be understood, not of eternal destruction, that can never be thought to be either in the will or power of any man; such a degree of malice can never arise in the heart of any, to wish for, desire, or take any step towards the eternal damnation of another; and could any thing of this kind be among the men of the world, yet surely not among brethren of the same faith, and in the same church state; and were there any so wicked as to desire this, yet it is not in their power to compass it, for none can destroy eternally but God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>; besides, it is not reasonable to suppose, that eternal damnation should follow upon eating things indifferent, or be caused by an offence either given or taken through them; moreover, though such as only think themselves, or profess themselves, or are only thought by others to be such, for whom Christ died, may be eternally destroyed, yet none of those can, for whom Christ really died; for they are his special people, his peculiar friends, his own sheep, his body the church, which can never perish; and he, by dying, has procured such blessings for them, such as a justifying righteousness, pardon of sin, peace with God, and eternal life, which will for ever secure them from destruction: besides, should anyone of them be destroyed, the death of Christ would be so far in vain, nor would it appear to be a sufficient security from condemnation, nor a full satisfaction to the justice of God; or God must be unjust, to punish twice for the same fault: but this is to be understood of the destruction of such a man's peace and comfort, which is signified by grieving, stumbling, offending, and making him weak; and the words are a fresh reason, why they that are strong in the faith of Christian liberty, should nevertheless forbear the use of it, to preserve the peace of a weak brother; which is a matter of importance, and the rather to be attended to, since it is the peace of one that belongs to Christ, whom he has so loved as to die for, and therefore should be the object of the regard and affections of such as believe in Christ and love him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But if thy brother be grieved with <i>thy</i> meat, now walkest thou not charitably. <span class="cverse3">{14}</span> Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom <span class="cverse3">{15}</span> Christ died.</span><p>(14) It is the part of a cruel mind to make more account of meat than of our brother's salvation.
