No one who has given up his name to Christ, is allowedly a self-seeker; that is against true Christianity. The business of our lives is not to please ourselves, but to please God. That is true Christianity, which makes Christ all in all. Though Christians are of different strength, capacities, and practices in lesser things, yet they are all the Lord's; all are looking and serving, and approving themselves to Christ. He is Lord of those that are living, to rule them; of those that are dead, to revive them, and raise them up. Christians should not judge or despise one another, because both the one and the other must shortly give an account. A believing regard to the judgment of the great day, would silence rash judgings. Let every man search his own heart and life; he that is strict in judging and humbling himself, will not be apt to judge and despise his brother. We must take heed of saying or doing things which may cause others to stumble or to fall. The one signifies a lesser, the other a greater degree of offence; that which may be an occasion of grief or of guilt to our brother.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For to this end - For this purpose or design. The apostle does not say that this was the "only" design of his death, but that it was a main purpose, or an object which he had distinctly in view. This declaration is introduced in order to confirm what he had said in the previous verse, that in all circumstances we are the Lord's. This he shows by the fact that Jesus died "in order" that we "might" be his.<p>And rose - This expression is rejected by most modern critics. It is wanting in many manuscripts, and has been probably introduced in the text from the margin.<p>And revived - There is also a variation in the Greek in this place, but not so great as to change the sense materially. It refers to his "resurrection," and means that he was "restored to life" in order that he might exercise dominion over the dead and the living.<p>That he might be Lord - Greek. That he might "rule over." The Greek word used here implies the idea of his being "proprietor" or "owner" as well as "ruler." It means that he might exercise entire dominion over all, as the sovereign Lawgiver and Lord.<p>Both of the dead - That is, of those who "are" deceased, or who have gone to another state of existence. This passage proves that those who die are not annihilated; that they do not cease to be conscious; and that they still are under the dominion of the Mediator. Though their bodies moulder in the grave, yet the spirit lives, and is under his control. And though the body dies and returns to its native dust, yet the Lord Jesus is still its Sovereign, and shall raise it up again:<p>"God our Redeemer lives,<p>And often from the skies.<p>Looks down and watches all our dust,<p>Till he shall bid it rise."<p>It gives an additional sacredness to the grave when we reflect that the tomb is under the watchful care of the Redeemer. Safe in his hands, the body may sink to its native dust with the assurance that in his own time he will again call it forth, with renovated and immortal powers, to be for ever subject to his will. With this view, we can leave our friends with confidence in his hands when they die, and yield our own bodies cheerfully to the dust when he shall call our spirits hence. But it is not only over the "body" that his dominion is established. This passage proves that the departed souls of the saints are still subject to him; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-27.htm">Mark 12:27</a>. He not only has "dominion" over those spirits, but he is their protector and Lord. They are safe under his universal dominion. And it does much to alleviate the pains of separation from pious, beloved friends, to reflect that they depart still to love and serve the same Saviour in perfect purity, and unvexed by infirmity and sin. Why should we wish to recall them from his perfect love in the heavens to the poor and imperfect service which they would render if in the land of the living?<p>And living - To the redeemed, while they remain in this life. He died to "purchase" them to himself, that they might become his obedient subjects; and they are bound to yield obedience by all the sacredness and value of the price which he paid, even his own precious blood; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>, "For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a> (Greek, "bought"); <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, (Greek, "purchased"). If it be asked how this "dominion over the dead and the living" is connected with the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, we may reply,<p>(1) That it is secured over Christians from the fact that they are "purchased" or "ransomed" by his precious blood; and that they are bound by this sacred consideration to live to him. This obligation every Christian feels <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>, and its force is continually resting on him. It was by the love of Christ that he was ever brought to love God at all; and his deepest and tenderest obligations to live to him arise from this source; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14-15</a>.<p>(2) Jesus, by his death and resurrection, established a dominion over the grave. He destroyed him that had the power of death, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>, and triumphed over him; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>. Satan is a humbled foe; and his sceptre over the grave is wrested from his hands. When Jesus rose, in spite of all the power of Satan and of people, he burst the bands of death, and made an invasion on the dominions of the dead, and showed that he had power to control all.<p>(3) this dominion of the Lord Jesus is felt by the spirits on high. They are subject to him because he redeemed them; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

This last word "revived" is omitted by the Vulgate Latin, but very naturally placed by the Syriac, between Christ's dying and rising. The Alexandrian copy reads, "died and lived": and the Ethiopic version, "died and revived": the end of all which was, <p>that he might be the Lord both of the dead and living; that is, of believers, whether dead or alive; for though he is Lord of all, as God and Creator, yet his appearing to be Lord by his dying, rising, and living again, can only have respect to them, for whom dying he has abolished death, and destroyed Satan; whom he has redeemed from sin, and delivered from this present evil world; and so having freed them from those other lords which had the dominion over them, shows himself to be their one and only Lord: and by rising again from the dead, ascending to heaven, and sitting at the right hand of God, all creatures and things being subject to him, he is made or declared both Lord and Christ; and living again, and continuing to live for ever, he appears to have the keys of hell and death; and will open the graves, and raise from thence, and judge both quick and dead, those that will be found alive at his coming, and such as he will cause to rise from the dead then; till which time, the apostle suggests, the decision of these differences about meats and days was to be left; and in the mean time the saints were to cultivate peace and love among themselves. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-9.htm" title="For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.">Romans 14:9</a>.

Baumgarten reads <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀνέστη</span>, and alleges the probability of omission on the part of the transcribers, but gives no reason for this probability. I think the addition probably is due to this, that the transcribers very easily laid hold of a very well-known expression concerning Christ, <span class="greekheb">ἀπέθανε καὶ ἀνέστη</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>; and when this was done, some omitted <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔζησεν</span>, others, however, also retained it, and moreover placed it either first, as in <span class="ital">Iren</span>. l. iii. c. 20; or in the middle, as in the Syriac version; or third in order, as in Chrysostom, who, however, in his exposition, passes over the <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀνέστη</span>.

I have cleared away the objection from the testimonies of the fathers, adduced by him, in the <span class="ital">Apparatus</span>. The reading <span class="greekheb">ἔζησεν</span> is well supported; <span class="greekheb">ἀνέζησεν</span> rests on much weaker authority.[144]—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΚΞῶΝ</span></span></span>, of <span class="ital">the dead</span>) The dying and the dead rejoice in the Lord Jesus, who has died and abolished death and vanquished the devil, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ζώντων</span>, <span class="ital">of the living</span>) The living and those, who are made alive again, triumph with their living Redeemer, their Kinsman (Heb. <span class="ital">Goel</span>.)
