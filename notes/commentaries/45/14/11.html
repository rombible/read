No one who has given up his name to Christ, is allowedly a self-seeker; that is against true Christianity. The business of our lives is not to please ourselves, but to please God. That is true Christianity, which makes Christ all in all. Though Christians are of different strength, capacities, and practices in lesser things, yet they are all the Lord's; all are looking and serving, and approving themselves to Christ. He is Lord of those that are living, to rule them; of those that are dead, to revive them, and raise them up. Christians should not judge or despise one another, because both the one and the other must shortly give an account. A believing regard to the judgment of the great day, would silence rash judgings. Let every man search his own heart and life; he that is strict in judging and humbling himself, will not be apt to judge and despise his brother. We must take heed of saying or doing things which may cause others to stumble or to fall. The one signifies a lesser, the other a greater degree of offence; that which may be an occasion of grief or of guilt to our brother.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For it is written - This passage is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>. It is not quoted literally, but the sense is preserved. In Isaiah there can be no doubt that it refers to Yahweh. The speaker expressly calls himself Yahweh, the name which is appropriate to God alone, and which is never applied to a creature; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-18.htm">Romans 14:18</a>. In the place before us, the words are applied by Paul expressly to Christ; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10</a>. This mode of quotation is a strong incidental proof that the apostle regarded the Lord Jesus as divine. On no other principle could he have made these quotations.<p>As I live - The Hebrew is, "I have sworn by myself." One expression is equivalent to the other. An "oath" of God is often expressed by the phrase "as I live;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-16.htm">Ezekiel 14:16</a>, etc.<p>Saith the Lord - These words are not in the Hebrew text, but are added by the apostle to show that the passage quoted was spoken by the Lord, the Messiah; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-18.htm">Isaiah 45:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-22.htm">Isaiah 45:22</a>.<p>Every knee shall bow to me - To bow the knee" is an act expressing homage, submission, or adoration. It means that every person shall acknowledge him as God, and admit his right to universal dominion. The passage in Isaiah refers particularly to the homage which "his own people" should render to him; or rather, it means that all who are saved shall acknowledge "him" as their God and Saviour. The original reference was not to "all men," but only to those who should be saved; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-17.htm">Isaiah 45:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-21.htm">Isaiah 45:21-22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>. In this sense the apostle uses it; not as denoting that "all men" should confess to God, but that all "Christians," whether Jewish or Gentile converts, should alike give account to Him. "They" should all bow before their common God, and acknowledge "his" dominion over them. The passage originally did not refer particularly to the day of judgment, but expressed the truth that all believers should acknowledge his dominion. It is as applicable, however, to the judgment, as to any other act of homage which his people will render.<p>Every tongue shall confess to God - In the Hebrew, "Every tongue shall swear." Not swear "by God," but "to him;" that is, pay to him our vows, or "answer to him on oath" for our conduct; and this is the same as confessing to him, or acknowledging him as our Judge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11, 12.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>; though Justin Martyr (o) cites a like passage with what follows, as out of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37.htm">Ezekiel 37</a>, but no such words appear there, either in the Hebrew text, or Septuagint version: <p>as I live, saith the Lord; the form of an oath used often by the Lord; who because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself, by his own life; signifying, that what he was about to say, would as surely come to pass, as that he lived; and in the original text in Isaiah it is, "I have sworn by myself"; which being generally expressed, the apostle, perfectly agreeable to the meaning of it, gives the particular form of oath he swore, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>; <p>every knee shall bow to me; which is not to be understood literally of bowing of the knee at the name of Jesus, which has no foundation in this, nor in any other passage of Scripture, but figuratively, of the subjection of all creatures to Christ, both voluntary and involuntary. The Complutensian edition adds, "of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth", as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>, from whence these words seem to be taken: <p>and every tongue shall confess to God; that is, everyone that has a tongue, every man, be he who he will, a good or a bad man, shall own at the last day, that Christ is God and Lord of all; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>. It may be asked, how this passage appears to be a proof of what the apostle had asserted, for which purpose it seems to be cited, since here is nothing said of Christ, nor of his judgment seat, nor of all standing before it? to which may be returned, that it is clear from the context in the prophet, that the Messiah is the person speaking, who is said to be a just God and Saviour; and is represented as calling upon, and encouraging all sorts of persons to look to him for salvation; and as he in whom the church expected righteousness and strength, and in whom all the seed of Israel shall be justified, and shall glory; and which the Chaldee paraphrase all along interprets of , "the Word of the Lord"; the essential Word of God, the true Messiah: moreover, the bowing of the knee, and swearing, or confessing, to him, relate to his lordship and dominion over all; and suppose him as sitting on his throne of glory, as Lord of all, or as a judge on his judgment seat, in a court of judicature, where such like actions as here mentioned are performed; and whereas every knee is to bow, and every tongue to confess to him, which include all mankind, it follows then, that all the saints shall stand before him, bow unto him, own him as their Lord, and be judged by him. Kimchi says (p), that this shall be , "in the last days": and which the apostle rightly refers to the day of the general judgment. This place affords a considerable proof of Christ's true and proper deity, being in the prophet styled "Jehovah", and by the apostle "God"; and such things being ascribed to him, as swearing by himself, which no creature may do, and the subjection and confession of all creatures to him, whether they will or not. <p>(o) Apolog. 2. pro Christianis, p. 87.

(also <span class="greekheb">א</span> on the margin), <span class="greekheb">ἐξομολογήσεται</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ὀμεῖται</span>, was probably—seeing that the Septuagint has very frequently undergone similar alterations of the text from N.

The variation itself is—as was allowed by the freedom in the handling of Messianic proof-passages—intentional, because Paul required, instead of the oath of God, a more general conception, which, however, lies at the basis of that special conception; for the swearing is the actual acknowledgment and glorification of God as the Judge. The correct explanation is: and every tongue shall praise God (as the Judge), and therewith submit to His judicial authority—parallel in sense to <span class="greekheb">ἐμοὶ κάμψει πᾶν γόνυ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξομολογεῖσθαι</span> with the dative always denotes to praise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm" title="And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name.">Romans 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm" title="At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.">Matthew 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-21.htm" title="In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in your sight.">Luke 10:21</a>; frequently in the LXX. and Apocrypha, see Biel and Schleusner, s.v.): it only denotes to confess, as in later Greek, with the accusative of the object, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-6.htm" title="And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.">Matthew 3:6</a> : <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-16.htm" title="Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed.
