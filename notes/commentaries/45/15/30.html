They must pray for themselves, who would have <span class="ital">others </span>strive together with them in prayer. Of all the apostles, Paul alone is recorded as desiring the prayers of the faithful for himself; and this he generally does in the conclusions of his epistles; yet not without making a difference. For, he speaks in one manner to them whom he treats as his children, with the gravity, or even severity of a father, such as Timothy, Titus, the Corinthians, and Galatians; in another, to them whom he treats rather like equals, such as the Romans, Ephesians, Thessalonians, Colossians, Hebrews. <span class="ital">That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judea</span> — “The unbelieving Jews at Jerusalem had got notice of Paul’s success in converting the Gentiles, to whom he preached salvation, without requiring them to obey the law of Moses. And being falsely informed that <span class="ital">he taught</span> <span class="ital">all the Jews which were among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, </span>&c., (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21</a>,) they were exceedingly enraged against him.” Of this the apostle being well apprized, and knowing of what importance the preservation of his life was to the church, is thus urgent in his requests for the continued, fervent prayers of the brethren at Rome, that he might be preserved from the power of these enemies of Christ and his servants; and that his service in making the collections might be well received by the saints there. These were evidently the grand reasons why he was so earnest in desiring the prayers of the faithful for him; for, had his own personal safety alone been the object of his solicitude, independent of the prosperity of God’s work, and the salvation of the souls of the Gentiles, he doubtless would have <span class="ital">desired to depart, and be with Christ, </span>which he knew would be <span class="ital">far better </span>than remaining longer in the body, in this world of sin and sorrow. <span class="ital">That I may come unto you with joy </span>— “As the apostle proposed to visit the Romans after delivering the collections at Jerusalem, he earnestly wished that that service might be acceptable to the brethren there; because, if it was well received, it would have great influence in producing that happy union of the Jews with the Gentiles, which he had so much at heart to accomplish, and make him come to Rome in great joy. But how much he was disappointed in his generous design, and in what disadvantageous circumstances he came to Rome, the history of the Acts informs us.” See chap. 21.-26. <span class="ital">Now the God of peace </span>— Who is at peace with us, being reconciled to us in Christ, and causes us to know, by experience, that the fruit of the Spirit is peace, — even a peace passing understanding, — <span class="ital">be with you all </span>— Whether I am present or absent. <span class="ital">Amen.</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:30-33 Let us learn to value the effectual fervent prayers of the righteous. How careful should we be, lest we forfeit our interest in the love and prayers of God's praying people! If we have experienced the Spirit's love, let us not be wanting in this office of kindness for others. Those that would prevail in prayer, must strive in prayer. Those who beg the prayers of others, must not neglect to pray for themselves. And though Christ knows our state and wants perfectly, he will know them from us. As God must be sought, for restraining the ill-will of our enemies, so also for preserving and increasing the good-will of our friends. All our joy depends upon the will of God. Let us be earnest in prayer with and for each other, that for Christ's sake, and by the love of the Holy Spirit, great blessings may come upon the souls of Christians, and the labours of ministers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the Lord Jesus Christ's sake - Greek, By or through &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;  dia our Lord Jesus Christ; It means probably out of love and regard to him; in order to promote his honor and glory, and to extend his kingdom among people.

I beseech you now to manifest that love by praying earnestly for me.<p>That ye strive together with me - That you unite with me in earnest prayer. The word "strive" denotes intense "agony" or effort, such as was used by the wrestlers in the Greek games; and then the "agony," or strong effort, which a man makes in prayer, who is earnestly desirous to be heard. The use of the word here denotes Paul's earnest desire that they should make an "intense" effort in their prayers that he might be delivered. Christians, though at a distance from each other, may unite their prayers for a common object. Christians everywhere "should" wrestle in prayer for the ministers of the gospel, that they may be kept from temptations; and especially for those who are engaged, as the apostle was, in arduous efforts among the pagan, that they may be kept from the many dangers to which they are exposed in their journeying in pagan lands. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30.

Having declared his intention of coming to them, and his confidence of it, he entreats an interest in their prayers; and which he urges from the consideration of their mutual relation as "brethren"; and therefore should love one another, and show it, among other things, by praying for each other to their common parent, in whom they have a joint interest, saying, as directed by Christ, "our Father which art in heaven", <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>; thereby signifying, that they prayed not for themselves only, but for all the brethren, all the children of God: and this the apostle further urges, <p>for Christ's sake; whose servant he was, and in whose cause he was engaged, whose Gospel he preached, and whose glory he sought; and therefore, if they had any regard for Christ, and the good of his interest, he beseeches them that they would pray for the continuance of his life and usefulness; since for him to live was for the good of the churches of Christ, though for him to die would be his own personal gain: and which he also stirs them up to, <p>for the love of the Spirit; meaning either the love of the Father, and of the Son, which was shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit, which he had directed them into, and they had a comfortable sensation of; or that love to God, to Christ, and one another, which the Spirit of God had wrought in them in regeneration; or that love with which the Spirit of God equally loved them, as the Father, and the Son; and which he had shown in their conversion and sanctification, in applying all grace unto them, and indwelling in them as the Spirit of adoption, and as the earnest and pledge of the heavenly inheritance. <p>That ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me. The apostle prayed for himself, as he had been wont to do ever since he was a converted man; but knowing well the force of united social prayer, he desires the assistance of others. He represents prayer as an agony, an holy conflict, and striving with God, a wrestling with him, as Jacob did, who held him, and would not let him go without the blessing, and had power with him, and prevailed. The phrase denotes the fervency of prayer, the strength, labour, and energy of it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>; and also intimates, that the apostle foresaw he should have a combat with many enemies where he was going, and should be in great danger by them; and therefore desires they would join him in the use of their spiritual armour, and in that particular part of it, prayer, which has been often used to good purpose against the enemies of the Gospel: he does not desire these Romans to beg the assistance of their senate or emperor: but to pray to God for him, and join with him in their prayers to him, who is a God hearing prayer, and able to save.

Prayer is a <span class="ital">striving</span>, or <span class="ital">contest</span>, especially when men resist. Paul is the only one of the apostles, who asks for himself the prayers of believers. He does this moreover generally at the conclusion of his epistles, but not indiscriminately so in all. For he does not so write to those, whom he treats as sons, with the dignity of a father, or even with severity, for example, Timothy, Titus, the Corinthians, the Galatians, as he does to those, whom he treats as his equals with the deferential regard of a brother, for example, the Thessalonians, Ephesians, Colossians (with whom he had not been), and therefore so also the Romans and likewise the Hebrews. It [the request for their prayers] is introduced with great elegance at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="You also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed on us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-22.htm" title="But with prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.">Philemon 1:22</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30-33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; that I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints.</span> Here he seems to imply a possibility of even the Jewish Christians not receiving him, with the alms he brought them, kindly. In 2 Oct. 8:18, <span class="accented">seq</span>., he had shown signs of being anxious to avoid any possible suspicion of malversation with regard to the contribution. The danger probably arose from the suspicions against himself, his authority, and his motives, entertained by the Judaistic faction. That this faction was then strong at Jerusalem appears from the precautions he was advised to take on his arrival there (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20-24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.
