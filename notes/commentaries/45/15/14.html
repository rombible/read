The greetings at the end are naturally introduced by a few words of explanation as to the way in which the more general exhortations that preceded are to be received by the Roman Christians, and a somewhat longer statement on the part of the Apostle of his own relations to the Church at Rome. This might seem to be the more necessary as the Church was not one of his own founding, and he might seem to be both going out of his way and acting in contradiction to his own principles in writing to them at all.<p>I write thus to you though you do not really need all these exhortations. Not only do others tell me, but I am convinced myself that you possess all the qualifications which would fit you to teach others instead of receiving instruction yourselves.<p><span class= "bld">Ye also.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">even yourselves,</span> as you are, and without any stimulus or incitement given to you from without.<p><span class= "bld">Goodness</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> goodness of disposition, readiness to practise all the Christian virtues, especially those to which the last section had been exhorting.<p><span class= "bld">Knowledge</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of the doctrinal aspects of Christianity as they had been set forth in the earlier portion of the Epistle. No doubt the Apostle had really much to teach his readers—he does not say that he had not—but he courteously gives them credit for all they knew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/15-14.htm" title="And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another....">Romans 15:14-17</a></span>. <span class="ital">And I myself am persuaded of you </span>— The apology which the apostle here offers for writing to a church with which he was not personally acquainted was the more necessary, because, in his letter, he had opposed some of their strongest prejudices, and had rebuked them for certain irregularities in their conduct. But he was entitled to instruct and reprove them, by virtue of his apostolic office, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm" title="Nevertheless, brothers, I have written the more boldly to you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,">Romans 15:15</a>;) the truth of which he proved by his success in converting the Gentiles; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost....">Romans 15:16-17</a>;) and by the miracles he had wrought among them, and by the gifts of the Spirit he had communicated to his converts, in all the Gentile countries which he had visited. <span class="ital">That ye </span>— Some among you, by being created anew; <span class="ital">are full of goodness </span>— Of kindness, so as to forbear giving unnecessary offence to, or censuring one another; <span class="ital">filled with all knowledge </span>— A large measure of knowledge in all needful points, through your long experience in the ways of God; <span class="ital">able also to admonish </span>— To instruct, and confirm; <span class="ital">one another </span>— In all things of importance. There are several conclusions of this epistle: the first begins at this verse; the second, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>; the third, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-17.htm" title="I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.">Romans 15:17</a>; the fourth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-21.htm" title="But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.">Romans 15:21</a>; and the fifth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm" title="But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.">Romans 15:25</a>. <span class="ital">Nevertheless, brethren </span>— Notwithstanding your grace and knowledge; <span class="ital">I have written the more boldly unto you </span>— Have used the greater freedom and plainness in writing; <span class="ital">in some sort — </span><span class="greekheb">Απο μερους</span>, <span class="ital">in part, </span>or partly; <span class="ital">as putting you in mind </span>— That is, setting before you, and inciting you to the practice of what you know already; <span class="ital">because of the grace that is given to me </span>— That is, because I am constituted an apostle of the Gentiles. Whitby thinks, that by the expression, <span class="ital">in part, </span>in the former clause of the verse, the apostle meant to signify <span class="ital">the Gentile part </span>of the Church of Rome to whom he wrote, to put them in mind of God’s great goodness to them. But it seems more probable he intended thereby to insinuate, that his design in writing was, besides calling things to their remembrance which they knew, to instruct them in some things which they did not know. <span class="ital">That I should be the minister </span>— The servant; <span class="ital">of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering, </span>preaching, <span class="ital">the gospel of God </span>— In order to their conversion and edification; <span class="ital">that the offering up of the Gentiles </span>— To him, as living sacrifices; <span class="ital">might be acceptable </span>— In his sight; <span class="ital">being sanctified by the Holy Ghost </span>— Plentifully communicated to them, not only in a rich variety of gifts, but in his regenerating, purifying, and comforting influences; making them wise and good, holy toward God, and useful to their fellow-creatures. <span class="ital">I have therefore — </span>Having, by the blessing of God upon my labours, been instrumental in converting many of them, <span class="ital">whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ </span>— In and through whom all my glorying is; <span class="ital">in those things which pertain to God </span>— In the success of my ministry, wherein the glory of God is so much concerned. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:14-21 The apostle was persuaded that the Roman Christians were filled with a kind and affectionate spirit, as well as with knowledge. He had written to remind them of their duties and their dangers, because God had appointed him the minister of Christ to the Gentiles. Paul preached to them; but what made them sacrifices to God, was, their sanctification; not his work, but the work of the Holy Ghost: unholy things can never be pleasing to the holy God. The conversion of souls pertains unto God; therefore it is the matter of Paul's glorying, not the things of the flesh. But though a great preacher, he could not make one soul obedient, further than the Spirit of God accompanied his labours. He principally sought the good of those that sat in darkness. Whatever good we do, it is Christ who does it by us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I myself also - The apostle here proceeds to show them why he had written this Epistle, and to state his confidence in them. He had exhorted them to peace; he had opposed some of their strongest prejudices; and in order to secure their obedience to his injunctions, he now shows them the deep interest which he had in their welfare, though he had never seen them.<p>Am persuaded - He had never seen them <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-10.htm">Romans 1:10-13</a>, but he had full confidence in them. This confidence he had expressed more fully in the first chapter.<p>Of you - Concerning you. I have full confidence in you.<p>My brethren - An address of affection; showing that he was not disposed to assume undue authority, or to lord it over their faith.<p>Are full of goodness - Filled with "kindness" or "benevolence." That is, they were "disposed" to obey any just commands; and that consequently any errors in their opinions and conduct had not been the effect of obstinacy or perverseness. There was indeed danger in the city of Rome of pride and haughtiness; and among the Gentile converts there might have been some reluctance to receive instruction from a foreign Jew. But the apostle was persuaded that all this was overcome by the mild and humbling spirit of religion, and that they were disposed to obey any just commands. He made this observation, therefore, to conciliate respect to his authority as an apostle.<p>Filled with all knowledge - That is, instructed in the doctrines and duties of the Christian religion. This was true; but there might be still some comparatively unimportant and nonessential points, on which they might not be entirely clear. On these, the apostle had written; and written, not professedly to communicate "new" ideas, but to "remind" them of the great principles on which they were before instructed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>.<p>Able also ... - That is, you are so fully instructed in Christian principles, as to be able to give advice and counsel, if it is needed. From this verse we may learn,<p>(1) That when it is our duty to give instruction, admonition, or advice, it should be in a kind, conciliating manner; not with harshness, or with the severity of authority. Even "an apostle" did not assume harshness or severity in his instructions.<p>(2) there is no impropriety in speaking of the good qualities of Christians in their presence; or even of "commending" and "praising" them when they deserve it.<p>The apostle Paul was as far as possible from always dwelling on the faults of Christians. When it was necessary to reprove them, he did it, but did it with tenderness and tears. When he "could" commend, he preferred it; and never hesitated to give them credit to the utmost extent to which it could be rendered. He did not "flatter," but he told the truth; he did not commend to excite pride and vanity, but to encourage, and to prompt to still more active efforts. The minister who always censures and condemns, whose ministry is made up of complaints and lamentations, who never speaks of Christians but in a strain of fault-finding, is unlike the example of the Saviour and of Paul, and may expect little success in his work; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-19.htm">Romans 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm">1 Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-7.htm">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-9.htm">Hebrews 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-12.htm">2 Peter 1:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ro 15:14-33. Conclusion: In Which the Apostle Apologizes for Thus Writing to the Roman Christians, Explains Why He Had Not Yet Visited Them, Announces His Future Plans, and Asks Their Prayers for the Completion of Them.<p>14, 15. And, &c.&#8212;rather, "Now I am persuaded, my brethren, even I myself, concerning you"<p>that ye also yourselves are full of goodness&#8212;of inclination to all I have been enjoining on you<p>filled with all knowledge&#8212;of the truth expounded<p>and able&#8212;without my intervention.<p>to admonish one another.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here begins the epilogue or conclusion of this excellent Epistle, wherein the apostle makes an apology, first for his manner of writing to them, and then for his not coming to them himself. His first apology is ushered in with a singular commendation of the Christians at Rome; he began with their commendation, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a></span>, and he ends with the same. There are three things which he commends them for. The first is their <span class="ital">goodness; </span> thus it is numbered among <span class="ital">the</span> <span class="ital">fruits of the Spirit, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a></span>. It may be taken more largely, and so it comprehends all grace and virtue; or else more strictly, and so it is put for kindness, gentleness, and charity, in forbearing and forgiving others. The second is <span class="ital">all knowledge; </span> i.e. in things necessary, or in matters relating to Christian liberly; or, by <span class="ital">all</span> <span class="ital">knowledge, </span> he means a large measure and proportion of it. The third is ability <span class="ital">to admonish one another, </span> to inform others in things about which they were ignorant, or it reprehend others for things about which they were negligent. Though there were many weak and ignorant persons among them, yet there were others of whom he was persuaded and fully assured they were thus qualified: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;">1 Corinthians 1:5</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I myself also am persuaded of you,.... This is said by way of prevention to an objection that might he made to the apostle's prayers and exhortations by the Romans. What does the apostle mean by all this? what does he think of us, or take us to be? men that live in malice to one another, devoid of all humanity, and mutual respect? a parcel of fools and ignorant men, that know nothing of divine things? and though there may be some that are much to be blamed for their conduct and carriage to their fellow Christians, what, are there none among us fit to give advice and admonition? To which the apostle replies, that he was far from entertaining such thoughts of them; that though he had not seen them in person, yet he had had such an account of their faith and practice, which were famous throughout the world, that he was thoroughly persuaded of better things of them, though he thus spake; and therefore, to mollify them, and abate their resentment, he adds, <p>my brethren; testifying his affection to them, owning the spiritual relation they stood in to him, and declaring the great esteem he had for them, and the high opinion he had of them: saying, <p>that ye also are full of goodness; not naturally, for there is no good thing in men by nature, but what they had was from the Spirit of God, whose fruit is "goodness": and by which may be meant, either the good gifts of the Spirit of God, or rather his graces, even the good work of grace in general, and which is goodness itself: it comes from a good cause, the good Spirit of God; is good in its own nature, not having the least mixture or tincture of evil in it; and good in its effects, since it makes and denominates a man a good man; now these saints might be said to be full of this, to denote the abundance, the superabundance of grace in this work: or particularly beneficence, humanity, and sympathy to fellow Christians, may be intended. The Vulgate Latin version reads, "full of love": but the copies and eastern versions read as we do. <p>Filled with all knowledge; not with every sort of knowledge, with the knowledge of all languages, or of all the arts and sciences, of all things, natural and political; but with all spiritual knowledge relating to God, his nature and perfections, his mind and will; to Christ and the work of redemption by him; to the Spirit, and the operations of his grace; to the Gospel, and the doctrines of it; to their duty to God, fellow creatures, and fellow Christians; in short, with all knowledge necessary to salvation, though as yet not perfect, and which will not be in this world, but in another: <p>able also to admonish one another; as they must be, since they were both good and knowing; goodness and knowledge are necessary to admonition, and qualify persons for it: if a man is not a good man himself, he is not fit to admonish another; and if he has not knowledge, he will not be able to do it as it should be; and without humanity and tenderness, he will not perform it aright, and with success; but all this being in these persons, they were able and fit for it. Some copies read it, "able also to admonish others"; so the Syriac version renders; which makes the expression still stronger, and enlarges their praise and commendation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</span><p>(8) The conclusion of the epistle, in which he first excuses himself, that he has written somewhat at length to them, rather to warn them than to teach them, and that of necessity, by reason of his calling, which binds him in a special way to the Gentiles.<p>(l) Of your own accord, and by yourselves.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-14.htm" title="And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brothers, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.">Romans 15:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πέπεισμαι δέ</span>] <span class="ital">but I am of the conviction;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-14.htm" title="I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.">Romans 14:14</a>.

This, again, may refer to the comprehension of Christianity shown by the strong of chap. 14: or it may be intended to apologise for the unusually doctrinal character of the epistle. Both <span class="greekheb">μεστοί</span> and <span class="greekheb">πεπληρωμένοι</span> occur also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm" title="Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,">Romans 1:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">δυνάμενοι κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλήλους νουθετεῖν</span>: in a sense therefore self-sufficient.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14–21</span>.

What St Paul says here is in no insincere diplomatic compliment, but the well-grounded conviction of his mind as to the Roman Christians <span class="ital">as a body</span>. And it is quite in harmony with the substance and tone of the Epistle, which is evidently written for those who were no novices in Christian doctrine, and who were also comparatively free from such faults of Christian practice as defiled, for instance, the Corinthian Church. He wrote to them as he had written just because they were in a state of spiritual vigour and maturity. Perhaps too, he instinctively <span class="ital">expresses</span> this conviction the more strongly, because he is writing to the Church of the imperial Metropolis, the mighty Centre of influence.
