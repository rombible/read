The words “of the gospel” should be omitted. By “the fulness of the blessing of Christ” the Apostle means the full or abundant measure of those spiritual blessings which he, as the Minister and Apostle of Christ, was commissioned to impart to them.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:22-29 The apostle sought the things of Christ more than his own will, and would not leave his work of planting churches to go to Rome. It concerns all to do that first which is most needful. We must not take it ill if our friends prefer work which is pleasing to God, before visits and compliments, which may please us. It is justly expected from all Christians, that they should promote every good work, especially that blessed work, the conversion of souls. Christian society is a heaven upon earth, an earnest of our gathering together unto Christ at the great day. Yet it is but partial, compared with our communion with Christ; for that only will satisfy the soul. The apostle was going to Jerusalem, as the messenger of charity. God loves a cheerful giver. Every thing that passes between Christians should be a proof and instance of the union they have in Jesus Christ. The Gentiles received the gospel of salvation from the Jews; therefore were bound to minister to them in what was needed for the body. Concerning what he expected from them he speaks doubtfully; but concerning what he expected from God he speaks confidently. We cannot expect too little from man, nor too much from God. And how delightful and advantageous it is to have the gospel with the fulness of its blessings! What wonderful and happy effects does it produce, when attended with the power of the Spirit!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am sure - Greek, I know; expressing the fullest confidence, a confidence that was greatly confirmed by the success of his labors elsewhere.<p>In the fulness of the blessings ... - This is a Hebrew mode of expression, where one noun performs the purpose of an adjective, and means "with a full or abundant blessing." This confidence he, expressed in other language in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11-12</a>; see the notes.<p>Of the gospel of Christ - Which the gospel of Christ is suited to impart. Thus, every minister of the gospel should wish to go. This should be his everburning desire in preaching. Paul went to Rome; but he went in bonds; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>; 28. But though he went in this manner, he was permitted there to preach the gospel for at least two years, nor can we doubt that his ministry was attended with the anticipated success; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-30.htm">Acts 28:30-31</a>. God may disappoint us in regard to the "mode" in which we purpose to do good; but if we really desire it, he will enable us to do it in "his own way." It "may" be better to preach the gospel in "bonds" than at liberty; it "is" better to do it even in a prison, than not at all. Bunyan wrote the Pilgrim's Progress to amuse his heavy hours during a twelve years' cruel imprisonment. If he had been at liberty, he probably would not have written it at all. The great desire of his heart was accomplished, but a "prison" was the place in which to do it. Paul preached; but preached in chains. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

Nor was the apostle mistaken in this confidence, though his visit to Rome was in very different circumstances from what he expected.

He intended to go to Spain; he was not sure he should reach thither; but he was positive in it he should come to Rome. It had been much and long upon his mind; and under an impress of the Spirit of God upon him, he had signified some time before this, that after he had been at Jerusalem, he "must see, Rome also", <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-21.htm">Acts 19:21</a>, and it was afterwards more expressly told him by the Lord, that as he had testified of him at Jerusalem, he should bear witness at Rome also,  <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>, and therefore he was fully assured he should come to Rome, and was as confident of the manner of his coming thither. <p>I shall come in, or "with" <p>the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ; with the Gospel, the good news of salvation by Christ; and which must make him a welcome person to every sensible soul wherever he came; to this he was chosen, separated, and called; for this he was abundantly qualified; this was committed to his trust, and which he carried with him wherever he went: and he was not ashamed of it, and was ready to preach it even at Rome also. With "the Gospel of Christ"; not his own, or another's, or any man's, but Christ's, which he had by the revelation of Christ; of which Christ is the sum and substance, and which Christ himself preached; "with the blessing of the Gospel of Christ". Some by "blessing" understand a liberal contribution, which he trusted he should make at Rome, for the poor saints at Jerusalem; believing that their hearts would be opened, under the preaching of the Gospel, to give freely to them, and that this would be a blessing that would attend it: but rather he means, either the blessed gifts he had, qualifying him for preaching the Gospel, with which he should come and deliver it among them, and which would attend it with success; such as boldness of spirit, freedom of speech, enlarged knowledge, mighty signs and wonders, and the demonstration of the Spirit, and of power: or the blessed effects it would have on them, in establishing them in the present truths; in further enlightening and instructing their minds; in edifying, quickening, and comforting them; and in nourishing up with the words of faith and sound doctrine, unto eternal life: or the blessings of grace exhibited and set forth in the Gospel; such as justification and forgiveness of sins, peace and reconciliation, salvation and eternal life. Nay, he believed he should come in, or with the "fulness" of all this; meaning, either that he believed he should find them full of the Gospel, and the fruits of it; or rather that he should come full fraught with it, and fully preach it to them, and keep back thing that would be profitable. There is a fulness in the Gospel; it is full of the deep things of God, which the Spirit searches and reveals, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>; it is full of the doctrines of grace and truth, which Christ himself is said to be full of, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, it is full of exceeding great and precious promises transcribed from Christ, and out of the covenant of grace; and it is full of a variety of food, of milk for babes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-13.htm">Hebrews 5:13</a>, and meat for strong persons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>.
