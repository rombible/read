It concerns all to do that first which is most needful. We must not take it ill if our friends prefer work which is pleasing to God, before visits and compliments, which may please us. It is justly expected from all Christians, that they should promote every good work, especially that blessed work, the conversion of souls. Christian society is a heaven upon earth, an earnest of our gathering together unto Christ at the great day. Yet it is but partial, compared with our communion with Christ; for that only will satisfy the soul. The apostle was going to Jerusalem, as the messenger of charity. God loves a cheerful giver. Every thing that passes between Christians should be a proof and instance of the union they have in Jesus Christ. The Gentiles received the gospel of salvation from the Jews; therefore were bound to minister to them in what was needed for the body. Concerning what he expected from them he speaks doubtfully; but concerning what he expected from God he speaks confidently. We cannot expect too little from man, nor too much from God. And how delightful and advantageous it is to have the gospel with the fulness of its blessings! What wonderful and happy effects does it produce, when attended with the power of the Spirit!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But now I go ... - I am about to go now. The mention of this intended journey to Jerusalem is introduced in several other places, and is so mentioned that Dr. Paley has derived from it a very strong argument for the genuineness of this Epistle.  This intended journey is mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-21.htm">Acts 19:21</a>, "Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying after I have been there, I must also see Rome;" see also <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm">Acts 20:2-3</a>.

To this he answers, that for the present he could not come, because he had a weighty affair upon his hands, which was to go up to Jerusalem to minister to the saints; i.e. to carry thither certain collections and contributions from the Gentile churches for their relief. He useth a participle of the present tense in the original, to show that this work is now in hand, and it would not stay or hold him long. Though indeed his work was to preach the gospel, and not to serve tables; yet it seems likely that the churches of the Gentiles, who were moved by him to this contribution, had committed the same to his care, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take on us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.">2 Corinthians 8:4</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But now I go unto Jerusalem,.... Whither he was bound in spirit, not knowing what should befall him there, from which he could not be dissuaded by his friends, and thither he did go: <p>to minister unto the saints; not to preach the Gospel, though doubtless he did that when he was there; but to distribute among the poor saints what had been raised for them by the Greek churches; who had entreated him to take upon him this service, even the fellowship of ministering to the saints; and though this might seem below his office as an apostle, and as what more became an inferior officer, a deacon in a church; yet the apostle's heart was so much in it, and he was so bent upon it, and so diligent to execute it, that he postponed his journey to Spain and visit to Rome for the sake of it, and assigns this as a reason why he could not come at present. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But now I go unto Jerusalem to <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> minister unto the saints.</span><p>(p) Doing his duty for the saints, to carry to them that money which was gathered for their use.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm" title="But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.">Romans 15:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">Νυνὶ δέ</span>] is not, like the above <span class="greekheb">νυνὶ δέ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-23.htm" title="But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come to you;">Romans 15:23</a>), to be regarded as <span class="ital">resumptive</span>, as Buttmann and Hofmann, in consequence of the reading <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίξω γάρ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-24.htm" title="Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.">Romans 15:24</a>, take it,—a view with which what was previously said of the journey to Spain by way of Rome does not accord,[29] and the passage itself assumes a very stiff, contorted form.
