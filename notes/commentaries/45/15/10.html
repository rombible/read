The sense of the Hebrew is disputed. That which appears to suit the context best—“Rejoice, O ye nations of His people,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Jewish tribes—is questioned on the ground of linguistic usage. In place of this, we may either adopt the rendering of the Vulgate—“Ye nations (Gentiles) praise His people,” or, “Rejoice, ye nations (Gentiles), who are His people.” This, however, hardly seems to fall in with the context so well.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:8-13 Christ fulfilled the prophecies and promises relating to the Jews, and the Gentile converts could have no excuse for despising them. The Gentiles, being brought into the church, are companions in patience and tribulation. They should praise God. Calling upon all the nations to praise the Lord, shows that they shall have knowledge of him. We shall never seek to Christ till we trust in him. And the whole plan of redemption is suited to reconcile us to one another, as well as to our gracious God, so that an abiding hope of eternal life, through the sanctifying and comforting power of the Holy Spirit, may be attained. Our own power will never reach this; therefore where this hope is, and is abounding, the blessed Spirit must have all the glory. All joy and peace; all sorts of true joy and peace, so as to suppress doubts and fears, through the powerful working of the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And again ... - ; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>. In this place the "nations" or Gentiles are called on to rejoice with the Jews, for the interposition of God in their behalf. The design of the quotation is to show that the Old Testament speaks of the Gentiles as called on to celebrate the praises of God; of course, the apostle infers that they are to be introduced to the same privileges as his people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

Here it is evidently implied, that the Gentiles should become the people of God, and join with the Jews in his worship and service, and rejoice in the sense of his goodness and mercy to them. The partition wall is now taken away, and they both became one sheepfold under one Shepherd. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And again he saith,.... God or Christ, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>; <p>rejoice ye Gentiles with his people; which from the Hebrew text are by some rendered, "rejoice his people O ye Gentiles"; to which agree the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan, who render it, "praise O ye nations his people"; or as some copies of the former, "the judgment of his people"; and the latter adds, the house of Israel. The note of R. Sol. Jarchi on the text is, <p>"at that time the nations shall praise Israel; see what is the praise of this people that cleave unto the Lord, &amp;c.'' <p>But the design of this song is to praise God, and not the people of Israel; who in it are severely reproved for their many iniquities, and especially their very great ingratitude to God, and are threatened with the heaviest judgments. This is seen by other Jewish writers, who interpret the words accordingly, as R. Aben Ezra does, whose note is <p>"then shall they praise him, when God shall avenge their blood;'' <p>and to this sense is the Jerusalem Targum, <p>"praise before him O ye people, praise him O his people of the house of Israel;'' <p>but the words may be better translated either thus, "rejoice O ye nations, his people"; that is, ye Gentiles who are his people, whom God has taken into his covenant, and whom he will declare as such in his own time, which time was now come, and therefore had reason to rejoice; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>; or thus, "rejoice ye Gentiles, and his people"; let both Jews and Gentiles rejoice; let them rejoice together when they come to be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of the same promises and privileges; when they shall be together in one fold, under one shepherd; and especially when the fulness of each of them is brought in, and God has avenged himself of his and their enemies; and which agrees with the apostle's sense, and whose version is supported by the Septuagint interpreters; and his supplement is to be justified, there only wanting a copulative in the Hebrew text, which is often the case in that language, and which may easily be supplied by "and" or "with"; as it is with the latter by the apostle, in perfect agreement with the sense of the words. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-10.htm" title="And again he said, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.">Romans 15:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πάλιν</span>] <span class="ital">Again</span>, namely, in another passage containing the same thing.

Luther: “all ye who are His people”), since גוֹיִם cannot denote the tribes of the Jewish people; but, as the Hiphil הַרְנִינוּ allows, either with the Vulgate: “laudate, gentes, populum ejus” (so Gesenius, Thes. I. p. 272, and Umbreit, p. 358; comp. Kamphausen, Lied Mos. p. 219 f.); or: “make to shout for joy, ye Gentiles, His people,” which, however, does not fit the connection; or (with Aquila and Theodotion, comp. Hofmann), Shout for joy, ye Gentiles, ye who are His people. The latter is to be preferred, because הִרְנִין in the sense of Kal, in the few passages where it is so found, is not joined with the accusative, but either is joined with the dative (לְ)—as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-2.htm" title="Take a psalm, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.">Psalm 81:2</a>—or stands absolutely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-11.htm" title="Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, you righteous: and shout for joy, all you that are upright in heart.">Psalm 32:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-10.htm" title="And again he said, Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.">Romans 15:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ πάλιν λέγει</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-43.htm" title="Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.">Deuteronomy 32:43</a>, LXX.
