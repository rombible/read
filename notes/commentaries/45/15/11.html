The Gentiles, being brought into the church, are companions in patience and tribulation. They should praise God. Calling upon all the nations to praise the Lord, shows that they shall have knowledge of him. We shall never seek to Christ till we trust in him. And the whole plan of redemption is suited to reconcile us to one another, as well as to our gracious God, so that an abiding hope of eternal life, through the sanctifying and comforting power of the Holy Spirit, may be attained. Our own power will never reach this; therefore where this hope is, and is abounding, the blessed Spirit must have all the glory. All joy and peace; all sorts of true joy and peace, so as to suppress doubts and fears, through the powerful working of the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And again - <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>. The object in this quotation is the same as before. The apostle accumulates quotations to show that it was the common language of the Old Testament, and that he was not depending on a single expression for the truth of his doctrine.<p>All ye Gentiles - In the psalm, "all ye nations;" but the original is the same.<p>And laud him - "Praise" him. The psalm is directly in point. It is a call on "all" nations to praise God; the very point in the discussion of the apostle. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

It is written in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>, <p>praise the Lord all ye Gentiles, and laud him all ye people; that is, praise him both Jews and Gentiles, for his merciful kindness and truth, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-2.htm">Romans 15:2</a>; the Gentiles for his mercy in choosing, redeeming, and calling them, as before; and the Jews for his truth and faithfulness in the fulfilment of his praises. R. David Kimchi on this psalm observes, that <p>"it consists of two verses only, and that it belongs , "to the days of the Messiah"; and intimates, by the composition of it in two verses only, that all people shall be divided into two parts, or be on two sides, Israel shall be in their law, and all the nations in seven precepts,'' <p>i.e. of Noah. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-11.htm" title="And again, Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; and laud him, all you people.">Romans 15:11</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/117-1.htm" title="O praise the LORD, all you nations: praise him, all you people.">Psalm 117:1</a> (closely following the LXX., but see the critical notes) contains a twofold parallel summons to the praise of God, addressed to all <span class="ital">Gentile peoples</span>.[17] In this case <span class="greekheb">αἰνεῖν</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΑΙΝΕῖΝ</span></span></span> are not different in <span class="ital">degree</span> (Philippi), but only in form, like <span class="ital">praise</span> and <span class="ital">bepraise</span> [<span class="ital">loben</span> and <span class="ital">beloben</span>].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[17] The Messianic fulfilment of this summons is recognised by Paul in the magnifying of God on the part of the Gentiles <span class="ital">converted to Christ</span> from all nations.
