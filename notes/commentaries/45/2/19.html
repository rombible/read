A believing, humble, thankful glorying in God, is the root and sum of all religion. But proud, vain-glorious boasting in God, and in the outward profession of his name, is the root and sum of all hypocrisy. Spiritual pride is the most dangerous of all kinds of pride. A great evil of the sins professors is, the dishonour done to God and religion, by their not living according to their profession. Many despise their more ignorant neighbours who rest in a dead form of godliness; yet themselves trust in a form of knowledge, equally void of life and power, while some glory in the gospel, whose unholy lives dishonour God, and cause his name to be blasphemed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And art confident - This expression denotes the full assurance of the Jew that he was superior in knowledge to all other people. It is a remarkable fact that the Jews put the fullest confidence in their religion. Though proud, wicked, and hypocritical, yet they were not speculative infidels. It was one of their characteristics, evinced through all their history, that they had the fullest assurance that God was the author of their institutions, and that their religion was his appointment.<p>A guide of the blind - A guide of the blind is a figurative expression to denote an instructor of the ignorant. The blind here properly refers to the Gentiles, who were thus regarded by the Jews. The meaning is, that they esteemed themselves qualified to instruct the pagan world; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15</a>.<p>A light - Another figurative expression to denote a teacher; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-8.htm">John 1:8-9</a>.<p>In darkness - A common expression to denote the ignorance of the Gentile world; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-16.htm">Matthew 4:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. approvest the things that are excellent&#8212;"triest the things that differ" (Margin).

Gospel ministers best deserve this title: <p>a light of them that are in darkness; so Christ, John the Baptist, the disciples of Christ, and all Gospel ministers are; but these men, who arrogated such characters to themselves, were dim lights, and dark lanterns. The apostle seems to have respect to those very high and exalted characters the Jews give of their doctors, as when they call one, , "the lamp of light" (w); another,  "the holy lamps" (x); and a third, , "the lamp of Israel" (y); with many others of the same kind; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a> and See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>. <p>(w) T.

(<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-1.htm" title="How long will you forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long will you hide your face from me?">Psalm 13:1</a>, LXX), persons without moral intelligence.

The confidence of the Jew is based on the fact that he possesses in the law “the outline of knowledge and truth”. Lipsius puts a strong sense upon <span class="greekheb">μόρφωσιν</span>—die leibhaftige Verkörperung: as if the Jew conceived that in the Mosaic law the knowledge and the truth of God were incorporated bodily. Possibly he did, and in a sense it was so, for the Mosaic law was a true revelation of God and His will: but the only other instance of <span class="greekheb">μόρφωσις</span> in the N.T. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm" title="Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.">2 Timothy 3:5</a> <span class="greekheb">ἔχοντες μόρφωσιν εὐσεβείας</span>) rather suggests the same disparaging note which here belongs to <span class="greekheb">πέποιθας</span>. The <span class="greekheb">μόρφωσις τῆς γνώσεως</span> is in point of fact only a form: valuable as the outline or definition of truth was, which the Jew possessed in the law, it was in reality ineffective, so far as the practical authority of the law in the Jew’s conduct was concerned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">thou thyself</span>] Strongly emphatic.
