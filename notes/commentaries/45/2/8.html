At the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm" title="To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life:">Romans 2:7</a> is an accusative “(he will render) eternal life;” here we have the nominative, “(there shall be) tribulation and anguish.”<p><span class= "bld">That are contentious.</span>—An error in the Authorised version through a wrong derivation of the word. Strictly, <span class= "ital">To those who act in the spirit of a hireling;</span> hence, according to the secondary meaning of the word, “to those who act in a spirit of factiousness and self-seeking.” It is, however, quite possible that the mistaken derivation may have been current in St. Paul’s time, as it was, no doubt, somewhat later, from Origen downwards. St. Paul, it is true, distinguishes between the proper word for “contention” and that used here (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>), but this would not exclude, it would rather seem to imply, not indeed a formal derivation, but some association of ideas. The shade of meaning will, perhaps, be expressed if we translate by some such word as “factiousness.” So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-16.htm" title="The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:">Philippians 1:16</a> (properly <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-17.htm" title="But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.">Philippians 1:17</a>, the order of the clauses being reversed), “the one (<span class= "ital">the other</span>) preach Christ of factiousness.”<p><span class= "bld">Indignation and wrath.</span>—The Greek equivalents for these two words are distinguished as the settled angry feeling from the passionate outbreak of anger.<p><span class= "bld">The</span> <span class= "bld">truth.</span>—Here used in a moral sense, as almost equivalent to “rectitude,” “that which is right.” There is a tendency towards this meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>, “Who hold down the truth in unrighteousness,” though there “the truth” appears to mean rather “natural religion” in general. The ethical sense comes out clearly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm" title="But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.">John 3:21</a>, “he that doeth truth,” opposed to “he that doeth evil.” These phrases, “obey the truth,” “obey unrighteousness,” in a plainer style, would be simply “do good,” “do evil.” It may be noted that St. Paul is fond of these quasi-personifications.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,...">Romans 2:8-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">But unto them that are contentious </span>— Like thee, O Jew, who thus fightest against God. The character of the unbelieving Jews was disobedience, stubbornness, and impatience. Mr. Locke thinks the original expression, <span class="greekheb">οι δε εξ εριθειας</span>, <span class="ital">the contentions, </span>here spoken of, are Jews who refused to obey the gospel. “But as the apostle is speaking of the punishment of the wicked Gentiles, as well as of the wicked Jews, <span class="greekheb">εριθεια</span>, <span class="ital">contention, </span>must be a vice common to both. Accordingly, <span class="greekheb">εριθειαι</span>, <span class="ital">contentions, </span>are mentioned among <span class="ital">the works of the flesh, </span>to which wicked men in general are addicted, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>. And Suidas tells us, that <span class="greekheb">εριθεια</span>, <span class="ital">contention, </span>is <span class="greekheb">η δια λογου φιλονεικια</span>, <span class="ital">contention by words, by keen disputing. </span>Wherefore the <span class="ital">contentious </span>are persons who spread evil principles, and maintain them by keen disputings. This was the vice of many of the heathen, who disputed themselves into a disbelief of the plainest principles of morality, and argued even in support of atheism. Agreeably to this account of <span class="ital">the contentious, </span>the apostle represents them here as enemies of the truth, and as friends of unrighteousness.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Who obey not the truth </span>— Both those who did not walk according to the light of nature, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm" title="For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;">Romans 1:18</a>, and those who disobeyed the gospel, are here intended. The former, because, as truth is here opposed to unrighteousness, it must signify not only the truths discovered by revelation, but those likewise respecting religion and morality, which are discoverable by the light of nature, and which, among the heathen, were the only foundations of a virtuous conduct.

This being so, they that are here said <span class="ital">not to obey the truth </span>seem to be especially, first, the unbelieving Jews, and, secondly, the Gentiles, who spake against the truth, and rejected it. And both these obeyed, and gave themselves up to error and falsehood; the Gentiles by changing the truth of God into a lie, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.

And it is introduced with great propriety. Their having been trained up in the true religion, and their having had Christ and his apostles first sent to them, were circumstances which placed them in the foremost rank of the criminals that obeyed not the truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It must be observed, however, that “in this and the following verse, the apostle, by using the most general expression possible, <span class="ital">every soul of man, </span>and by twice introducing the distribution of Jew and Greek, which, according to the ideas of the Jews, comprehended all mankind, (see note on chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>,) has left his reader no room to doubt that he is discoursing of the judgment of all nations, of heathen as well as of Jews and Christians. Therefore, not only what he says of <span class="ital">the punishments, </span>but what he observes of <span class="ital">the rewards </span>to be distributed at that day, must be understood of the heathen, as well as of those who have enjoyed the benefit of revelation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We see also, by these two verses, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-9.htm" title="Tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man that does evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;...">Romans 2:9-10</a>,) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16</a>, that the apostle carefully lays it down as a fundamental position that there was now, under the gospel, no other national distinction between the Jews and the Gentiles, save only a priority of right in the Jews to the offer of the gospel, and the allotment of rewards or punishments, according as they obeyed or not. <span class="ital">But glory, </span>(just opposite to <span class="ital">wrath,</span>) — From the divine approbation; <span class="ital">honour, </span>(opposite to <span class="ital">indignation,</span>) — By the divine appointment; <span class="ital">and peace </span>— Implying a secure and quiet possession of all good, now and for ever, opposed to <span class="ital">tribulation and anguish. To every one that worketh good </span>— Sincerely performs his duty to God and man; <span class="ital">to the</span> <span class="ital">Jew first, </span>&c. — To one as well as another. <span class="ital">For there is no respect of persons with God </span>— That is, in passing their final sentence, and in distributing rewards and punishments, he is determined by their real characters, and will reward every one according to his works, not according to their outward condition; such as their country, kindred, sex, dignity, office, wealth, and profession of religion. This declaration concerning God, as Judge, the apostle made to show the Jews their folly in expecting favour at the final judgment, because they had Abraham for their father, and were themselves members of God’s church. And it must appear the more important and seasonable, considering that the Jews thought no Israelite should be deprived of future happiness, whatever his faults had been; unless he were guilty of apostacy, idolatry, and a few other very enormous crimes. But this impartial and equitable proceeding at the final judgment is very consistent with God’s distributing to persons here advantages and opportunities of improvement, according to his own good pleasure.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-16 The Jews thought themselves a holy people, entitled to their privileges by right, while they were unthankful, rebellious, and unrighteous. But all who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must be reminded that the judgment of God will be according to their real character. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's own thoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness of God. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various, all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must be hatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of the mind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. It shows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great change wrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every human being. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitent heart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words, treasuring up wrath. In the description of the just man, notice the full demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, and rejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the description of the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of all evil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. Even Gentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directed them what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted or condemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfort to saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shall be rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who are contentious - This expression usually denotes those who are of a quarrelsome or litigious disposition; and generally has reference to controversies among people. But here it evidently denotes a disposition toward God, and is of the same signification as rebellious, or as opposing God. They who contend with the Almighty; who resist his claims, who rebel against his laws, and refuse to submit to his requirements, however made known. The Septuagint use the verb to translate the Hebrew word &#1502;&#1512;&#1492;  maarah, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-20.htm">Deuteronomy 21:20</a>. One striking characteristic of the sinner is, that he contends with God, that is, that he opposes and resists his claims. This is the case with all sinners; and it was particularly so with the Jews, and hence, the apostle used the expression here to characterize them particularly. His argument he intended to apply to the Jews, and hence he used such an expression as would exactly describe them. This character of being a rebellious people was one which was often charged on the Jewish nation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-24.htm">Deuteronomy 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-27.htm">Deuteronomy 31:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-9.htm">Isaiah 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-23.htm">Jeremiah 5:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>.<p>Do not obey the truth - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>. The truth here denotes the divine will, which is alone the light of truth (Calvin). It means true doctrine in opposition to false opinions; and to refuse to obey it is to regard it as false, and to resist its influence. The truth here means all the correct representations which had been made of God, and his perfections, and law, and claims, whether by the light of nature or by revelation. The description thus included Gentiles and Jews, but particularly the latter, as they had been more signally favored with the light of truth. It had been an eminent characteristic of the Jews that they had refused to obey the commands of the true God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-6.htm">Joshua 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-2.htm">Judges 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-10.htm">Judges 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-12.htm">2 Kings 18:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-25.htm">Jeremiah 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-21.htm">Jeremiah 42:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-4.htm">Jeremiah 43:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-7.htm">Jeremiah 43:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-13.htm">Jeremiah 9:13</a>.<p>But obey unrighteousness - The expression means that they yielded themselves to iniquity, and thus became the servants of sin, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>. Iniquity thus may be said to reign over people, as they follow the dictates of evil, make no resistance to it, and implicitly obey all its hard requirements.<p>Indignation and wrath - That is, these shall be rendered to those who are contentious, etc. The difference between indignation and wrath, says Ammonius, is that the former is of short duration, but the latter is a long continued remembrance of evil. The one is temporary, the other denotes continued expressions of hatred of evil. Eustathius says that the word "indignation" denotes the internal emotion, but wrath the external manifestation of indignation. (Tholuck.) Both words refer to the opposition which God will cherish and express against sin in the world of punishment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The interpretation formerly usual: <span class="ital">qui sunt ex contentione</span> (Vulg.), <span class="ital">those fond of strife</span> (Origen, Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Beza, Calvin, etc.), which was understood for the most part as <span class="ital">those rebelling against God</span>, is based partly on the erroneous derivation from <span class="greekheb">ἔρις</span>, partly on the groundless assumption that in the other passages of the N. T. the sense of <span class="ital">quarrelsomeness</span> is necessary. Since this is not the case, Reiche’s conjecture is irrelevant, that the <span class="ital">vulgar usus loquendi</span> had erroneously derived the word from <span class="greekheb">ἔρις</span> and had <span class="ital">lent</span> to it the corresponding signification. Köllner explains it rightly as <span class="ital">partisanship</span>, but gratuitously assumes that this was a special designation for “<span class="ital">godless character</span>” in general. So in substance also Fritzsche: “homines <span class="ital">nequam</span>.” The very addition, further describing these men, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀπειθοῦσι</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ἀδικίᾳ</span>, quite allows us to suppose that Paul had before his mind the strict and proper meaning of the word <span class="ital">partisanship;</span> and it is therefore unwarrantable to base the common but linguistically erroneous explanation on <span class="ital">the affinity between the notions</span> of partisanship and of contentiousness (Philippi). The question to be determined is not the category of ideas to which the <span class="greekheb">ἐριθεύειν</span> belongs, but the definite individual idea which it expresses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὈΡΓῊ Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΥΜΌς</span></span></span>] sc[623] <span class="greekheb">ἔσται</span>.
