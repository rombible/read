But in that mutual intercourse it is not the thoughts that accuse or defend, but the tongue. The Apostle is speaking strictly of the private tribunal of conscience.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-16 The Jews thought themselves a holy people, entitled to their privileges by right, while they were unthankful, rebellious, and unrighteous. But all who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must be reminded that the judgment of God will be according to their real character. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's own thoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness of God. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various, all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must be hatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of the mind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. It shows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great change wrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every human being. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitent heart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words, treasuring up wrath. In the description of the just man, notice the full demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, and rejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the description of the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of all evil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. Even Gentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directed them what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted or condemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfort to saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shall be rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which show - Who thus evince or show.<p>The work of the law - The design, purpose, or object which is contemplated by the revealed Law; that is, to make known to man his duty, and to enforce the obligation to perform it. This does not mean, by any means, that they had all the knowledge which the Law would impart, for then there would have been no need of a revelation, but that, as far as it went, as far as they had a knowledge of right and wrong, they coincided with the revealed will of God. In other words, the will of God, whether made known by reason or revelation, will be the same so far as reason goes. The difference is that revelation goes further than reason; sheds light on new duties and doctrines; as the information given by the naked eye and the telescope is the same, except, that the telescope carries the sight forward, and reveals new worlds to the sight of man.<p>Written in their hearts - The revealed Law of God was written on tables of stone, and then recorded in the books of the Old Testament. This law the Gentiles did not possess, but, to a certain extent, the same requirements were written on their hearts. Though not revealed to them as to the Jews, yet they had obtained the knowledge of them by the tight of nature. The word "hearts" here denotes the mind itself, as it does also frequently in the Sacred Scriptures; not the heart, as the seat of the affections. It does not mean that they loved or even approved of the Law, but that they had knowledge of it; and that that knowledge was deeply engraved on their minds.<p>Their conscience - This word properly means the judgment of the mind respecting right and wrong; or the judgment which the mind passes on the morality or immorality of its own actions, when it instantly approves or condemns them. It has usually been termed the moral sense, and is a very important principle in a moral government. Its design is to answer the purposes of an ever attendant witness of a man's conduct; to compel him to pronounce on his own doings, and thus to excite him to virtuous deeds, to give comfort and peace when he does right, to deter from evil actions by making him, whether he will or no, his own executioner: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-9.htm">John 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a>. By nature every man thus approves or condemns his own acts; and there is not a profounder principle of the divine administration, than thus compelling every man to pronounce on the moral character of his own conduct. Conscience may be enlightened or unenlightened; and its use may be greatly perverted by false opinions. Its province is not to communicate any new truth, it is simply to express judgment, and to impart pleasure or inflict pain for a man's own good or evil conduct. The apostle's argument, does not require him to say that conscience revealed any truth, or any knowledge of duty, to the Gentiles, but that its actual exercise proved that they had a knowledge of the Law of God. Thus, it was a witness simply of that fact.<p>Bearing witness - To bear witness is to furnish testimony, or proof. And the exercise of the conscience here showed or proved that they had a knowledge of the Law. The expression does not mean that the exercise of their conscience bore witness of anything to them, but that its exercise may be alleged as a proof that they were not without some knowledge of the Law.<p>And their thoughts - The word "thoughts" (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  logismo&#772;n) means properly reasonings, or opinions, sentiments, etc. Its meaning here may be expressed by the word "reflections." Their reflections on their own conduct would be attended with pain or pleasure. It differs from conscience, inasmuch as the decisions of conscience are instantaneous, and without any process of reasoning. This supposes subsequent reflection, and it means that such reflections would only deepen and confirm the decisions of conscience.<p>The mean while - Margin, "Between themselves." The rendering in the margin is more in accordance with the Greek. The expression sometimes means, in the mean time, or at the same time; and sometimes afterward, or subsequently. The Syriac and Latin Vulgate render this mutually. They seem to have understood this as affirming that the pagan among themselves, by their writings, accused or acquitted one another.<p>Accusing - If the actions were evil.<p>Excusing - That is, if their actions were good.<p>One another - The margin renders this expression in connection with the adverb, translated "in the mean while," "between themselves." This view is also taken by many commentators, and this is its probable meaning. If so, it denotes the fact that in their reflections, or their reasonings, or discussions, they accused each other of crime, or acquitted one another; they showed that they had a law; that they acted on the supposition that they had. To show this was the design of the apostle; and there was no further proof of it needed than what he here adduced.<p>(1) They had a conscience, pronouncing on their own acts; and,<p>(2) Their reasonings, based on the supposition of some such common and acknowledged standard of accusing or acquitting, supposed the same thing. If, therefore, they condemned or acquitted themselves; if in these reasonings and reflections, they proceeded on the principle that they had some rule of right and wrong, then the proposition of the apostle was made out that it was right for God to judge them, and to destroy them; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8-12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing&#8212;that is, perhaps by turns doing both.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="bld">the work of the law, </span> either understand the sum of the law, which is, To love God above all, and our neighbour as ourselves; or the office of the law, which consists in directing what to do, and what to leave undone; or the external actions which the law prescribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Written in their hearts; </span> this seems to be a covenant promise and privilege, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm" title="But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, said the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.">Jeremiah 31:33</a></span>; how then is it predicated of the Gentiles? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answer.</span> Jereramiah speaks there of a special and supernatural inscription or writing in the heart by grace; and the apostle here, of that which is common and natural. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another; </span> interchangeably, now one way, anon another.

Though the Gentiles had not the law in form, written on tables, or in a book, yet they had "the work", the matter, the sum and substance of it in their minds; as appears by the practices of many of them, in their external conversation. The moral law, in its purity and perfection, was written on the heart of Adam in his first creation; was sadly obliterated by his sin and fall; upon several accounts, and to answer various purposes, a system of laws was written on tables of stone for the use of the Israelites; and in regeneration the law is reinscribed on the hearts of God's people; and even among the Gentiles, and in their hearts, there are some remains of the old law and light of nature, which as by their outward conduct appears, so by the inward motions of their minds, <p>their conscience also bearing witness; for, as the Jews say (r)    , "the soul of a man witnesses in him"; for, or against him: <p>and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or else excusing one another; and this the Heathens themselves acknowledge, when they (s) speak of <p>"tameion dikasthrion kai krithrion thv suneidhsewv, "the conclave, tribunal and judgment of conscience"; and which they call , "the most righteous judge": whose judgment reason receives, and gives its suffrage to, whether worthy of approbation or reproof; when it reads in the memory as if written on a table the things that are done, and then beholding the law as an exemplar, pronounces itself either worthy of honour or dishonour.'' <p>(r) T.

To the Greeks, however, this was something greater and more sacred than any statute, or civil constitution; to the Apostle it was less than the great revelation of God’s will, which had been made and interpreted to Israel, but nevertheless a true moral authority. There is a triple proof that Gentiles, who are regarded as not having law, are a law to themselves. (1) The appeal to their conduct: as interpreted by the Apostle, their conduct evinces, at least in some, the possession of a law written on the heart; (2) the action of conscience: it joins its testimony, though it be only an inward one, to the outward testimony borne by their conduct; and (3) their thoughts. Their thoughts bear witness to the existence of a law in them, inasmuch as in their mutual intercourse (<span class="greekheb">μεταξὺ ἀλλήλων</span>) these thoughts are busy bringing accusations, or in rarer cases (<span class="greekheb">ἢ καί</span>) putting forward defences, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, in any case, exercising moral functions which imply the recognition of a law. This seems to me the only simple and natural explanation of a rather perplexed phrase. We need not ask for what Paul does not give, the object to <span class="greekheb">κατηγορούντων</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογουμένων</span>: it may be any person, act or situation, which calls into exercise that power of moral judgment which shows that the Gentiles, though without the law of Moses, are not in a condition which makes it impossible to judge them according to their works. The construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm" title="I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,">Romans 9:1</a> suggests that the <span class="greekheb">συν</span> views the witness of conscience, reflecting on conduct, as something added to the first instinctive consciousness of the nature of an action. <span class="greekheb">συνείδησις</span> does not occur in the Gospels except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-9.htm" title="And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.">John 8:9</a>; twice only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>, both times in speeches of St. Paul; twenty times in the Pauline epistles. It occurs in the O.T. only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm" title="Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a> (curse not the King, <span class="greekheb">ἐν συνειδήσει σου</span> = ne in cogitatione quidem tua): the ordinary sense is found, for the first time in Biblical Greek, in Sap. 17:11. It is a quasi-philosophical word, much used by the Stoics, and belonging rather to the Greek than the Hebrew inheritance of Paul.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">which shew</span>] The relative pronoun is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm" title="Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.

It marks a condition: “they are a law to themselves, <span class="bld">inasmuch as, &c</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shew the work of the law written in their hearts</span>] “<span class="ital">The work</span> of the law” has been explained as if collective for “<span class="ital">works;</span>” but this is ill-supported by real parallels. It is better to explain it as “what the law does,” than as “what is done for the law’s sake;” and thus it means the teaching of the Difference of right and wrong (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>). This “work,” done in an intense degree by the law, is done in a lower degree by conscience alone; but the work is the same in kind. The sense of wrong and right, which it is the law’s work to produce fully, is somehow and in some measure, without the law, “<span class="ital">written</span>” in heathen “<span class="ital">hearts</span>.” (On the word <span class="ital">heart</span> see note to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a>.)—“They <span class="ital">shew:</span>”—this word may of course refer to <span class="ital">subjective</span> discovery; each man shewing it to himself, finding it in his experience. But it better suits the word to take it of <span class="ital">mutual</span> manifestations: language and conduct, in heathen communities, shewing the objective reality of the convictions which individuals are aware of.—“<span class="ital">Written:</span>”—for this metaphor, no doubt suggested by the tablets of Sinai, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:...">2 Corinthians 3:2-3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">their conscience also bearing witness</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">bearing witness with, bearing concurrent witness.</span> What is the <span class="ital">concurrence?</span> It may be “of conscience with itself,” in its different verdicts. But, on our view of the passage, it is “<span class="ital">with the common conviction</span>.” Individual consciences affirm the common conviction of moral distinctions which they find around them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm" title="I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,">Romans 9:1</a> the witness of conscience is again appealed to, with the same verb: lit. “bearing witness <span class="ital">with me</span>” See note there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and their thoughts</span>, &c.] Better, <span class="bld">and between one another their reckonings</span> (or <span class="bld">reasonings</span>) <span class="bld">accusing, or, it may be, defending. The</span> Gr. of “thought” specially means <span class="ital">reasoning</span> thought, not intuition. It can hardly be a mere synonym of conscience, which (at least in practice) is intuitive. The meaning is either “their consciences are ratified in their verdicts by their private reasonings on particular cases;” or, as seems better on our view, “the fact of their moral sense is evinced by their reasonings on right and wrong;” e.g. by Treatises and Dialogues in which ethical questions are discussed. “<span class="ital">Between one another</span>” thus refers not to one mind’s balance of thought with thought, but to arguments of man with man. St Paul says nothing of the Tightness of these reasonings in particular cases, but of the <span class="ital">moral significance of the fact of them</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐνδείκνυνται</span>, <span class="ital">they show</span>) [demonstrate] to themselves, to others, and, in some respects, to God Himself.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ἔργον τοῦ νόμου</span>, <span class="ital">the work of the law</span>), the law itself, with its practical [active] operation.

Paul, by way of contrast, alludes to the tables of Moses. This <span class="ital">writing</span> is antecedent to the <span class="ital">doing</span> of those things, <span class="ital">which are contained in the law;</span> but afterwards, when any one has done, or (has not done) the things commanded, [<span class="ital">the demonstration, or</span>] <span class="ital">the showing</span> [of the work of the law] follows, and that permanent writing [viz., that on the heart] becomes more clearly apparent—<span class="greekheb">συμμαρτυρούσης</span>, <span class="ital">simultaneously bearing witness</span>) An allegory; the prosecution, the criminal, the witnesses are in court; conscience is a witness; the thoughts accuse, or also defend.

Others, among themselves, as in internal debate. So Alford, "thought against thought in inner strife." Others again, accusations or vindications carried on between Gentiles and Gentiles. As the other parts of the description refer to the individual soul in itself and not to relations with others, the explanation expressed in Rev. - the mutual relations and interchanges of the individual thoughts - seems preferable. </body></html>
