But all who act thus, of every nation, age, and description, must be reminded that the judgment of God will be according to their real character. The case is so plain, that we may appeal to the sinner's own thoughts. In every wilful sin, there is contempt of the goodness of God. And though the branches of man's disobedience are very various, all spring from the same root. But in true repentance, there must be hatred of former sinfulness, from a change wrought in the state of the mind, which disposes it to choose the good and to refuse the evil. It shows also a sense of inward wretchedness. Such is the great change wrought in repentance, it is conversion, and is needed by every human being. The ruin of sinners is their walking after a hard and impenitent heart. Their sinful doings are expressed by the strong words, treasuring up wrath. In the description of the just man, notice the full demand of the law. It demands that the motives shall be pure, and rejects all actions from earthly ambition or ends. In the description of the unrighteous, contention is held forth as the principle of all evil. The human will is in a state of enmity against God. Even Gentiles, who had not the written law, had that within, which directed them what to do by the light of nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they nature. Conscience is a witness, and first or last will bear witness. As they kept or broke these natural laws and dictates, their consciences either acquitted or condemned them. Nothing speaks more terror to sinners, and more comfort to saints, than that Christ shall be the Judge. Secret services shall be rewarded, secret sins shall be then punished, and brought to light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the day - This verse is doubtless to be connected with <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>, and the intermediate verses are a parenthesis, and it implies that the pagan world, as well as the Jews, will be arraigned at the bar of judgment. At that time God will judge all in righteousness, the Jew by the Law which he had, and the pagan by the Law which he had.<p>When God shall judge - God is often represented as the Judge of mankind; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-4.htm">Psalm 50:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-6.htm">Romans 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>. But this does not militate against the fact that he will do it by Jesus Christ. God has appointed his Son to administer judgment; and it will be not by God directly, but by Jesus Christ that it will be administered.<p>The secrets of men - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, "For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing," etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-26.htm">Matthew 10:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>. The expression denotes the hidden desires, lusts, passions, and motives of people; the thoughts of the heart, as well as the outward actions of the life. It will be a characteristic of the day of judgment, that all these will he brought out, and receive their appropriate reward. The propriety of this is apparent, for,<p>(1) It is by these that the character is really determined. The motives and principles of a man constitute his character, and to judge him impartially, these must be known.<p>(2) They are not judged or rewarded in this life. The external conduct only can be seen by people, and of course that only can be rewarded or punished here.<p>(3) People of pure motives and pure hearts are often here basely aspersed and calumniated. They are persecuted, traduced, and often overwhelmed with ignominy. It is proper that the secret motives of their conduct should be brought out and approved.<p>On the other hand, people of base motives, people of unprincipled character, and who are corrupt at the heart, are often lauded, flattered, and exalted into public estimation. It is proper that their secret principles should be detected, and that they should take their proper place in the government of God. In regard to this expression, we may further remark,<p>(1) That the fact that all secret thoughts and purposes will be brought into judgment, invests the judgment with an awful character. Who should not tremble at the idea that the secret plans and desires of his soul, which he has so long and so studiously concealed, should be brought out into noon-day in the judgment? All his artifices of concealment shall be then at an end. He will be able to practice disguise no longer. He will be seen as he is; and he will receive the doom he deserves. There will be one place, at least, where the sinner shall be treated as he ought.<p>(2) to execute this judgment implies the power of searching the heart; of knowing the thoughts; and of developing and unfolding all the purposes and plans of the soul. Yet this is intrusted to Jesus Christ, and the fact that he will exercise this, shows that he is divine.<p>Of men - Of all people, whether Jew or Gentile, infidel or Christian. The day of judgment, therefore, may be regarded as a day of universal development of all the plans and purposes that have ever been entertained in this world.<p>By Jesus Christ - The fact that Jesus Christ is appointed to judge the world is abundantly taught in the Bible, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-5.htm">1 Peter 4:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm">John 5:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>.<p>According to my gospel - According to the gospel which I preach.

This does not mean that the gospel which he preached would be the rule by which God would judge all mankind, for he had just said that the pagan world would be judged by a different rule, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>. But it means that he was intrusted with the gospel to make it known; and that one of the great and prime articles of that gospel was, that God would judge the world by Jesus Christ.

These words are to be read in connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm">Romans 2:13</a>, and express the time when both Jews and Gentiles will be judged, called a "day", both because of the clearness and evidence of the judgment that will be made, and because a certain time is fixed, though not known, which will surely come; also the matter of the judgment, which will be, <p>the secrets of men: whether good or bad, which are only known to God and themselves, and which may have been done ignorantly by them; "for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil", <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, which is so interpreted by the Jews (t), <p>"when R. Jochanan came to that Scripture, he wept; "for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing";'' <p>upon which the gloss says, yea, for those things which are hidden from him, which he has committed through ignorance, will he bring him into judgment; everything, even the least thing in a literal sense, but not for such silly trifling things they mention in the same place; doubtless the Holy Ghost means the secrets of men's hearts and actions, and the hidden things of darkness which are contrary to the holy law of God. The person by whom this awful judgment will be carried on is, <p>Jesus Christ; to whom all judgment is committed, who is ordained Judge of quick and dead, and is every way fit for that office, being God as well as man, and so both omniscient and omnipotent: and this the apostle says will be, <p>according to my Gospel; his meaning is not that the Gospel will be the, rule of judgment, because he speaking of the judgment of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jews, who never heard of the Gospel; but that what he had said concerning a day of judgment, of Christ's being the Judge, and of God's judging by him the secrets of men, were as true and as certain as the Gospel which he preached was; and was "conformable", or agreeable to it, as the Arabic version reads it, and might be learned and proved from it. This he calls, "my Gospel"; not because the author or subject of it; but because it was committed to his trust and was preached by him; and in opposition to, and to distinguish it from the Gospel of the false apostles.

While Ewald goes so far as to join it with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a>, and regards everything intervening as a parenthesis, many, and recently most expositors, have connected it with the immediately preceding <span class="greekheb">συμμαρτ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογ</span>.; in which case, however, <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμέρᾳ</span> cannot be taken for <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἡμέραν</span> (Calvin), nor the <span class="ital">present</span> participles in a <span class="ital">future</span> sense (Fritzsche), since, in accordance with the context, they are <span class="ital">contemporary with</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐνδείκνυνται</span>. And for that very reason we must reject the view, which has been often assumed, that Paul suddenly transports himself from the present into the time of the judgment, when the exercise of conscience in the Gentiles will be specially active, and that for this reason he at once adds <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμέρᾳ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[666] directly without inserting a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΤΟῦΤΟ ΜΆΛΙΣΤΑ</span></span></span>, or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΤΟῦΤΟ ΓΕΝΉΣΕΤΑΙ</span></span></span>, or the like (Rückert; Tholuck, de Wette, Reithmayr, Philippi, van Hengel, Umbreit; comp Estius). The supposition of such an illogical and violent leap of thought in so clear and steady a thinker as Paul is thoroughly arbitrary and wholly without analogy. Moreover, the simple <span class="ital">temporal</span> self-judgment of the Gentiles fits into the connection so perfectly, that Paul cannot even have conceived of it as an <span class="ital">anticipation</span> of the last judgment (Mehring).

Westcott and Hort only put a comma after <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογουμένων</span>, but a longer pause is necessary, unless we are to suppose that only the day of judgment wakes the conscience and the thoughts of man into the moral activity described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a>.

Hence <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a> is really to be taken with the main verbs of the whole paragraph, <span class="greekheb">ἀπολοῦνται</span>, <span class="greekheb">κριθήσονται</span>, <span class="greekheb">δικαιωθήσονται</span>: the great principle of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm" title="Who will render to every man according to his deeds:">Romans 2:6</a>—<span class="greekheb">ἀποδώσει ἑκάστῳ κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ</span>—will be exhibited in action on the day on which God judges the secret things of men through Christ Jesus. A final judgment belonged to Jewish theology, and perhaps, though this is open to question, one in which the Messiah acted as God’s representative; but what Paul teaches here does not rest merely on the transference of a Jewish Messianic function to Jesus. If there is anything certain in the N.T. it is that this representation of Jesus as judge of the world rests on the words of our Lord Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm" title="Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out devils? and in your name done many wonderful works?">Matthew 7:22</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm" title="When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:">Matthew 25:31</a> ff.).

(Baldensperger, <span class="ital">Das Selbstbewusstsein Jesu</span>, . 85 f., thinks that in the circles of Jewish Pietism, in the century before Christ, the Messiah was already spoken of as the Divine judge, and as sharing the titles and attributes of Jehovah.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-17.htm" title="Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,...">Romans 2:17-24</a> the Apostle brings to a point the argument for which he has been clearing the way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-1.htm" title="Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are that judge: for wherein you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you that judge do the same things....">Romans 2:1-16</a>. The Jew makes much of the possession of the law, but when we pass from possession to practice, he is not a whit better than the “lawless” Gentile. The construction is not quite regular, but the meaning is clear. The natural order would be: If thou bearest the name of Jew, and restest upon the law, <span class="ital">and yet in thy conduct settest the law at nought</span>, art not thou equally under condemnation with sinners of the Gentiles?

But the parenthesis is thus, even in the style of St Paul, highly difficult and peculiar; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a> stands in close natural connexion with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm" title="For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;">Romans 2:12</a>.

The “<span class="ital">secret</span> things” are here named, as implying also of course the judgment of all that is “<span class="ital">open</span> beforehand.” Perhaps the word alludes too to the “cloke” of Jewish formality, and faith in privileges.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by Jesus Christ according to my gospel</span>] The word “Gospel” is here used (a deeply significant use) of the entire contents of the Apostle’s teaching; of holy principles and threats of condemnation as well as holy promises of life.—“<span class="ital">My</span> Gospel:”—same word as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>. The original of the phrase is not strongly emphatic, but certainly not without point. It indicates on one hand St Paul’s deep certainty of his direct Divine commission and its precise import, and on the other his consciousness (much more strongly expressed in the Galatian Epistle) of <span class="ital">opposition</span> to his position and doctrine. Cf. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:...">Galatians 1:6-12</a>.—“By <span class="ital">Jesus Christ:</span>”—the words emphatically close the sentence; perhaps with implicit reference to the rejection, by the unbelieving Jews whom the Apostle now more distinctly addresses, of Him who is to judge the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ἡμέρᾳ</span>, <span class="ital">in the day</span>) It is construed with <span class="ital">show</span>, for the present tense is no objection; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a> employs the present in the same general way. And Paul often says, <span class="ital">in the day of the Lord</span>, which implies more than <span class="ital">against</span> [or <span class="ital">unto the day</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>—comp. <span class="ital">before</span>, or <span class="ital">in the presence of</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm" title="I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.">1 Timothy 5:21</a>, note. Such as each thing was, such it shall then be seen, be determined, and remain. In that day, that writing of the law on the hearts of men will be manifest, having also joined with it some defence of upright acts, although the man be condemned [fall] in the <span class="ital">judgment</span>, himself being his own accuser, on account of other offences. And that circumstance implies, as a consequence, [infers] (reasoning, from the greater to the less, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, from the final judgment, to the judgments of conscience in the present life), accusation, or even defence, exercised in this life also, as often as either the future judgment itself is vividly presented before a man, or its anticipations, without the man’s own privity (consciousness), are at work in the conscience.—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>. And Scripture often speaks so of the future, especially of the last things, as that it presupposes those which precede them. The Jews at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a>, as the Gentiles in this passage, are threatened with the future judgment.—<span class="greekheb">τὰ κρυπτὰ</span>, <span class="ital">the secrets</span>) <span class="ital">the conscience</span>, and <span class="ital">the thoughts</span>.—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>. This confirms the connection of this verse with the preceding. The true quality of actions, generally unknown even to the agents themselves, depends on the secrets.—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>. Men judge by outward manifestations, even concerning themselves. Outward manifestations of good or evil will also be judged, but not then for the first time; for they are judged, even from the time in which they are wrought; deeds, that are secret, are then at length brought to judgment.—<span class="greekheb">τῶν ἀνθρώπων</span>, of <span class="ital">men</span>) even of the Gentiles.—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span>, <span class="ital">according to</span>) <span class="ital">i.e.</span> as my Gospel teaches. Paul adds this short clause, because he is here dealing with a man, who does not yet know Jesus Christ. The Gospel is the whole preaching as to Christ; and Christ will be the Judge; and the judgment in regard to the Gentiles, is not so expressly declared in the Old, as in the New Testament. And it is called the Gospel of Paul, as it was preached by Paul, even to the Gentiles.—<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>. All the articles of evangelical doctrine, and the article concerning the final judgment, greatly illustrate one another; and moreover, this very article, even in respect of believers, is altogether evangelical.—<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-42.htm" title="And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.">Acts 10:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-5.htm" title="Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.">1 Peter 4:5</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ</span>. About this verse the main question is, what previous assertion the "when" refers to. The time denoted by "when" (whether we suppose <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> the present or future tense - to have been intended by the writer) is certainly the <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, and ether passages - the day of doom, when "every man's <span class="accented">work</span> shall be made manifest." Hence immediate connection of this verse with the preceding one, which would otherwise have been the natural one, seems to be precluded; for in ver. 15 the present operation of conscience, during this present life, was described. One way of making the connection obvious is by understanding ver. 15 as itself denoting the manifestation reserved for the day of judgment, when all will stand self-convicted. But not only the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the present tense, but also the fact of the whole verse being so obvious a description of present human consciousness, seems to preclude this view. Some would connect ver. 16 with ver. 12, of which it is in itself a natural sequence; and this connection is intimated in the Authorized Version, which includes the three verses that come between in a parenthesis. The objection to it is the length of the parenthesis. Probably the apostle, in his characteristic way, paid little regard to precise logical sequence; he only desired to express, in this concluding verse, that in the great day full justice would be done, and all that he had been speaking of would be made plain. <span class="accented">My gospel</span> means "the gospel committed unto me to preach" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>). The idea that it means "the Gospel according to St. Luke," said to have been written under St. Paul's superintendence, is too improbable to call for serious notice. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>My gospel<p>As distinguished from false teaching Paul's assurance of the truth of the Gospel is shown in his confident assertion that it will form the standard of judgment in the great day. </body></html>
