It points at Christ, and it refers to the promise, Ge 12:3. In Thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. The law worketh wrath, by showing that every transgressor is exposed to the Divine displeasure. As God intended to give men a title to the promised blessings, so he appointed it to be by faith, that it might be wholly of grace, to make it sure to all who were of the like precious faith with Abraham, whether Jews or Gentiles, in all ages. The justification and salvation of sinners, the taking to himself the Gentiles who had not been a people, were a gracious calling of things which are not, as though they were; and this giving a being to things that were not, proves the almighty power of God. The nature and power of Abraham's faith are shown. He believed God's testimony, and looked for the performance of his promise, firmly hoping when the case seemed hopeless. It is weakness of faith, that makes a man lie poring on the difficulties in the way of a promise. Abraham took it not for a point that would admit of argument or debate. Unbelief is at the bottom of all our staggerings at God's promises. The strength of faith appeared in its victory over fears. God honours faith; and great faith honours God. It was imputed to him for righteousness. Faith is a grace that of all others gives glory to God. Faith clearly is the instrument by which we receive the righteousness of God, the redemption which is by Christ; and that which is the instrument whereby we take or receive it, cannot be the thing itself, nor can it be the gift thereby taken and received. Abraham's faith did not justify him by its own merit or value, but as giving him a part in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the promise ... - To show that the faith of Abraham, on which his justification depended, was not by the Law, the apostle proceeds to show that the promise concerning which his faith was so remarkably evinced was before the Law was given. If this was so, then it was an additional important consideration in opposition to the Jew, showing that acceptance with God depended on faith, and not on works.<p>That he should be heir of the world - An heir is one who succeeds, or is to succeed to an estate. In this passage, the world, or the entire earth, is regarded as the estate to which reference is made, and the promise is that the posterity of Abraham should succeed to that, or should possess it as their inheritance. The precise expression used here, "heir of the world," is not found in the promises made to Abraham Those promises were that God would make of him a great nation <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>; that in him all the families of the earth should be blessed <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; that his posterity should be as the stars for multitude <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; and that he should be a father of many nations <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>. As this latter promise is one to which the apostle particularly refers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17</a>), it is probable that he had this in his eye. This promise had, at first, respect to his numerous natural descendants, and to their possessing the land of Canaan. But it is also regarded in the New Testament as extending to the Messiah <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a> as his descendant, and to all his followers as the spiritual seed of the father of the faithful. When the apostle calls him "the heir of the world," he sums up in this comprehensive expression all the promises made to Abraham, intimating that his spiritual descendants, that is, those who possess his faith, shall yet be so numerous as to possess all lands.<p>Or to his seed - To his posterity, or descendants.<p>Through the law - By the observance of the Law; or made in consequence of observing the Law; or depending on the condition that he should observe the Law. The covenant was made before the law of circumcision was given; and long before the Law of Moses (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16-18</a>), and was independent of both.<p>But through ... - In consequence of or in connection with the strong confidence which he showed in the promises of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-15.

Others by <span class="bld">the world</span> do understand the land of Canaan, under which also heaven was typically promised and comprehended: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-3.htm" title="For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.">Hebrews 4:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm" title="By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:">Hebrews 11:9</a>,10,16</span>.

In the whole verse is couched an argument for justification by faith without works, which is the apostle’s drift; and it may be thus formed: If the promise of inheritance to Abraham and his seed was to be accomplished not by legal obedience, but by the righteousness of faith; then it follows, that we are justified by faith, and not by works; but the promise of inheritance to Abraham and his seed was to be accomplished, not by the law, but by the righteousness of faith. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the promise that he should be heir of the world,.... This promise is thought by some to refer to that of his being "the father of many nations", <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-4.htm">Genesis 17:4</a>; by whom the Gentiles are particularly meant, who are sometimes called "the world", and "the whole world", or the elect of God, the believing part of the world; whether among Jews or Gentiles, who sometimes go by the name of "the world" in Scripture: but to this it may be objected, that the promise here spoken of is made to Abraham's seed, as well as to himself; by which is meant not the Messiah, who is indeed heir of the world, and all things in it, but all believers, whether Jews or Gentiles; as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-16.htm">Romans 4:16</a>; and therefore cannot be both heirs and inheritance too. Others think the land of Canaan is designed, and by a synecdoche, a part of the world is put for the whole world; but that land is never so called, and, besides, the promise of it belonged to those of the law, and to them only, contrary to what the apostle argues, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-14.htm">Romans 4:14</a>. Others therefore consider Canaan as a type of heaven, which Abraham and his spiritual seed are heirs of by promise. But rather, by "the world" here, is meant, both this world and that which is to come; Abraham and all believers are the "heirs" of this world, and of all things in it; "all things" are theirs, and, among the rest, the world, Christ being theirs, and they being Christ's; he is heir of all things, and they are joint heirs with him; and how little soever they may enjoy of it now, the time is coming, when they, by virtue of their right, "shall inherit the earth"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9</a>; and now they have as much of it as is necessary, and with a blessing, and which the Jews call their "world". It is a saying in their Talmud (o),  , "thou shall see thy world" in thy lifetime; which the gloss explains, "thou shalt find", or enjoy all thy necessities, or what is needful for thee; and of Abraham they say (p), that <p>"he was the foundation of the world, and that for his sake the world was created;'' <p>and introduce God saying of him thus (q). <p>"as I am the only one in my world, so he is the only one,  "in his world".'' <p>And as he and all the saints are heirs of this world, so of the world to come, the future salvation, the inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, never fading, and reserved in the heavens; for they are heirs of God himself, and shall inherit all things: now this large and comprehensive promise, which takes in the things of time and eternity, <p>was not to Abraham, or to his seed through the law: not through the law of circumcision, or on the score of their obedience to that, for this promise was made before that was enjoined; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>; nor through the law of Moses, which was not as yet given; nor through the law of nature, nor by any righteousness of the law; <p>but through the righteousness of faith: by virtue of which they have "all things that pertain to life and godliness", <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a>; and have "the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come", <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>; enjoy with a blessing what they now have, and have a right and title to the heavenly glory. <p>(o) T.

The argument of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-9.htm" title="Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness....">Romans 4:9-12</a> is reiterated and confirmed here in other terms. Abraham is the father of all believers: for it is not through law that the promise is given to him or his seed, that he should be heir of the world—a condition which would limit the inheritance to the Jews, but through the righteousness of faith—a condition which extends it to all who believe. We might have expected a quasi-historical proof of this proposition, similar to the proof given in 10 f. that Abraham’s justification did not depend on circumcision. But the Apostle takes another and more speculative line. Instead of arguing from the O.T. narrative, as he does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-14.htm" title="That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith....">Galatians 3:14-17</a>, that the promise was given to a justified man before the (Mosaic) law was heard of, and therefore must be fulfilled to all independently of law, he argues that law and promise are mutually exclusive ideas. For (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-14.htm" title="For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:">Romans 4:14</a>) if those who are of law, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, Jews only, as partisans of law, are heirs, then faith (the correlative of promise) has been made vain, and the promise of no effect. And this incompatibility of law and promise in idea is supported by the actual effect of the law in human experience. For the law works wrath—the very opposite of promise. But where there is not law, there is not even transgression, still less the wrath which transgression provokes. Here, then, the other series of conceptions finds its sphere: the world is ruled by grace, promise and faith. This is the world in which Abraham lived, and in which all believers live; and as its typical citizen, he is father of them all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">For the promise</span>, &c.] Here again the Gr. order is emphatic: <span class="bld">For not through the law came the promise, &c</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that he should be the heir</span>] Perhaps better, <span class="bld">namely, his being: heir</span>, in apposition with “the promise.” The promise made him <span class="ital">heir at once</span>, and foretold actual possession. The Gr. word rendered “heir” sometimes means one with a prospect of possession, more rarely an actual possessor.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the world</span>] Perhaps here in its widest meaning; “heaven and earth,” “the universe.” In Christ, the Son of Abraham, to whom “all power is given in heaven and earth,” the inheritance is seen to be universal. And even a Rabbinic phrase is quoted in which “heaven and earth” are named as promised to Abraham. (See too p. 260.)

He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a> and its connexion, it seems clear that the reference here is to the dominion of Christ, “the Prince of the kings of the earth,” to whom “the utmost parts of the earth” are given “for His possession,”—a possession real now, and indeed manifested as real in the important respect that the redeeming power of Messiah is felt in every region, and in an ever-growing degree.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-13.htm" title="For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.">Romans 4:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ γὰρ διὰ νόμου ἡ ἐπαγγελία</span>, <span class="ital">for the promise was not through the law</span>) This is evident in the very terms; and the promise was given before the law. <span class="ital">Through the law</span>, that is, <span class="ital">through the righteousness of the law</span>, but Paul did not wish in his statement to connect righteousness and the law.—<span class="greekheb">ἢ τῷ σπέρματι</span>, <span class="ital">or to his seed</span>) This constitutes the foundation of the consequence derived from Abraham to all believers.—το͂<span class="greekheb">ν κόσμον</span>, <span class="ital">of the world</span>) and therefore <span class="ital">of all persons and things</span>.

The whole <span class="ital">world</span> was promised to Abraham and to his seed conjointly throughout the whole world. The land of Canaan fell to the lot of Abraham, and so one part was allotted to one, and another to another. So also corporeal things are a specimen of things spiritual.

For the Law worketh wrath: for where no law is, neither is there transgression</span>. The point of the argument is that the principle of law is essentially different from that on which Abraham was justified, and which is hence to be understood in the fulfilment of the promise to him and his seed. How this is so is shortly intimated in ver. 15, the idea being more fully expounded in ch. 7. The idea is (as has been already explained) that law simply <span class="accented">declares</span> what is right, and <span class="accented">requires</span> conformity to it; it does not give either <span class="accented">power</span> to obey, or <span class="accented">atonement</span> for not obeying. Hence, in itself, it worketh, not righteousness, but <span class="accented">wrath</span>; for man becomes fully liable to wrath when he comes to know, through law, the difference between right and wrong (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>, "If ye were blind, ye should have no sin"). Exactly the same view of the impossibility of the Mosaic Law being the fulfilment of the promise to Abraham is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3.htm">Galatians 3</a>, where also the real purpose of the Law, intervening thus between the promise and its fulfilment, is further explained. The expression in ver. 13, "that he should be the heir of the world," has reference to the ultimate scope of the Abrahamic promises (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5, 6, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-2.htm">Genesis 17:2-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17, 18</a>). Now, it is true that in some of these promises the language used seems to denote no more than the temporal possession by Israel of the promised land, with dominion (actually realized under David and Solomon) over the whole country from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-14.htm">Genesis 13:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, etc. But their full scope transcends any such limited fulfilment, as where it is said that the promised seed should be as the stars of heaven, and as the dust of the earth that cannot be numbered, and that in it all the nations of the earth should be blessed. The prophets accordingly recognized a far larger ultimate fulfilment in their frequent pictures of the Messiah's universal dominion; and there was no need for the apostle to prove here what the Jews already understood. The only difference between the view current among them and his would be that they would mostly have in view a universal worldly sovereignty with its local centre on the throne of David at Jerusalem, while he interpreted spirttually, seeing beyond the outward framework of prophetic visions to the ideal they imply.

It is to be observed that, though Abraham himself in ver. 13 is spoken of as "the heir of the world," yet the preceding expression, "to Abrabam or to his seed," sufficiently intimates that it is in his seed, identified with him, that he is conceived as so inheriting. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Heir of the world (&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>See on divided by lot, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-19.htm">Acts 13:19</a>; and see on inheritance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>. "Paul here takes the Jewish conception of the universal dominion of the Messianic theocracy prefigured by the inheritance of Canaan, divests it of its Judaistic element, and raises it to a christological truth."
