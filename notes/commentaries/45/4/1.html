Following out this the Apostle shows how even Abraham’s case tells, not against, but for the doctrine of justification by faith. Indeed, Abraham himself came under it. And not only so, but those who act upon this doctrine are spiritually descendants of Abraham. It is entirely a mistake to suppose that they of the circumcision only are Abraham’s seed. The true seed of Abraham are those who follow his example of faith. He put faith in the promise, they must put their faith in the fulfilment of the promise.<p>(1) To come back to the question of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-1.htm" title="What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?">Romans 3:1</a>, repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they?

According to the best MSS. they are distinctly separated from “hath found” and joined with “our father.” They would therefore mean simply “our father according to the flesh,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by natural descent, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Hath found.</span>—<span class= "ital">Hath got,</span> or <span class= "ital">gained,</span> by way of advantage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-1.htm" title="What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?...">Romans 4:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">What shall we say then </span>— The apostle, in the preceding chapter, having shown the impossibility of man’s being justified by the merit of his obedience to any law, moral or ceremonial, or any otherwise than <span class="ital">by grace through faith, </span>judged it necessary, for the sake of the Jews, to consider the case of Abraham, on being whose progeny, and on whose merits, the Jews placed great dependance; as they did also on the ceremony of circumcision, received from him. It was therefore of great importance to know how he was justified; for, in whatever way he, the most renowned progenitor of their nation, obtained that privilege, it was natural to conclude that his descendants must obtain it, if at all, in the same way. Was he justified by works, moral or ceremonial? That is, by the merit of his own obedience to any law or command given him by God? And in particular, was he justified by the ceremony of circumcision, so solemnly enjoined to be observed by him and his posterity? That Abraham was justified by one or other of these means, or by both of them united, the Jews had no doubt. To correct their errors, therefore, the apostle appeals to Moses’s account of Abraham’s justification, and shows therefrom, 1st, That he was not justified by works, but simply by faith in the gracious promise of God, independent of all works; and, 2d, That his circumcision, not performed till he was ninety-nine years of age, had not the least influence on his justification, he having obtained that blessing by means of his faith, long before that time. To this example the apostle appeals with great propriety, both because circumcision was the most difficult of all the rites enjoined in the law, and because Abraham being the father of believers, his justification is the pattern of theirs. Therefore, if circumcision contributed nothing toward Abraham’s justification, the Jews could not hope to be justified thereby, nor by the other rites of the law; and were much to blame in pressing these rites on the Gentiles, as necessary to their salvation, and in consigning all to damnation who were out of the pale of their church. He begins his reasonings on this subject thus: <span class="ital">What shall we say that Abraham, our father </span>— Our great and revered progenitor, <span class="ital">as pertaining to the flesh, hath found </span>— That is, obtained? Hath he obtained justification? The verse is differently understood by expositors. Chrysostom and Theophylact join the words <span class="greekheb">κατα σαρκα</span>, <span class="ital">according to the flesh, </span>with <span class="ital">Abraham our father, </span>thus: <span class="ital">What do we say Abraham, our father according to the flesh, obtained, </span>namely, by works? See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-3.htm" title="For what said the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.">Romans 4:3</a>. But as in no other passage Abraham is called the father of the Jews <span class="ital">according to the flesh, </span>it seems the ordinary translation is to be preferred; and that <span class="ital">flesh </span>in this passage being opposed to <span class="ital">spirit, </span>signifies services pertaining to the flesh or body, on account of which the law of Moses itself is called <span class="ital">flesh, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-3.htm" title="Are you so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are you now made perfect by the flesh?">Galatians 3:3</a>. According to this sense of the expression, the verse may be paraphrased thus: “Ye Jews think ritual services meritorious, because they are performed purely from piety. <span class="ital">But what do we say Abraham our father obtained by works pertaining to the flesh? </span>That he obtained justification meritoriously? No. <span class="ital">For if Abraham </span>had been <span class="ital">justified </span>meritoriously <span class="ital">by works </span>of any kind, <span class="ital">he </span>would have had <span class="ital">whereof to glory </span>— He might have boasted that his justification was no favour, but a debt due to him; but such a ground of boasting he had not before God.” Or more concisely thus: If Abraham had been justified by works, he would have had room to glory: but he had not room to glory: therefore he was not justified by works. By <span class="ital">flesh </span>here Bishop Bull understood those works which Abraham performed in his natural state, and by his own strength, before he obtained justification; but the above-mentioned interpretation seems more agreeable to the apostle’s design here. Nevertheless, in some other passages, where he speaks of <span class="ital">justification by works, </span>he hath in view, not <span class="ital">ceremonial works </span>only, but <span class="ital">moral works </span>also, as is plain from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>; where he tells us, that by the <span class="ital">deeds of the law, </span>or by <span class="ital">works of law, shall no flesh be justified in his sight.</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-12 To meet the views of the Jews, the apostle first refers to the example of Abraham, in whom the Jews gloried as their most renowned forefather. However exalted in various respects, he had nothing to boast in the presence of God, being saved by grace, through faith, even as others. Without noticing the years which passed before his call, and the failures at times in his obedience, and even in his faith, it was expressly stated in Scripture that he believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness, Ge 15:6. From this example it is observed, that if any man could work the full measure required by the law, the reward must be reckoned as a debt, which evidently was not the case even of Abraham, seeing faith was reckoned to him for righteousness. When believers are justified by faith, their faith being counted for righteousness, their faith does not justify them as a part, small or great, of their righteousness; but as the appointed means of uniting them to Him who has chosen as the name whereby he shall be called, the Lord our Righteousness. Pardoned people are the only blessed people. It clearly appears from the Scripture, that Abraham was justified several years before his circumcision. It is, therefore, plain that this rite was not necessary in order to justification. It was a sign of the original corruption of human nature. And it was such a sign as was also an outward seal, appointed not only to confirm God's promises to him and to his seed, and their obligation to be the Lord's, but likewise to assure him of his being already a real partaker of the righteousness of faith. Thus Abraham was the spiritual forefather of all believers, who walked after the example of his obedient faith. The seal of the Holy Spirit in our sanctification, making us new creatures, is the inward evidence of the righteousness of faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What shall we say then? - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1</a>. This is rather the objection of a Jew. "How does your doctrine of justification by faith agree with what the Scriptures say of Abraham? Was the Law set aside in his case? Did he derive no advantage in justification from the rite of circumcision, and from the covenant which God made with him?" The object of the apostle now is to answer this inquiry.<p>That Abraham our father - Our ancestor; the father and founder of the nation; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a> The Jews valued themselves much on the fact that he was their father; and an argument, drawn from his example or conduct, therefore, would be especially forcible.<p>As pertaining to the flesh - This expression is one that has been much controverted. In the original, it may refer either to Abraham as their father "according to the flesh," that is, their natural father, or from whom they were descended; or it may be connected with "hath found." "What shall we say that Abraham our father hath found in respect to the flesh?" &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;  kata sarka. The latter is doubtless the proper connection. Some refer the word "flesh" to external privileges and advantages; others to his own strength or power (Calvin and Grotius); and others make it refer to circumcision. This latter I take to be the correct interpretation. It agrees best with the connection, and equally well with the usual meaning of the word. The idea is, "If people are justified by faith; if works are to have no place; if, therefore, all rites and ceremonies, all legal observances, are useless in justification; what is the advantage of circumcision? What benefit did Abraham derive from it? Why was it appointed? And why is such an importance attached to it in the history of his life." A similar question was asked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-1.htm">Romans 3:1</a>.<p>Hath found - Hath obtained.

The apostle having proved that there is no justification by the works of the law; to make this appear more clear and evident to the Jews, he instances in the greatest person of their nation, and for whom they had the greatest value and esteem, <p>Abraham, our father; who was not a righteous and good man, but the head of the Jewish nation; and, as the Syriac version here styles him, , "the head", or "chief of the fathers"; and so the Alexandrian copy, "our forefather": and was the first of the circumcision, and is described here by his relation to the Jews, "our father"; that is, <p>as pertaining to the flesh; or according to carnal descent, or natural generation and relation; for in a spiritual sense, or with respect to faith and grace, he was the father of others, even of all that believe, whether Jews or Gentiles: now the question put concerning him is, "what he, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?" for the phrase, "as pertaining to the flesh", may be connected with the word <p>found; and to find anything is by seeking to obtain, and enjoy it: and the sense of the whole is, did he find out the way of life, righteousness, and salvation by the mere hint of carnal reason? and did he obtain these things by his own strength? or were these acquired by his circumcision in the flesh, or by any other fleshly privilege he enjoyed? or was he justified before God by any services and performances of his, of whatsoever kind? There is indeed no express answer returned; but it is evident from what follows, that the meaning of the apostle is, that it should be understood in the negative. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">What <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> shall we then say that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> flesh, hath found?</span><p>(1) A new argument of great weight, taken from the example of Abraham the father of all believers: and this is the proposition: if Abraham is considered in himself by his works, he has deserved nothing with which to rejoice with God.<p>(a) By works, as is evident from the next verse.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm" title="What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?">Romans 4:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὖν</span>] <span class="ital">Accordingly</span>, in consequence of the fact that we do not abrogate the law through faith, but on the contrary establish it.[954] This <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> brings in the <span class="ital">proof</span> to be adduced from the history of Abraham (“confirmatio ab exemplo,” Calvin), for the <span class="greekheb">νόμον ἱστῶμεν</span> just asserted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law.">Romans 3:31</a>), in the form of an <span class="ital">inference</span>. For if we should have to say that Abraham our father has attained anything (namely, righteousness) <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span>, that would <span class="ital">presuppose</span> that the law, which attests Abraham’s justification, in nowise receives establishment <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς πίστεως</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law.">Romans 3:31</a>). Hence we have not here an objection, but a question proposed in the way of inference by Paul himself, the answer to which is meant to bring to light, by the example of Abraham, the correctness of his <span class="greekheb">νόμον ἱστ</span>. His object is not to let the matter rest with the short and concise dismissal of the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law.">Romans 3:31</a>, but to enter into the subject more closely; and this he does now by attaching what he has further to say to the authoritatively asserted, and in his own view established, <span class="greekheb">νόμον ἱστάνομεν</span> in the form of an <span class="ital">inference</span>. Moreover, the whole is to be taken as <span class="ital">one</span> question, not to be divided into two by a note of interrogation after <span class="greekheb">ἐροῦμεν</span>; in which case there is harshly and arbitrarily supplied to <span class="greekheb">εὑρηκέναι</span> (by Grotius, Hammond, Clericus, Wetstein, and Michaelis) <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνην</span>, or at least (van Hengel) the pronoun <span class="ital">it</span> representing that word, which however ought to have been immediately suggested by the context, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-12.htm" title="Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.">Php 3:12</a> (comp Nägelsbach on <span class="ital">Il.</span> 1, 76, 302, ed. 3). In the affirmation itself <span class="greekheb">Ἀβρ</span>. is the <span class="ital">subject</span> (<span class="ital">quid dicemus Abrahamum nactum esse</span>?). Th. Schott, by an unhappy distortion of the passage, makes him the <span class="ital">object</span> (“<span class="ital">why should we then say that we have gained Abraham in a fleshly, natural sense for our ancestor</span>?”) This misconception should have been precluded by attending to the simple fact, that in no passage in our Epistle (and in other Epistles the form of expression does not occur) does the <span class="greekheb">τί</span> in <span class="greekheb">τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν</span> mean <span class="ital">why</span>. Hofmann, who had formerly (<span class="ital">Schriftb.</span> II. 2, p. 76 ff.) apprehended it in substance much more correctly, now agrees with Schott in so far that he takes <span class="greekheb">τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν</span> as a question by itself, but then explains <span class="greekheb">Ἀβραάμ</span> likewise as the object, so that the question would be, <span class="ital">whether the Christians think that they have found Abraham as their forefather after the flesh</span>? “The origin of the church of God, to which Christians belong, goes back to Abraham. <span class="ital">In fleshly fashion</span> he is their ancestor, if the event through which he became such (namely, <span class="ital">the begetting of Isaac</span>) lie within the sphere of the natural human life; <span class="ital">in spiritual fashion</span>, on the other hand, if that event belong to the sphere of the history of salvation and its miraculous character, which according to the Scripture (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-23.htm" title="But he who was of the female slave was born after the flesh; but he of the free woman was by promise.">Galatians 4:23</a>) is the case.” This exposition cannot be disputed on linguistic grounds, especially if, with Hofmann, we follow Lachmann’s reading. But it is, viewed in reference to the context, erroneous. For the context, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-2.htm" title="For if Abraham were justified by works, he has whereof to glory; but not before God....">Romans 4:2-3</a> clearly show, treats not of the contrast between the fleshly and the spiritual <span class="ital">fatherhood</span> of Abraham in the case of Christians, but of the <span class="ital">justification</span> of the ancestor, as to whether it took place <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span> or by faith. Moreover, if <span class="greekheb">Ἀβρ</span>. was intended to be the object, Paul would have expressed himself as unintelligibly as possible, since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-2.htm" title="For if Abraham were justified by works, he has whereof to glory; but not before God....">Romans 4:2-3</a> he in the most definite manner represents him as the <span class="ital">subject</span>, whose action is spoken of. If we take Hofmann’s view, in which case we do not at all see why the Apostle should have expressed himself by <span class="greekheb">εὑρηκέναι</span>, he would have written more intelligibly by substituting for this the simple <span class="greekheb">εἶναι</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">Ἀβρ</span>. would have been the subject in the question, as well as in what follows. Finally the proposition that Abraham, as the forefather of <span class="ital">believers as such</span>, was so <span class="ital">not</span> <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span>, was so perfectly self-evident, both with reference to the Jewish and the Gentile portion of the <span class="greekheb">Ἰσραὴλ Θεοῦ</span>, that Paul would hardly have subjected it to discussion as the theme of so earnest a question, while yet no reader would have known that in <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span> he was to think of the <span class="ital">miraculous begetting of Isaac</span>. For even without the latter Abraham would be the <span class="greekheb">προπάτωρ</span> of believers <span class="greekheb">κατὰ πνεῦμα</span>, namely, through his <span class="ital">justification by faith</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-9.htm" title="Comes this blessedness then on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.">Romans 4:9</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πατέρα ἡμ</span>.] “fundamentum consequentiae ab Abrahamo ad nos,” Bengel.

V., belong to “our father,” but to “hath found.” To interpret them here we must remember (what will come out in the course of the Epistle) St Paul’s doctrine of “the flesh.” It is, briefly, that “the flesh” is <span class="ital">human nature, in the Fall, as unrenewed and unassisted by Divine special grace</span>. “According to the flesh” will thus mean here “in respect of his own independent works and merits.” Did Abraham win acceptance as meritoriously keeping the covenant of works, which demands obedience and provides no grace?

The construction then is, <span class="ital">hath found according to</span> [<span class="ital">as pertaining to</span>] <span class="ital">the flesh</span>. In the question itself, Paul inserts something which has the effect of an answer, in order that he may not leave even the smallest countenance for [or, <span class="ital">a moment of time to</span>] the maintaining of Jewish righteousness, and for their boasting before God.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-25.</span> - (5) <span class="accented">Abraham himself shown to have been justified by faith, and not by works, believers being his true heirs.</span> The main points of the argument may be summarized thus: When Abraham obtained a blessing to himself and to his seed for ever, it was by faith, and not by works, that he is declared to have been justified so as to obtain it. Thus the promise to his seed, as well as to himself, rested on the principle of justification by faith only. The Law, of which the principle was essentially different, could not, and did not, in itself fulfil that promise; and that its fulfilment was not dependent on circumcision, or confined to the circumcised, is further shown by the fact that it was before his own circumcision that he received the blessing and the promise, Hence the seed intended in the promise was his spiritual seed, who are of faith such as his was; and in Christ, offering justification through faith to all, the promise is now fulfilled. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What then shall we say that Abraham our father according to the flesh hath found?</span> The connection, denoted by <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, with the preceding argument is rather with vers. 27, 28 of ch. 3, than with its concluding words, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. This appears, not only from the drift of ch. 4, but also from the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 2, connecting the thought with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27</a>. The line of thought is, in the first place, this: We have said that all human glorying is shut out, and that no man can be justified except by faith: how, then (it is important to inquire), was it with Abraham our great progenitor? Did not he at least earn the blessing to his seed by the merit of his works? Had not he, on that ground, whereof to glory? No, not even he. Scripture, in what it says of him, distinctly asserts the contrary. There is uncertainty in this verse as to whether "according to the flesh" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) is to be connected with "our father" or with "hath found." Readings vary in their arrangement of the words. The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. But the great preponderance of authority is in favour of  <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. The first of these readings requires the connection of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; the second allows it, but suggests the other connection. Theodoret, among the ancients, connecting with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, explains <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> thus: "What righteousness, of Abraham's, wrought <span class="accented">before he believed God</span>, did we ever hear of?" Calvin suggests, as the meaning of the phrase (though himself inclining to the connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," naturaliter vel ex seipso." Bull, similarly ('Harmonic Apostolica,' 'Disputatio Posterior,' c. 12:14-17), "by his natural powers, without the grace of God." Alford, following Meyer, says that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> is in contrast to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and that it "refers to that department of our being from which spring works, in contrast with that in which is the exercise of faith." Difficulty is avoided if (as is the most natural inference from the best authenticated reading) we take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> in connection with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, in the sense of our forefather in the way of natural descent, the question being put from the Jewish standpoint; and this in distinction from the other conception of descent from Abraham, according to which all the faithful are called his children (cl. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3, 5, 8</a>:<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>).
