If that justification had been earned by his own works it would then have been something to be proud of; it would be a pride that he might fairly hold both towards men and towards God; for to men he could point to the privileged position that he had gained, and in the sight of God he would be able to plead a certain merit of his own. But he has <span class= "ital">not</span> this merit. His justification was <span class= "ital">not</span> earned, but it was bestowed upon him, not for the sake of his works, but of his faith. This is the express statement of Scripture. And hence it follows that though his privileged position in the sight of men remains, he has nothing to boast of before God.<p><span class= "bld">But not before God.</span>—This is an instance of the rapid and eager dialectic of the Apostle. If the whole train of thought had been given it would probably have run much as above, but the greater part of it is suppressed, and the Apostle strikes straight at the one point which he intended to bring into relief. (Whatever there might be before men) there is no boasting before God.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-12 To meet the views of the Jews, the apostle first refers to the example of Abraham, in whom the Jews gloried as their most renowned forefather. However exalted in various respects, he had nothing to boast in the presence of God, being saved by grace, through faith, even as others. Without noticing the years which passed before his call, and the failures at times in his obedience, and even in his faith, it was expressly stated in Scripture that he believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness, Ge 15:6. From this example it is observed, that if any man could work the full measure required by the law, the reward must be reckoned as a debt, which evidently was not the case even of Abraham, seeing faith was reckoned to him for righteousness. When believers are justified by faith, their faith being counted for righteousness, their faith does not justify them as a part, small or great, of their righteousness; but as the appointed means of uniting them to Him who has chosen as the name whereby he shall be called, the Lord our Righteousness. Pardoned people are the only blessed people. It clearly appears from the Scripture, that Abraham was justified several years before his circumcision. It is, therefore, plain that this rite was not necessary in order to justification. It was a sign of the original corruption of human nature. And it was such a sign as was also an outward seal, appointed not only to confirm God's promises to him and to his seed, and their obligation to be the Lord's, but likewise to assure him of his being already a real partaker of the righteousness of faith. Thus Abraham was the spiritual forefather of all believers, who walked after the example of his obedient faith. The seal of the Holy Spirit in our sanctification, making us new creatures, is the inward evidence of the righteousness of faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if Abraham ... - This is the answer of the apostle. If Abraham was justified on the ground of his own merits, he would have reason to boast, or to claim praise. He might regard himself as the author of it, and take the praise to himself; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-4.htm">Romans 4:4</a>. The inquiry, therefore, was, whether in the account of the justification of Abraham, there was to be found any such statement of a reason for self-confidence and boasting.<p>But not before God - In the sight of God. That is, in his recorded judgment, he had no ground of boasting on account of works. To show this, the apostle appeals at once to the Scriptures, to show that there was no such record as that Abraham could boast that he was justified by his works. As God judges right in all cases, so it follows that Abraham had no just ground of boasting, and of course that he was not justified by his own works. The sense of this verse is well expressed by Calvin. "If Abraham was justified by his works, he might boast of his own merits. But he has no ground of boasting before God. Therefore he was not justified by works." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God&#8212;"If works were the ground of Abraham's justification, he would have matter for boasting; but as it is perfectly certain that he hath none in the sight of God, it follows that Abraham could not have been justified by works." And to this agree the words of Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He hath whereof to glory; </span> he hath cause or matter of glorying and boasting; he hath something from whence he may take occasion of so doing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But not before God; </span> something must be supplied to fill up the sense, i.e. he hath nothing whereof to glory before God. The argument of the apostle might be thus formed: If Abraham had obtained justification by works, he should have had somewhat whereof he might glory before God: but he had nothing whereof to glory before God; therefore he was not justified by works. God’s way of justifying sinners is such, as shuts out all glorying and boasting, as he had before laid down, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-27.htm" title="Where is boasting then?

That Abraham was not, and could not be justified by works, is clear from hence, that if this was his case, <p>he hath whereof to glory; which will be allowed him before men, on account of his pious life and conversation: <p>but not before God; who saw all the iniquity of his heart, and was privy to all his failings and infirmities: besides, glorying before God in a man's own works, is contrary to the scheme and method of God's grace; is excluded by the doctrine of faith; nor is there any place for glorying before God but in Christ, and his righteousness: if therefore Abraham had not that of which he could glory before God, he could not be justified by works in his sight: but does not the Apostle James say that he was justified by works, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm">James 2:21</a>? To this it may be replied, that the two apostles, Paul and James, are not speaking of the same thing: Paul speaks of justification before God, James of justification before men; Paul speaks of the justification of the person, James of the justification of a man's cause, as the truth of his faith, or the uprightness of his conduct; Paul speaks of works, as the causes of justification, James of them as the effects and evidences of faith; Paul had to do with the self-righteous, who trusted in their own works for justification, James with Gnostics, who slighted and neglected the performance of them.

The question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm" title="What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?">Romans 4:1</a> contained the negative sense, which had therefore necessarily to be limited by <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span>: “We may not assert that Abraham has obtained anything according to the flesh.” The reason for this is now assigned (<span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>): “<span class="ital">For, assuming that Abraham has been justified by works</span>” (as was the Jewish opinion[964]), “<span class="ital">he has cause for boasting</span>,” namely, that he has attained righteousness through his actions, <span class="ital">but</span> he has <span class="ital">not</span> this ground of boasting <span class="ital">with respect to God</span> (as if his justification were the <span class="ital">divine</span> act), since, namely, in the case supposed it is not <span class="ital">God</span> to whom he owes the justification, but on the contrary he has <span class="ital">himself</span> earned it, and God would simply have to acknowledge it as a human self-acquirement. <span class="ital">God</span> has not, in that supposed case, done anything for him, on account of which he might thus boast <span class="ital">with regard to God</span> as his justifier; for <span class="greekheb">ἡ τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἔργων πληρῶσις αὐτοὺς στεφανοῖ τοῦς ἐργαζομένους</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν δὲ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ φιλανθρωπίαν οὐ δείκνυσιν</span>, Theodoret. Comp also Chrysostom, Oecumenius, and Theophylact. Thus for the proper understanding of this difficult passage (Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">ἀσάφες τὸ εἰρημένον</span>) we must go back to the explanation of the Greek expositors, which is quite faithful both to the words and the context. Comp on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-3.htm" title="For what said the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness....">Romans 4:3-4</a>. This interpretation, now adopted also by Tholuck (comp Reithmayr and Th. Schott), has especially <span class="ital">this</span> advantage, that <span class="greekheb">ἐδικαιώθη</span> is not taken otherwise than in the entire development of the <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ</span>, not therefore as somewhat <span class="ital">indefinite and general</span> (“justus apparuit,” Grotius), in which case it would remain a question <span class="ital">by whom</span> Abraham was found righteous (Rückert, Philippi; comp Beza and others; also Grotius and Koppe, and, with trifling variation, de Wette, likewise Spohn in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1843, p. 429 ff., Volckmar, and others). That Abraham was justified <span class="ital">with</span> God was known to no Jew otherwise (comp <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/44-19.htm" title="Who kept the law of the most High, and was in covenant with him: he established the covenant in his flesh; and when he was proved, he was found faithful.">Sir 44:19</a> ff.; Manass. 8; Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xi. 5, 7; Eisenmenger, <span class="ital">entdeckt. Judenth</span>. I. p. 322, 343), and no reader could in accordance with the entire context understand <span class="greekheb">ἐδικαιώθη</span> otherwise, than in this definite sense, consequently in the solemn absolute sense of the Apostle (in opposition to Lipsius, <span class="ital">Rechtfertigungsl</span>. p. 35). The only question was, <span class="ital">whether</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἔργων</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἐκ πίστεως</span>. If we suppose the <span class="ital">former</span> case, it is indeed for Abraham worthy of all honour, and he may boast of that which he has himself achieved, but with <span class="ital">reference to God</span>, as if <span class="ital">He</span> had justified him, he has no ground for boasting.[970] Observe besides, that <span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span> is used not in the sense of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝΏΠΙΟΝ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">coram</span> (Hofmann: <span class="ital">overagainst</span>), or <span class="ital">apud</span> (Vulgate), but in accordance with the quite common usage of <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν</span> with the object of the thing (to have something to do, to say, to boast, to ask, to censure, etc.), and with specification <span class="ital">of the relation of reference to some one</span> through <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τινα</span>. The opposite of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΧΕΙΝ ΚΑΎΧΗΜΑ ΠΡΌς</span></span></span> is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΧΕΙΝ ΜΟΜΦῊΝ ΠΡΌς</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-13.htm" title=" Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you.">Colossians 3:13</a>. The <span class="ital">special mode</span> of the reference is invariably furnished by the context, which here, in accordance with the idea of <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ</span>, suggests the notion that God is the <span class="ital">bestower</span> of the blessing meant by <span class="greekheb">καύχημα</span>. <span class="ital">To that</span> the <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν καύχημα</span> of Abraham does <span class="ital">not</span> refer, if he was justified by <span class="ital">works</span>. In the latter case he cannot boast of himself: <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεὸς με ἐδίκαιωσε</span>, <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ τὸ δῶρον</span>. Reiche and Fritzsche, following Calvin, Calovius, and many others, have discovered here an <span class="ital">incomplete syllogism</span>, in which <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ οὐ πρὸς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεόν</span> is the minor premiss, and the conclusion is wanting, to this effect: “Si suis bene factis Dei favorem nactus est, habet quod apud Deum glorietur.…; sed <span class="ital">non</span> habet, quod apud Deum glorietur, quum libri s. propter <span class="ital">fidem</span>, non propter pulchre facta eum Deo probatum esse doceant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-3.htm" title="For what said the scripture?

If the words were interrogative, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ μή</span> must have been used instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛʼ Οὐ</span></span></span> (<span class="ital">but yet not before God?</span>) Hofmann, in consequence of his erroneous exposition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm" title="What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?">Romans 4:1</a>, supposes that Paul wishes to explain how he came to propose the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm" title="What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?">Romans 4:1</a>, and to regard an answer to it as necessary. What is here involved, namely, is nothing less than a contradiction between <span class="ital">what Christians say of themselves</span> (when they deny all possibility of becoming righteous by their own actions), and <span class="ital">what holds good of “an Abraham,” the father of the people of God</span>. If the latter has become righteous through his own action, he has glory, and <span class="ital">by this</span> very <span class="ital">circumstance</span> his <span class="ital">ancestorship</span> is distinguished from that of all others. But then the Scripture teaches that what God counted worthy in Abraham was his faith, and it is therefore clear that the glory which he has, if he has become righteous by works, is no glory in presence of God, and consequently <span class="ital">is not fitted to be the basis of his position in sacred history</span>. This is a chain of ideas imported into the passage; instead of which it was the object of the Apostle himself merely to set forth the simple proposition that Abraham was not justified by works, and not at all to speak of the mode in which the Christian ancestorship of the patriarch came to subsist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καύχημα</span> (comp on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-26.htm" title="That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.">Php 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm" title="Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.">Php 2:16</a>) is throughout the N.
