The expression is an instance of what is known in Greek as the “genitive of apposition,” but it is common in English. Thus we speak of the City <span class= "ital">of</span> London, the County <span class= "ital">of</span> Kent.<p>Abraham is the father (1) of faithful uncircumcised—he himself being so—and (2) of circumcised, <span class= "ital">but only</span> of faithful circumcised.<p><span class= "bld">A seal of the righteousness</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>—The Apostle here puts forth his view of the real import of circumcision. It was not (as so many of his contemporaries supposed) the cause or condition of Israel’s privileges so much as the sign or ratification of them. It ratified a state of things already existing when it was instituted. Hence, to those who inherited that state of things (justification by faith) the want of circumcision was no bar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:...">Romans 4:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And </span>— After he was justified; <span class="ital">he received the sign of circumcision </span>— Circumcision which was intended to be a sign, or token, of his being in covenant with God, and an emblem of that circumcision of the heart, which, even under that dispensation of divine grace, was, and still is, necessary to salvation. <span class="ital">A seal of the righteousness of faith </span>— An assurance on God’s part that he accounted him righteous, upon his believing, before he was circumcised. Circumcision seems to be called a seal, in allusion to the custom of affixing seals to written covenants, to render them firm. <span class="ital">That he might be the father of all them that believe </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With a true and lively faith; the father of all the faithful; <span class="ital">though they be not circumcised </span>— Though they have not that sign of their being in covenant with God, nor that seal of the truth of their faith, and of their being accounted righteous. “Hence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-14.htm" title="That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.">Galatians 3:14</a>. faith counted for righteousness is called <span class="ital">the blessing of Abraham, </span>and is said <span class="ital">to come on the Gentiles through Christ. </span>For the same purpose God ordered all Abraham’s male descendants to be circumcised, on the eighth day after their birth. The Israelitish children being thus early initiated into God’s covenant, their parents were thereby assured, that if, when grown up, they followed Abraham in his faith and obedience, they were, like him, to have their faith counted to them for righteousness, and be entitled to all the blessings of the covenant: or, if they died in infancy, that God would raise them from the dead, to enjoy the heavenly country, of which the earthly was the type. But the covenant with Abraham being in reality the gospel covenant, set forth in types and figures, according to the manner of ancient times, may we not from the use and efficacy of circumcision believe, that baptism, the rite of initiation into the Christian Church, is, like it, a seal of the gospel covenant, and a declaration on the part of God, that he will count the faith of the baptized person for righteousness? And that, like circumcision, it may be administered to infants, to assure the parents that their future faith shall be counted and rewarded as righteousness; or, if they die in infancy, that they shall be raised to eternal life? In this view the baptism of infants is a reasonable rite, and must afford the greatest consolation to all pious parents.” <span class="ital">And the father of circumcision </span>— Abraham received this rite by divine appointment, that he might also be the father of those who are circumcised, and believe as he did: for, in the covenant which God made with him, he constituted him the father of all believers; and whatever promises were made to him and his seed, were in reality made to believers of all nations; to all who <span class="ital">walk in the steps of that faith which he had being uncircumcised — </span>That is, who, like Abraham, exercise a continued faith, and who from faith live a life of obedience to God to the end of their days. To those who do not thus believe and obey, Abraham is not a father, neither are they his seed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-13.htm" title="For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith....">Romans 4:13-15</a> </span><span class="ital">For </span>— As if he had said, And it further appears that Abraham was righteous, or justified by faith only, and not by the works of the law, because <span class="ital">the promise that he should be the heir of the world </span>— Should have a numerous natural offspring, (and among them Christ, by whom blessedness was to be obtained,) who should inherit that rich and pleasant part of the world, Canaan, a type of heaven; and also that he should have a spiritual seed among all nations, all over the world; <span class="ital">was not to Abraham or to his seed </span>— To true believers; <span class="ital">through the law </span>— Of Moses, or any law except that of faith; was not made to him upon consideration of works done by him, and meriting that blessing; <span class="ital">but through the righteousness of faith </span>— Upon account of his faith, which rendered him a righteous person in a gospel sense, and was manifested especially by his offering Isaac, which was a distinguished act of faith, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-17.htm" title="By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,">Hebrews 11:17</a>; and on occasion of which God made those promises to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/22-17.htm" title="That in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is on the sea shore; and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;...">Genesis 22:17-18</a>.

All things were promised to him and them conjointly. <span class="ital">For if they </span>only <span class="ital">who are of the law</span> — Either of the law of Moses. or of the law of nature, who are righteous by their obedience to it; <span class="ital">be heirs </span>— The only persons that have a title to the promised inheritance and blessedness: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm" title="That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:">Ephesians 3:6</a> : <span class="ital">faith is made void </span>— There is no use of believing in Christ, and depending upon him alone for blessedness; <span class="ital">and the promise, </span>mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-13.htm" title="For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.">Romans 4:13</a>, <span class="ital">is made of none effect </span>— Can do us no good, is to no purpose. The argument stands thus: “If Abraham and his seed were made heirs of the world, through a righteousness arising from a perfect, unsinning obedience to the law, their faith is rendered useless in this transaction; and the promise by which they became heirs through favour, had no influence in procuring that blessing, they having merited the inheritance by their works.” <span class="ital">Because the law </span>— Of works, considered apart from that grace which, though it was in fact mingled with it, yet is, properly speaking, no part of it, is so difficult, and we so weak and sinful, that, instead of bringing us a blessing, it only <span class="ital">worketh wrath </span>— It becomes to us an occasion of wrath, and exposes us to punishment as transgressors. In other words, it reveals God’s wrath against transgressors, and binds them over to punishment for the transgression of it, and so begets fear of wrath, instead of conferring happiness. <span class="ital">For where there is no law </span>— Either revealed or intimated, or no law in force; <span class="ital">there is no transgression </span>— Of it; but the multiplication of precepts increases the danger of offending; and the clearer declaration of those precepts aggravates the guilt attending the violation of them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-12 To meet the views of the Jews, the apostle first refers to the example of Abraham, in whom the Jews gloried as their most renowned forefather. However exalted in various respects, he had nothing to boast in the presence of God, being saved by grace, through faith, even as others. Without noticing the years which passed before his call, and the failures at times in his obedience, and even in his faith, it was expressly stated in Scripture that he believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness, Ge 15:6. From this example it is observed, that if any man could work the full measure required by the law, the reward must be reckoned as a debt, which evidently was not the case even of Abraham, seeing faith was reckoned to him for righteousness. When believers are justified by faith, their faith being counted for righteousness, their faith does not justify them as a part, small or great, of their righteousness; but as the appointed means of uniting them to Him who has chosen as the name whereby he shall be called, the Lord our Righteousness. Pardoned people are the only blessed people. It clearly appears from the Scripture, that Abraham was justified several years before his circumcision. It is, therefore, plain that this rite was not necessary in order to justification. It was a sign of the original corruption of human nature. And it was such a sign as was also an outward seal, appointed not only to confirm God's promises to him and to his seed, and their obligation to be the Lord's, but likewise to assure him of his being already a real partaker of the righteousness of faith. Thus Abraham was the spiritual forefather of all believers, who walked after the example of his obedient faith. The seal of the Holy Spirit in our sanctification, making us new creatures, is the inward evidence of the righteousness of faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he received the sign ... - A sign is that by which any thing is shown, or represented. And circumcision thus showed that there was a covenant between Abraham and God; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1-10</a>. It became the public mark or token of the relation which he sustained to God.<p>A seal - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-33.htm">John 3:33</a>. A seal is that mark of wax or other substance, which is attached to an instrument of writing, as a deed, etc., to confirm, ratify it, or to make it binding. Sometimes instruments were sealed, or made authentic by stamping on them some word, letter, or device, which had been engraved on silver, or on precious stones. The seal or stamp was often worn as an ornament on the finger; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-8.htm">Esther 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-18.htm">Genesis 38:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-11.htm">Exodus 28:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a> To affix the seal, whether of wax, or otherwise, was to confirm contract or an engagement. In allusion to this, circumcision is called a seal of the covenant which God had made with Abraham. That is, he appointed this as a public attestation to the fact that he had previously approved of Abraham, and had made important promises to him.<p>Which he had, yet being circumcised - He believed <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>; was accepted, or justified; was admitted to the favor of God, and favored with clear and remarkable promises <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-1.htm">Genesis 17:1-9</a>, before he was circumcised. Circumcision, therefore, could have contributed neither to his justification, nor to the premises made to him by God.<p>That he might be the father ... - All this was done that Abraham might be held up as an example, or a model, of the very doctrine which the apostle was defending. The word "father" here is used evidently in a spiritual sense, as denoting that he was the ancestor of all true believers; that he was their model, and example. They are regarded as his children because they are possessed of his spirit; are justified in the same way, and are imitators of his example; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. In this sense the expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-9.htm">Luke 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>.<p>Though they be not circumcised - This was stated in opposition to the opinion of the Jews that all ought to be circumcised. As the apostle had shown that Abraham enjoyed the favor of God previous to his being circumcised, that is, without circumcision; so it followed that others might on the same principle also. This instance settles the point; and there is nothing which a Jew can reply to this.<p>That righteousness ... - That is, in the same way, by faith without works: that they might be accepted, and treated as righteous. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-12. Cometh this blessedness then, &c.&#8212;that is, "Say not, All this is spoken of the circumcised, and is therefore no evidence of God's general way of justifying men; for Abraham's justification took place long before he was circumcised, and so could have no dependence upon that rite: nay, 'the sign of circumcision' was given to Abraham as 'a seal' (or token) of the (justifying) righteousness which he had before he was circumcised; in order that he might stand forth to every age as the parent believer&#8212;the model man of justification by faith&#8212;after whose type, as the first public example of it, all were to be moulded, whether Jew or Gentile, who should thereafter believe to life everlasting."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The sign of circumcision; </span> or, circumcision, which is a sign.

(that is, to bring Christ down from above:)">Romans 10:6</a></span>, and the notes there. Circumcision is called a <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">seal, </span> because it was a confirmation of the covenant of grace, and the righteousness therein promised. The common use of a seal amongst men is to confirm and ratify a matter, and make it more firm and sure: it is joined often with an earnest, which is for the same end and purpose. The Corinthians’ conversion is said to be the seal of Paul’s apostleship; i.e. it was a confirmation of it, and made it more evident that he was sent of God. What the apostle says of an oath, that we may say of a seal; it is for confirmation, and for putting things out of controversy. When God made a promise to Abraham, he confirmed it with an oath; and when he made a covenant with him, and with his seed, he confirmed it by a seal, and that was circumcision, which he calls in Genesis the <span class="ital">convenant</span> of God, and here, the <span class="ital">seal</span> thereof. And what is said of circumcision is not spoken of it barely as circumcision, but as a sacrament; and it shows the nature and use of all sacraments, both of the Old Testament and New, that they are seals of the new covenant. That which the apostle mentions here of circumcision, hath nothing proper and peculiar in it to circumcision as such; but it may, with equal reason, be applied to any other sacrament: it belongs as well to the passover, yea, to baptism, and the Lord’s supper: e.g. The apostle first calls circumcision a <span class="ital">sign; </span> so was the passover, so is baptism, and the Lord’s supper. Again, he calls it <span class="ital">a seal of the righteousness of faith, </span> or of the new covenant, as before; and so is each of the other sacriments: take, for instance, the Lord’s supper; our Saviour calls the <span class="ital">cup</span> therein <span class="ital">the new testament, </span> or covenant, that is, it is a seal and confirmation thereof. And what is here affirmed of Abraham, may be affirmed as well of the eunuch, or the jailer, or any baptized person; he received the sign of baptism, a seal of the righteousness of faith, and of remission of sins, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That he might be the father of all them that believe; </span> i.e. that he might be known or declared to be the father of such: see the like phrase, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm" title="That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.">Matthew 5:45</a></span>. Though many of the fathers did believe before Abraham, yet none of them are said to be the fathers of the faithful, as Abraham was, because God made to none of them the like promise, concerning their posterity, as he did to Abraham. See the next verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he received the sign of circumcision,.... Or "the sign circumcision", as the Syriac version reads it, and so the Alexandrian copy, and two of Stephens's; that is, Abraham received at the hands of God, the commandment of circumcision, which was a "sign" or token of the covenant; not of grace, but of that peculiar covenant God made with Abraham and his natural seed, concerning their enjoyment of the land of Canaan; and which was a distinctive sign or badge, which distinguished the posterity of Abraham from other people, and was also a typical one; not of baptism, for circumcision was peculiar to Abraham's natural seed, whereas baptism is not, but was administered to Gentiles as well as Jews; circumcision was confined to males only, not so baptism; circumcision bears no likeness to, nor any resemblance with baptism, whereas there is always some likeness and agreement between the type and the antitype; besides, if this had been the case, circumcision would have ceased when baptism took place, whereas it is certain it did not, but continued in full force with the rest of the ceremonies until the death of Christ; and it is as certain, that "baptism" was administered and continued to be administered three or four years before that time; which fully demonstrates the falsehood of that assertion, that baptism succeeds or comes in the room of circumcision; whereas baptism was in full force before circumcision was out of date: but circumcision was a typical sign of Christ, as all the ceremonies of the law were, and of the shedding of his blood, to cleanse from all sin, original and actual, and also of the circumcision of the heart. And was, moreover, <p>a seal of the righteousness of faith; or which "sign" was "a seal"; and so it signifies the same as before;     "signs, so they call seals", says Harpocratian (f), and "to be signed", he says, is used, "instead of being sealed": or it may be expressive of something else, as that circumcision was a seal, not for secrecy, but for certainty; it being a confirmation, not merely of the sincerity of Abraham's faith, but of his justifying righteousness, which was not his faith, but that which his faith looked to; and <p>which he had, both faith and righteousness, <p>yet being uncircumcised: whence it follows, that he was not justified by his circumcision, but by a righteousness which he had before he was circumcised, or otherwise his circumcision could not have been a seal of it: though this clause, "which he had, yet being uncircumcised", may be rendered, "which should be in the uncircumcision", that is, in the uncircumcised Gentiles; and the sense be, that circumcision was a seal to Abraham, and gave assurance to him that he should be the father of many nations in a spiritual sense; and that the righteousness of faith which he had, should also come upon, and be imputed to the uncircumcised Gentiles; and accordingly it may be observed, that this seal was continued in full force on his natural seed, until this promise began to take place, and then it was abolished: this seal was broken off when the middle wall of partition was broken down, and the word of righteousness and faith, or the Gospel preaching justification by the righteousness of Christ, was ordered to be published to the Gentile world. It may be inquired whether circumcision being called a seal, will prove that baptism is a seal of the covenant? I answer, that circumcision was only a seal to Abraham of a peculiar covenant made with him, and of a particular promise made to him, and was it to be admitted a seal of the covenant of grace, it will not prove baptism to be such; since, as has been observed, baptism does not succeed it in place, in time, and use; and could this be allowed that it succeeds it, and is a seal of the righteousness of faith, as that was, it can only be a seal to them that have both faith and righteousness, and not to them that have neither; it would only at most be a seal to believers. But, alas! not ordinances, but other things more valuable than they, are the seals of the covenant, and of believers; the blood of Christ is the seal, and the only seal of the covenant of grace, by which its promises and blessings are ratified and confirmed; and the Holy Spirit is the only earnest, pledge, seal, and sealer of the saints, until the day of redemption. The apostle uses the word "seal" concerning circumcision, it being a word his countrymen made use of when they spoke of it, thus paraphrasing on Sol 3:8; they say (g), <p>"everyone of them was sealed, , "with the seal of circumcision" upon their flesh, as Abraham was sealed in his flesh:'' <p>that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that is, his circumcision was a seal unto him that he should be so, which explains and confirms the sense of the former clause; not a father of the uncircumcised Gentiles by natural generation, for so he was only the father of the Jews, but of them as they were believers; and not so called because he was the author of their faith, but because they have the same sort of faith he had: <p>that righteousness might be imputed to them also; not Abraham's faith and righteousness, nor their own, but the righteousness of Christ received by faith, which is unto all, and upon all them that believe, without any difference of Jew or Gentile. Now when the apostle styles Abraham the father of "all" believers, even of uncircumcised ones, he says no other than what the Jews frequently own. Says one (h) of them, speaking of the Ishmaelites; <p>"they are the seed of Abraham, who was , "the head of them that believe?"'' <p>and says (i) another, <p>"Hagar might bring the firstfruits, and read, as it is said to Abraham, "a father of, many nations have I made thee", <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>; for he is   , "the father of the whole world", who enter under the wings of the Shekinah;'' <p>and says the same writer elsewhere (k), having mentioned the above passage, <p>"they said in times past, thou wast the father of the Syrians, but now thou art "the father of the whole world"; wherefore every stranger may say this, "as thou hast sworn to our fathers", <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-20.htm">Micah 7:20</a>; for Abraham was "the father of the whole world"; seeing, , "he has taught the true faith".'' <p>The apostle reasons on what they themselves allow, to prove that the blessedness of justification comes not only upon the Jews, but upon the Gentiles also. <p>(f) Lexicon in Decem Rhetores, p. 266.

It is therefore to be rendered: And <span class="ital">a sign, which took place through circumcision</span>, a signature which was given to him in the fact that he was circumcised, he received as seal, etc. The <span class="ital">genitive</span> is thus to be taken simply as <span class="ital">completing</span> the notion of <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> as <span class="ital">defining it more precisely</span> as respects its modal expression.

Thus the Jewish conception of the national-theocratic childship of Abraham is elevated and enlarged by Paul (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm" title="And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-37.htm" title="I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.">John 8:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father.

For Abraham’s righteousness through faith was attained, when as yet there was no distinction between circumcised and uncircumcised; and to this mode of becoming just before God, independent of external conditions, Christianity by its <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗ ἘΚ ΠΊΣΤΕΩς</span></span></span> leads back again, and continues it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙʼ ἈΚΡΟΒ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>] <span class="ital">with foreskin</span>, although they are uncircumcised.

On the contrary, he received a <span class="ital">sign</span> in circumcision a <span class="ital">seal</span> of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised. Both sign (<span class="greekheb">אוֹת</span>) and seal (<span class="greekheb">חוֹתָם</span>) are frequently used by Rabbinical writers to describe circumcision as a symbol or pledge that one is in covenant with God. So even of heathens: “Og was circumcised, and Moses feared <span class="greekheb">מפני אות ברית שׁלו</span>, <span class="ital">propter signum foederis ejus</span>”. But usually of Jews: “Jonah shewed Leviathan <span class="ital">sigillum</span> (<span class="greekheb">חותמו</span>) <span class="ital">Abrahami patris nostri</span>”.

With <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναι</span> the Divine purpose in this relation of circumcision to justification in the case of Abraham is explained. Things were ordered as has been described that he might be father of all that believe while uncircumcised (as he himself did)—that the righteousness in question might be imputed to them; and father of circumcision (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, of persons circumcised) in the case of those who are not only circumcised, but also walk in the steps of the faith which he had while not circumcised. It was God’s intention that Abraham should be the representative and typical believer, in whom all believers without distinction should recognise their spiritual father; the Divine method of justification was to be inaugurated and illustrated in him, as it should hold good for all who were to be justified: accordingly the whole process took place antecedent to his circumcision, and in no circumstances has circumcision any essential relation to this great blessing. For its true meaning and advantage see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm" title="For circumcision truly profits, if you keep the law: but if you be a breaker of the law, your circumcision is made uncircumcision.">Romans 2:25</a>.
