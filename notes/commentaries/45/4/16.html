A righteousness by the merit of works, or by perfect obedience to the law of nature, or of Moses, “being unattainable by men, the inheritance is by a righteousness of faith, that, being a free gift, it might be bestowed in the manner, and on the persons, God saw fit; namely, on believers of all nations, whether the objects of their faith were more or less extensive, and whether their good works were more or fewer; for in the faith and works of believers there must be great differences, according to the mental endowments and outward advantages bestowed on each. In this passage, by the most just reasoning, the apostle hath overthrown the narrow notion of bigots, who confine the mercy of God within the pale of this or that church; and by a noble liberality of sentiment, he hath declared that all who imitate that faith and piety which Abraham exercised uncircumcised, shall, like him, obtain the inheritance, through the free favour of God by Jesus Christ.” That <span class="ital">the promise might be sure </span>— Might be firm and secure; <span class="ital">to all the </span>believing <span class="ital">seed </span>of Abraham; <span class="ital">not </span>to that <span class="ital">only which is of the law, </span>&c. — “Here the apostle teaches, that Abraham had two kinds of seed; one by natural descent, called <span class="ital">his seed </span>by the law, and another by faith: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-26.htm" title="For you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:26</a>. To the natural seed the promise of the earthly Canaan was made; but to the seed by faith, the spiritual seed, the promise of a heavenly country, typified by the earthly one, was given. And to each the promise that was made to them was sure.” <span class="ital">As it is written, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm" title="And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.">Genesis 12:5</a>, <span class="ital">I have made thee a father of many nations — </span>That is, as I have received thee into favour upon thy believing, so many of several nations, both Jews and Gentiles, shall receive favour from me by believing, and so be justified in the way thou art: <span class="ital">before him whom he believed, even God </span>— Though before men nothing of this appeared, those nations being yet unborn. To illustrate the greatness of Abraham’s faith, and to show with what propriety he was made the father of all believers, the apostle in these words observes, that the principles on which he believed the Lord, were proper views of his almighty power, and other perfections. <span class="ital">Who quickeneth the dead — </span>The dead are not dead to him.

It points at Christ, and it refers to the promise, Ge 12:3. In Thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. The law worketh wrath, by showing that every transgressor is exposed to the Divine displeasure. As God intended to give men a title to the promised blessings, so he appointed it to be by faith, that it might be wholly of grace, to make it sure to all who were of the like precious faith with Abraham, whether Jews or Gentiles, in all ages. The justification and salvation of sinners, the taking to himself the Gentiles who had not been a people, were a gracious calling of things which are not, as though they were; and this giving a being to things that were not, proves the almighty power of God. The nature and power of Abraham's faith are shown. He believed God's testimony, and looked for the performance of his promise, firmly hoping when the case seemed hopeless. It is weakness of faith, that makes a man lie poring on the difficulties in the way of a promise. Abraham took it not for a point that would admit of argument or debate. Unbelief is at the bottom of all our staggerings at God's promises. The strength of faith appeared in its victory over fears. God honours faith; and great faith honours God. It was imputed to him for righteousness. Faith is a grace that of all others gives glory to God. Faith clearly is the instrument by which we receive the righteousness of God, the redemption which is by Christ; and that which is the instrument whereby we take or receive it, cannot be the thing itself, nor can it be the gift thereby taken and received. Abraham's faith did not justify him by its own merit or value, but as giving him a part in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - In view of the course of reasoning which has been pursued.

Abraham’s seed is of two sorts. One sort is of the law, to wit, the Jews. Another sort is of such as walk in the steps of Abraham’s faith, whether Jews or Gentiles. To all these the promise must be sure; which cannot be, if the law be made the condition or the means of the inheritance. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace,.... Meaning either the promise of being heir of the world, or the inheritance itself, or adoption which gives heirship, or remission of Sin, or the blessing of justification, either and all of these are of faith; not as the cause or condition of them, but as the means of God's fixing and appointing to be the recipient of all and each of them: which is done, "that it might be by grace"; appear to be of the free grace and favour of God, as each of these blessings are: forasmuch as every blessing is received by faith, it is manifest it must be by grace; since faith itself is a gift of God's grace, and lies purely in receiving favours at the hand of God, to whom it gives all the glory of them: and this is done with a further view, <p>to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed. The promise of the above blessings, particularly of the inheritance which is made in the covenant of grace, ordered in all things and sure, and which could not be disannulled by the law that came after it; this being by faith and of grace, and not of works, nor at all depending upon them, becomes sure to all believers, to all Abraham's spiritual seed: <p>not to that only which is of the law; to the Jews, who are said to be of the law, in distinction to the Gentiles who were without it; and designs such of them as were believers in Christ, and to whom the Gospel was the power of God unto salvation; to these the promise was, and was sure, and not to them only: <p>but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; to the Gentiles, who though they are not by natural descent from Abraham, yet are of the same faith with him, and so are his seed in a spiritual sense: <p>who is the father of us all; whether Jews or Gentiles, who are Christ's, and so Abraham's spiritual seed, and heirs of eternal life, according to the free promise of grace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{14}</span> Therefore <i>it is</i> of faith, that <i>it might be</i> by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> seed; <span class="cverse3">{15}</span> not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</span><p>(14) The conclusion of this argument: the salvation and justification of the posterity of Abraham (that is, of the Church which is composed of all believers) proceeds from faith which lays hold on the promise made to Abraham, and which promise Abraham himself first of all laid hold on.<p>(l) To all the believers.<p>(15) That is to say, not only of those who believe and are also circumcised according to the law, but of those also who without circumcision and with respect of faith only, are counted among the children of Abraham.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-16.htm" title="Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,">Romans 4:16</a> f. <span class="greekheb">Διὰ τοῦτο</span>] Inference from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm" title="Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.">Romans 4:15</a>, consequently from the wrath-operating nature of the law, on account of which it is so utterly incapable of being the condition of the <span class="greekheb">κληρονομία</span>, that the latter must on the contrary result from the opposite of the law—from faith, etc. Comp on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-14.htm" title="For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:">Romans 4:14</a> f.

This explanation (followed also by Rückert and Philippi) is perfectly faithful to the sense of the words, and as much in harmony with the vividly realised situation of Abraham as it is appropriate to the parallelism; for the latter is <span class="ital">climactic</span>, leading from the <span class="greekheb">νεκροῖς</span> to the <span class="greekheb">τὰ μὴ ὄντα</span>. <span class="greekheb">καλεῖν</span>, like <span class="greekheb">קרא</span>, does not here mean to <span class="ital">name</span> (Hofmann, comp Loesner and Benecke), which would refer to the <span class="ital">name of father</span> pronounced by God and have in view the divine <span class="ital">knowledge</span>, but on the contrary, correlative with the mighty <span class="greekheb">ζωοποιεῖν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νεκρ</span>.

Rigalt. where it is said of the painter, that he represents <span class="greekheb">τὰ μὴ ὄντα ὡς ὄντα</span>. Paul could also have, like Clement, <span class="ital">Cor.</span> II. 1, used <span class="greekheb">τὰ οὐκ ὄντα</span> (the non-existent, Xen. <span class="ital">Mem.</span> ii. 2, 3), as the contradictory antithesis of <span class="greekheb">τὰ ὄντα</span> (comp also Plat. <span class="ital">Rep.</span> p. 476 E); but the negation is conceived subjectively, from the standpoint of the subject who calls: he calls the things, which he knows as non-existent, as if they were. Comp Xen. <span class="ital">Anab.</span> iv. 4, 15, and Kühner <span class="ital">in loc</span>[1068]; Baeumlein, <span class="ital">Partik</span>. p. 278. Still what Delitzsch, <span class="ital">Psychol.</span> p. 37 f., deduces from <span class="greekheb">τὰ μὴ ὄντα</span>—that that which enters into historical existence was not previously an absolute nothing, but an object of divine knowledge—is based on the common conception of <span class="greekheb">καλεῖν</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">creative</span> activity, which is erroneous. No doubt <span class="greekheb">καλεῖν</span>, as is well known, often denotes the <span class="ital">creating</span> call of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-12.htm" title="And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:">Isaiah 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm" title="Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the beginning?

In this case we should have to think by no means of the historical <span class="ital">Acts of creation out of nothing</span> (Piscator, Estius and others), but rather, on account of the <span class="ital">present</span> participle, either of the <span class="ital">continuous</span> creative activity (Köllner), or (better still on account of the parallel of <span class="greekheb">ζωοπ</span>.) of an <span class="ital">abiding characteristic</span> of God generally, from which no time is excluded. But this whole interpretation of <span class="greekheb">καλεῖν</span> is set aside here by <span class="greekheb">ὡς ὄντα</span>. For <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> cannot be taken for <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> (Luther, Wolf, and others), because an use so utterly isolated in the N. T. is in itself very improbable, and because, where <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> stands in classic authors in the sense of <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>, it is only so used in reference to <span class="ital">persons</span> (Hermann, <span class="ital">a</span>[1070]<span class="ital"> Viger.</span> p. 853; Poppo, <span class="ital">a</span>[1071]<span class="ital"> Thuc.</span> III. 1, p. 318 ff.), or, at the most, where what is personal is represented by neuter objects; see Döderlein, <span class="ital">philolog</span>. <span class="ital">Beitr.</span> p. 303 ff. Some desire <span class="greekheb">ὡς ὄντα</span> to be taken for <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐσόμενα</span> (de Wette), or as a summary expression for <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εἶναι ὡς ὄντα</span> (Reiche, Köllner, Tholuck, de Wette, Bisping), but these expedients are arbitrary in themselves, and, in the case of the latter especially—seeing that <span class="greekheb">ὄντα</span> would have to be taken in the sense of the result, as only adjectives are elsewhere used (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-43.htm" title="When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.">Matthew 12:43</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-16.htm" title="Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,...">Romans 4:16-22</a>. The Apostle can now develop, without further interruption or digression, his idea of the representative (and therefore universal) character of Abraham’s justification. The New Testament cannot be said to subvert the Old if the method of justification is the same under both. Nay, it establishes the Old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law.">Romans 3:31</a>).

That is to say, the justification was ‘according to grace,’ for it treated man as <span class="ital">having what he had not</span>—meritorious righteousness.” We might of course supply “the promise,” or “the inheritance,” instead of “justification,” as the subject in these clauses. But the latter idea is so much the more prominent, that it is the safer suggestion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sure</span>] i.e. not imperilled by the conditions of the Law for the Jewish believer, and by the lack of its privileges for the Gentile believer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not to that only</span>] The Gr. has grammatical difficulties, but the sense is practically as in E. V. The “seed” is regarded as in its two great divisions; and here first, that which is “of the law,” i.e. Jewish believers, not as really having a claim from the law, but <span class="ital">taken as having one</span>, to bring out the validity of the claim of faith on the Gentiles’ part.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the faith of Abraham</span>] Abraham is here the example of <span class="ital">manifestly extra-legal</span> faith, and therefore the case in point for the Gentile.
