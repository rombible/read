Whatever the persons in authority over us themselves may be, yet the just power they have, must be submitted to and obeyed. In the general course of human affairs, rulers are not a terror to honest, quiet, and good subjects, but to evil-doers. Such is the power of sin and corruption, that many will be kept back from crimes only by the fear of punishment. Thou hast the benefit of the government, therefore do what thou canst to preserve it, and nothing to disturb it. This directs private persons to behave quietly and peaceably where God has set them, 1Ti 2:1,2. Christians must not use any trick or fraud. All smuggling, dealing in contraband goods, withholding or evading duties, is rebellion against the express command of God. Thus honest neighbours are robbed, who will have to pay the more; and the crimes of smugglers, and others who join with them, are abetted. It is painful that some professors of the gospel should countenance such dishonest practices. The lesson here taught it becomes all Christians to learn and practise, that the godly in the land will always be found the quiet and the peaceable in the land, whatever others are.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For this cause - Because they are appointed by God; for the sake of conscience, and in order to secure the execution of the laws. As they are appointed by God, the tribute which is needful for their support becomes an act of homage to God, an act performed in obedience to his will, and acceptable to him.<p>Tribute also - Not only be subject <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-5.htm">Romans 13:5</a>, but pay what may be necessary to support the government. "Tribute" properly denotes the "tax," or annual compensation, which was paid by one province or nation to a superior, as the price of protection, or as an acknowledgment of subjection. The Romans made all conquered provinces pay this "tribute;" and it would become a question whether it was "right" to acknowledge this claim, and submit to it. Especially would this question be agitated by the Jews and by Jewish Christians. But on the principle which the apostle had laid down <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>, it was right to do it, and was demanded by the very purposes of government. In a larger sense, the word "tribute" means any tax paid on land or personal estate for the support of the government.<p>For they are God's ministers - His servants; or they are appointed by him. As the government is "his" appointment, we should contribute to its support as a matter of conscience, because we thus do honor to the arrangement of God. It may be observed here, also, that the fact that civil rulers are the ministers of God, invests their character with great sacredness, and should impress upon "them" the duty of seeking to do his will, as well as on others the duty of submitting to them.<p>Attending continually - As they attend to this, and devote their time and talents to it, it is proper that they should receive a suitable support. It becomes then a duty for the people to contribute cheerfully to the necessary expenses of the government. If those taxes should be unjust and oppressive, yet, like other evils, they are to be submitted to, until a remedy can be found in a proper way. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7.

When he says, they attend <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">continually upon this very thing, </span> the meaning is not, they attend always upon the receiving of tribute; but it is to be understood of the duty of magistrates, which is, to be continually promoting the good and welfare of their subjects; to encourage the good, and punish the evil-doer, which is the very thing he had been before speaking of. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For, for this cause pay you tribute also,.... To show that we are subject to the higher powers, and as a proof and evidence of our subjection to them, we do and ought to pay tribute to them, to support them in their office and dignity; and this is done not for fear of trouble, of distress on goods and estate, or imprisonment of person, but for conscience sake: payment of taxes is not a mere matter of prudence, and done to avoid dangerous consequence, but is and ought to be a case of conscience; whatever is anyone's due, and of right belongs to him, conscience dictates it ought to be paid him; as therefore it tells a man, that whatever is God's should be rendered to him, so whatever is Caesar's, should be given him; and indeed to do otherwise, to refuse to pay tribute, or by any fraudulent means to deprive the civil magistrate of his due, is not only to do an injury to him, but to the whole body politic, which has a greater concern therein than he himself; and such a person forfeits all right and claim to his protection: <p>for they are God's ministers. This is another reason why tribute should be paid them, not only to testify subjection to them, and keep conscience clear, but because they are called unto, and put into this high office by God; for promotion to such honour and high places comes not from east, west, north, or south; but is by the providence of God, who puts down, and sets up at pleasure; they are his vicegerents, they act under him, are in his stead, and represent his majesty; and therefore, in some sort, what is done to them is done to him: <p>attending continually upon this very thing; not of laying, collecting, and receiving tribute, but of service and ministry under God, for the welfare of their subjects; for rightly to administer the office of magistracy requires great pains, care, diligence, and assiduity; and as great wisdom and thoughtfulness in making laws for the good of the body, so a diligent constant concern to put them in execution, to secure the lives of subjects from cut throats and murderers, and their properties and estates from thieves and robbers; and they are not only obliged diligently to attend to such service at home, but to keep a good lookout abroad, and penetrate into, and watch the designs of foreign enemies, to defend from their invasions, and fight for their country; that the inhabitants thereof may live peaceable and quiet lives, enjoying their respective rights and privileges; and since therefore civil government is a business of so much care, and since our rulers are so solicitous, and constantly concerned for our good, and which cannot be done without great expense, as well as diligence, we ought cheerfully to pay tribute to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> For this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</span><p>(8) He sums up the main thing, in which consists the obedience of subjects.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-6.htm" title="For for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually on this very thing.">Romans 13:6</a>. <span class="ital">For on this account you pay taxes</span>—this is the <span class="ital">confirmation</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-5.htm" title="Why you must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.">Romans 13:5</a>, <span class="ital">from the actually subsisting payment of taxes;</span> <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> retains its sense assigning a reason, and the emphatic <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> (<span class="ital">from this</span> ground) is exactly in accordance with the context: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οὐ μόνον διὰ τὴν ὀργὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ διὰ τὴν συνείδησιν ἀνάγκη ἐστιν ὑποτάσσεσθαι</span>.

The thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm" title="For he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that does evil.">Romans 13:4</a>, that the magistracy is <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ διάκονος</span>, is here <span class="ital">by way of climax</span> more precisely defined through <span class="greekheb">λειτουργοί</span> (which is therefore <span class="ital">prefixed</span> with emphasis) according to the <span class="ital">official sacredness</span> of this relation of service, and that conformably to the <span class="ital">Christian</span> view of the magisterial calling. Accordingly, those who rule, in so far as they serve the divine counsel and will, and employ their strength and activity to this end, are to be regarded as persons whose administration has the character of a divinely consecrated <span class="ital">sacrificial service</span>, a <span class="ital">priestly</span> nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Php 2:17</a>, <span class="ital">et al</span>.).

Incorrectly as regards linguistic usage, Reiche, Köllner, Olshausen take <span class="greekheb">προσκαρτ</span>. to be the subject, in which case certainly the article before the participle would be quite indispensable (Reiche erroneously appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-16.htm" title="So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.">Matthew 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-14.htm" title="For many are called, but few are chosen.">Matthew 22:14</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span>] <span class="ital">Telic</span> direction not of <span class="greekheb">λειτουργ</span>. (Hofmann), but of <span class="greekheb">προσκαρτ</span>.: <span class="ital">for this very object</span>, by which is meant not the administration of <span class="ital">tax-paying</span> (Olshausen, Philippi, and older interpreters), but the just mentioned <span class="greekheb">λειτουργεῖν τῷ Θεῷ</span>, in which vocation, so characteristically <span class="ital">sacred</span>, the magistracy is continually and assiduously active, and the subject gives to it the means of being so, namely, taxes. Thus the payment of taxes is placed by Paul under the highest point of view of a religious conscientious duty, so that by means of it the divine vocation of the magistracy to provide a constantly active <span class="ital">sacrificial cultus</span> of God is promoted and facilitated. If <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span> was to be referred to the administration of taxes, this would not indeed be “nonsensical” (Hofmann), but the emphatic mode of expression <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span> would be without due motive, nor could we easily perceive why Paul should have selected the verb <span class="greekheb">προσκαρτ</span>., which expresses the moral notion <span class="ital">perseverare</span>. The reference of it to the nearest great thought, <span class="greekheb">λειτουργοὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., excludes, the more weighty and appropriate that it is, any other reference, even that of Hofmann, that <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span> points back to the same proposition as <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Instead of <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span>, Paul might have said <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ τούτῳ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-12.htm" title="Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;">Romans 12:12</a>); he has, however, conceived <span class="greekheb">προσκαρτ</span>. absolutely, and given with <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> the definition of its aim.
