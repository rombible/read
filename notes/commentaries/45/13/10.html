They are also to stand aloof from all venturesome speculations and rash engagements, and whatever may expose them to the danger of not rendering to all their due. Do not keep in any one's debt. Give every one his own. Do not spend that on yourselves, which you owe to others. But many who are very sensible of the trouble, think little of the sin, of being in debt. Love to others includes all the duties of the second table. The last five of the ten commandments are all summed up in this royal law, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; with the same sincerity that thou lovest thyself, though not in the same measure and degree. He that loves his neighbour as himself, will desire the welfare of his neighbour. On this is built that golden rule, of doing as we would be done by. Love is a living, active principle of obedience to the whole law. Let us not only avoid injuries to the persons, connexions, property, and characters of men; but do no kind or degree of evil to any man, and study to be useful in every station of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Love worketh no ill ... - Love would seek to do him good; of course it would prevent all dishonesty and crime toward others. It would prompt to justice, truth, and benevolence. If this law were engraved on every man's heart, and practiced in his life, what a change would it immediately produce in society! If all people would at once "abandon" what is suited to "work ill" to others, what an influence would it have on the business and commercial affairs of people. How many plans of fraud and dishonesty would it at once arrest. How many schemes would it crush. It would silence the voice of the slanderer; it would stay the plans of the seducer and the adulterer; it would put an end to cheating, and fraud, and all schemes of dishonest gain. The gambler desires the property of his neighbor without any compensation; and thus works "ill" to him. The dealer in "lotteries" desires property for which he has never toiled, and which must be obtained at the expense and loss of others. And there are many "employments" all whose tendency is to work "ill" to a neighbor. This is pre-eminently true of the traffic in "ardent spirits." It cannot do him good, and the almost uniform result is to deprive him of his property, health, reputation, peace, and domestic comfort. He that sells his neighbor liquid fire, knowing what must be the result of it, is not pursuing a business which works no ill to him; and love to that neighbor would prompt him to abandon the traffic; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a>, "Wo unto him that giveth his neighbor drink, that putteth thy bottle to him, and makest him drink also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness."<p>Therefore ... - "Because" love does no harm to another, it is "therefore" the fulfilling of the Law, implying that all that the Law requires is to "love" others.<p>Is the fulfilling - Is the "completion," or meets the requirements of the Law. The Law of God on this "head," or in regard to our duty to our neighbor, requires us to do justice toward him, to observe truth, etc. "All" this will be met by "love;" and if people truly "loved" others, all the demands of the Law would be satisfied.<p>Of the law - Of the Law of Moses, but particularly the Ten Commandments. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Love worketh no ill to his&#8212;or, "one's"<p>neighbour; therefore, &c.&#8212;As love, from its very nature, studies and delights to please its objects, its very existence is an effectual security against our wilfully injuring him. Next follow some general motives to the faithful discharge of all these duties.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse is an argument to prove what was proposed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-8.htm" title="Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.">Romans 13:8</a></span>.

When he saith, Love doth no hurt, this is implied, that it doth good to his neighbour. Where only negatives are mentioned, the affirmative also is included; and the negative only is set down in this place, that it may the better correspond with the foregoing verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour,.... That is, the man that truly loves his neighbour, will contrive no ill against him, nor do any to him; he will not injure his person, nor defile his bed, nor deprive or defraud him of his substance; or do hurt to his character, bear false testimony against him, or covet with an evil covetousness anything that is his; but, on the contrary, will do him all the good he is capable of: <p>therefore love is the fulfilling of the law: so far as a man loves his neighbour, he acts agreeably to the law, and the particular precepts of it above mentioned: what the apostle says of love to the neighbour, the Jews frequently say of love to God; <p>"he that loveth God (they say (d))  , "hath fulfilled the decalogue", both above and below.'' <p>And again (e), <p>"there is no service like the love of God, R.

Observe, moreover, that <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> is not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">πλήρωσις</span>, but in the love of one’s neighbour that whereby the law is fulfilled has <span class="ital">taken place</span> and is <span class="ital">realized</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The commentary on this point, how love works no ill to one’s neighbour, is given by Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,...">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-10.htm" title="Love works no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.">Romans 13:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη</span> … <span class="greekheb">κακὸν οὐκ ἐργάζεται</span>. This is all that is formally required by the law as quoted above (<span class="greekheb">οὐ μοιχεύσεις</span>, etc.): therefore love is <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα νόμου</span>, law’s fulfilment. Of course love is an inspiration rather than a restraint, and transcends law as embodied in merely negative commandments; but the form in which the law actually existed determines the form in which the Apostle expresses himself. It is apparent once more that <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> is the Mosaic law, and not law in general; it is from it the prohibitions are derived on the ground of which the Apostle argues, and to it therefore we must apply his conclusion, <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα οὖν νόμου ἡ ἀγάπη</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">Love worketh</span>, &c.] Such is its very nature,—to avoid the kind of acts which as a fact the Law forbids. Therefore Love (“Charity,” 1 Corinthians 13, &c.), though its action is not, strictly speaking, originated by the Law, but the necessary result of its being Love, is in perfect harmony with the Law—which is the precept of Eternal Love; and so is the surest secret of fulfilling it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his neighbour</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">the neighbour:</span> the neighbour in each case.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the fulfilling</span>] Better, <span class="bld">the fulfilment</span>. The Gr. word means not the <span class="ital">process</span> of obedience, but the <span class="ital">result of the process;</span> obedience as an accomplished fact. For this view of Love, see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-8.htm" title="Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.">Romans 13:8</a>; “hath fulfilled.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The doctrine of this passage (that to love one another is the true secret of obedience to the Divine Law,) is in perfect harmony with the doctrine of the “bondservice” of the Christian, as stated in ch. 6; for the true secret of that bondservice is adoring gratitude for emancipation from the slavery of sin; a gratitude which after all does but joyfully recognize the unchangeable <span class="ital">fact</span> of the <span class="ital">lawful claim</span> of the Creator and Redeemer to the devotion of the whole man. Thus love to God is in fact the full acceptance of His will, His law; and love to others for His sake is therefore the sure way to carry out that law in its special precepts regarding duty to fellow-Christians and fellow-men.—Manifestly the law is to be the authoritative guide of “love.” Love is not “a law unto itself,” but the “fulfilment” of the definite and objective rule of God’s revealed will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-10.htm" title="Love works no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.">Romans 13:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κακὸν οὐκ</span>, <span class="ital">no evil</span>) Moreover, most duties are of a negative character; or at least, where there is no one injured, positive duties are pleasantly and spontaneously performed. Where there is true love, there a man is not guilty of adultery, theft, lying, covetousness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Romans 13:9</a>.[140]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[140] <span class="greekheb">Οὖν</span>, <span class="ital">then</span>) Love is not extinguished of itself; for well-doing, unless it meets with some obstruction from some evil, goes on without interruption: hence it is that from the avoiding of evil the fulfilment of the law, which also includes good, is derived [is made to flow].—V. g.</body></html>
