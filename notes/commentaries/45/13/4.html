It was carried before them in processions, and on other important occasions.<p>It is clear from this passage that capital punishment is sanctioned by Scripture. At the same time its abolition is not excluded, as the abolition of slavery was not excluded, if the gradual development of Christian principle should seem to demand it. Whether or not capital punishment ought to be abolished, is a question for jurists, publicists, and statesmen. The theologian, as such, has no decision to give either way.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-7 The grace of the gospel teaches us submission and quiet, where pride and the carnal mind only see causes for murmuring and discontent. Whatever the persons in authority over us themselves may be, yet the just power they have, must be submitted to and obeyed. In the general course of human affairs, rulers are not a terror to honest, quiet, and good subjects, but to evil-doers. Such is the power of sin and corruption, that many will be kept back from crimes only by the fear of punishment. Thou hast the benefit of the government, therefore do what thou canst to preserve it, and nothing to disturb it. This directs private persons to behave quietly and peaceably where God has set them, 1Ti 2:1,2. Christians must not use any trick or fraud. All smuggling, dealing in contraband goods, withholding or evading duties, is rebellion against the express command of God. Thus honest neighbours are robbed, who will have to pay the more; and the crimes of smugglers, and others who join with them, are abetted. It is painful that some professors of the gospel should countenance such dishonest practices. The lesson here taught it becomes all Christians to learn and practise, that the godly in the land will always be found the quiet and the peaceable in the land, whatever others are.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The minister of God - The "servant" of God he is appointed by God to do his will, and to execute his purposes. "To thee." For your benefit.<p>For good - That is, to protect you in your rights; to vindicate your name, person, or property; and to guard your liberty, and secure to you the results of your industry. The magistrate is not appointed directly to "reward" people, but they "practically" furnish a reward by protecting and defending them, and securing to them the interests of justice.<p>If thou do that ... - That is, if any citizen should do evil.<p>Be afraid - Fear the just vengeance of the laws.<p>For he beareth not the sword in vain - The "sword" is an instrument of punishment, as well as an emblem of war. Princes were accustomed to wear a sword as an emblem of their authority; and the "sword" was often used for the purpose of "beheading," or otherwise punishing the guilty. The meaning of the apostle is, that he does not wear this badge of authority as an unmeaningful show, but that it will be used to execute the laws. As this is the design of the power intrusted to him, and as he will "exercise" his authority, people should be influenced "by fear" to keep the law, even if there were no better motive.<p>A revenger ... - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, vengeance is said to belong to God. Yet he "executes" his vengeance by means of subordinate agents. It belongs to him to take vengeance by direct judgments, by the plague, famine, sickness, or earthquakes; by the appointment of magistrates; or by letting loose the passions of people to prey upon each other. When a magistrate inflicts punishment on the guilty, it is to be regarded as the act of God taking vengeance "by him;" and on this principle only is it right for a judge to condemn a man to death. It is not because one man has by nature any right over the life of another, or because "society" has any right collectively which it has not as individuals; but because "God" gave life, and because he has chosen to take it away when crime is committed by the appointment of magistrates, and not by coming forth himself visibly to execute the laws. Where "human" laws fail, however, he often takes vengeance into his own hands, and by the plague, or some signal judgments, sweeps the guilty into eternity.<p>To execute wrath - For an explanation of the word "wrath," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>. It denotes here "punishment," or the just execution of the laws. It may be remarked that this verse is an "incidental" proof of the propriety of "capital punishment." The sword was undoubtedly an instrument for this purpose, and the apostle mentions its use without any remark of "disapprobation." He enjoins subjection to those who "wear the sword," that is, to those who execute the laws "by that;" and evidently intends to speak of the magistrate "with the sword," or in inflicting capital punishment, as having received the appointment of God. The tendency of society now is "not" to too sanguinary laws. It is rather to forget that God has doomed the murderer to death; and though humanity should be consulted in the execution of the laws, yet there is no humanity in suffering the murderer to live to infest society, and endanger many lives, in the place of his own, which was forfeited to justice. Far better that one murderer should die, than that he should be suffered to live, to imbrue his hands perhaps in the blood of many who are innocent. But the authority of God has settled this question <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5-6</a>, and it is neither right nor safe for a community to disregard his solemn decisions; see "Blackstone's Commentaries," vol. iv. p. 8, (9.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. he beareth not the sword in vain&#8212;that is, the symbol of the magistrate's authority to punish.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For he is the minister of God to thee for good:</span> q.d.

He is a minister of God's appointing and commissioning, that acts under him, and for him, is a kind of a vicegerent of his, and in some, sense represents him; and which is another reason why men ought to be subject to him; and especially since he is appointed for their "good", natural, moral, civil, and spiritual, as Pareus observes: for natural good, for the protection of men's natural lives, which otherwise would be in continual danger from wicked men; for moral good, for the restraining of vice, and encouragement of virtue; profaneness abounds exceedingly, as the case is, but what would it do if there were no laws to forbid it, or civil magistrates to put them in execution? for civil good, for the preservation of men's properties, estates, rights, and liberties, which would be continually invaded, and made a prey of by others; and for spiritual and religious good, as many princes and magistrates have been; a sensible experience of which we have under the present government of these kingdoms, allowing us a liberty to worship God according to our consciences, none making us afraid, and is a reason why we should yield a cheerful subjection to it: <p>but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid: of the punishment of such evil threatened by law, and to be inflicted by the civil magistrate; <p>for he beareth not the sword in vain. The "sword" is an emblem of the power of life and death, the civil magistrate is invested with, and includes all sorts of punishment he has a right to inflict; and this power is not lodged in him in vain; he may and ought to make use of it at proper times, and upon proper persons: <p>for he is the minister of God; as is said before, he has his mission, commission, power and authority from him; and is <p>a revenge to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil; he is a defender of the laws, a vindicator of divine justice, an avenger of the wrongs of men; and his business is to inflict proper punishment, which is meant by wrath, upon delinquents. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he is the minister of God to thee for good. <span class="cverse3">{6}</span> But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> revenger to <i>execute</i> wrath upon him that doeth evil.</span><p>(6) God has armed the magistrate even with an avenging sword.<p>(c) By whom God avenges the wicked.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm" title="For he is the minister of God to you for good.

The <span class="greekheb">σοὶ</span> is not immediately dependent on <span class="greekheb">διάκονός</span>, as if the State were conceived as directly serving the person; the State serves God, with good in view as the end to be secured by its ministry, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the maintenance of the moral order in society; and this situation is one the benefit of which redounds to the individual. <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν δὲ τὸ κακὸν ποιῇς</span>, <span class="greekheb">φοβοῦ</span>: only when the individual does that which is contrary to the end set before the State by God—commits <span class="greekheb">τὸ κακὸν</span>, which frustrates <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἀγαθὸν</span>—need he fear: but then he must fear. <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ εἰκῇ</span>: for not for nothing, but for serious use, does the ruler wear the sword.

But “expressly” is perhaps too much, and Paul could not deliberately vindicate what no one had assailed. He did, indeed, on a memorable occasion (later than this) express his readiness to die if his life had been forfeited to the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-11.htm" title="For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me to them.

When the words <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ γὰρ διάκονός ἐστιν</span> are repeated, it is the punitive ministry of the magistrate which is alone in view. <span class="greekheb">ἔκδικος εἰς ὀργὴν</span>: an avenger for wrath. <span class="greekheb">ὀργὴ</span> in the N.T. almost always (as here) means the wrath of God.
