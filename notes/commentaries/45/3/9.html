It seems upon the whole best to take it as middle for active, which would be apparently unexampled, but is tenable as a question of language, and seems to be compelled by the context. There is no real opposition between the “by no means” of the reply and the “much every way” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm" title="Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.">Romans 3:2</a>.

It also affords an example of the corruptions in the text of the Old Testament to which this practice gave rise. The whole passage as it stands here is found in some manuscripts of the LXX. as part of Psalms 14, whence it has been copied not only into the Vulgate but also our own Prayer Book, which will be seen to differ from the Bible version.<p>The quotations have different degrees of appositeness, so far as they may be considered in the modern sense as probative rather than illustrative. The first, from Psalms 14, is couched in such general terms as to be directly in point; the second and third, from Psalms 5, 140, are aimed specially against the oppressors of the Psalmist; and so, too, the fourth, from Psalms 10, but in a more general and abstract form; that from Isaiah indicates the moral degradation among the prophet’s contemporaries that had led to the Captivity; while the last, from Psalms 36, is an expression applied, not to all men, but particularly to the wicked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they?

This sense of the word is therefore rightly urged by Hemsterhuis, Venema, Koppe, Benecke, Fritzsche (“<span class="ital">utimurne praetextu?</span>”), Krehl, Ewald, Morison; compare also Th. Schott. This explanation is the only one warranted by linguistic usage,[768] as well as suited to the connection (see above). The most usual rendering (adopted by Tholuck, Köllner, de Wette, Rückert, Baumgarten-Crusius, Philippi, Baur, Umbreit, Jatho, and Mangold) is that of the Peschito and Vulgate (<span class="ital">praecellimus eos?</span>), and of Theophylact: <span class="greekheb">ἐχομέν τι πλέον</span>.… <span class="greekheb">καὶ εὐδοκιμοῦμεν οἱ ʼΙουδαῖοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς τόν νόμον καὶ τὴν περιτομὴν δεξάμενοι</span>. Compare Theodoret: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΊ ΟὖΝ ΚΑΤΈΧΟΜΕΝ ΠΕΡΙΣΣΌΝ</span></span></span>; Philippi: “Have we any advantage for ourselves?” and now also Hofmann (who held the right view formerly in his <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. I. p. 501): “Do we raise ourselves above those, upon whom God decrees His judgment of wrath?” But the mere <span class="ital">usus loquendi</span>, affording not a single instance of the <span class="ital">middle</span> employed with the signification <span class="ital">antecellere, raising oneself above, surpassing</span>, or the like, decisively condemns this usual explanation in its different modifications.[769] And would not the answer <span class="greekheb">οὐ πάντως</span>, in whatever sense we take it, so long as agreeably to the context we continue to understand as the subject the <span class="ital">Jewish</span>, not the Christian <span class="ital">we</span> (as Hofmann takes it), be at variance with the answer <span class="greekheb">πολὺ κατὰ πάντα τρόπον</span> given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm" title="Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.">Romans 3:2</a>? The shifts of expositors to escape this inconsistency (the usual one being that Paul here means <span class="ital">subjective</span> advantages in respect of justification, while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-2.htm" title="Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.">Romans 3:2</a> he treats of <span class="ital">objective</span> theocratic advantages) are forced expedients, which, not at all indicated by any clause of more precise definition on the part of Paul himself, only cast suspicion on the explanation. Wetstein, Michaelis, Cramer, Storr, and recently Matthias, take <span class="greekheb">προεχ</span>. as the passive: <span class="ital">are surpassed:</span> “Stand we (at all) at a disadvantage? Are we still surpassed by the Gentiles?” Compare Xen. <span class="ital">Anab.</span> iii. 2, 19; Plut. <span class="ital">Mor.</span> p. 1038 C. But how could this question be logically <span class="ital">inferred</span> from the foregoing without the addition of other thoughts? And in what follows it is not the sinful equality of the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span> with the Jews, but that of the <span class="ital">Jews</span> with the Gentiles which is made conspicuous. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-19.htm" title="Now we know that what things soever the law said, it said to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.">Romans 3:19</a>. Mehring, in thorough opposition to the context, since not a single hint of a transition to the Gentiles is given, makes the question (comp Oecumenius, 2), and that in the sense “Are we at a disadvantage?” be put into the mouth even of a <span class="ital">Gentile</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ πάντως</span>] Vulgate: <span class="ital">nequaquam</span>; Theophylact: <span class="greekheb">οὐδαμῶς</span>. This common rendering (compare the French <span class="ital">point de tout</span>) is, in accordance with the right explanation of <span class="greekheb">προεχόμεθα</span>, the only proper one. The expression, instead of which certainly <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΝΤΩς Οὐ</span></span></span> <span class="ital">might</span> have been used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" title="As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>), is quite analogous to the <span class="greekheb">οὐ πάνυ</span>, where it means <span class="ital">in no wise</span>,[771] as in Xen. <span class="ital">Mem.</span> iii. 1, 11; <span class="ital">Anab.</span> i. 8, 14; Herodian, vi. 5, 11; Dem. <span class="ital">Ol.</span> iii. 21; Plat. <span class="ital">Lach.</span> p. 189 C; Lucian, <span class="ital">Tim.</span> 24 (see Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell</span>. II. p. 87), so that the negative is not transposed, and yet it does not cancel the idea of the adverb, but on the contrary is strengthened by the adverb. By this means the emphatic affirmation, which would have been given by the <span class="greekheb">πάντως</span> alone, is changed into the opposite.[772] Compare Winer, p. 515 f. [E. T. 693]. The comparison with <span class="greekheb">כל</span>—<span class="greekheb">לא</span> (Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut.

For there is nothing in the context to suggest the Gentiles as the speakers, nor does what follow suit the supposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The main question is as to the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, which occurs here only in the New Testament, and has, therefore, to be interpreted from consideration of the sense of which the verb is capable, and the probable drift of the argument. Some have taken it as a passive verb, with the meaning, "Are we surpassed?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are we Jews in <span class="accented">worse</span> case than the Gentiles on account of our greater privileges? The active verb, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of "to excel," being both transitive and intransitive, its passive may be used in the same sense. An instance quoted in commentaries is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (Plut., 'Mor.,'), "cum Jove minores non sint." So the recent Revisers, though dissented from by the American Committee. The strong objection to this interpretation is that there has been nothing so far even to suggest any <span class="accented">superiority</span> of the Gentile to the Jew, and that what follows does not bear upon any such idea. Thus to interpret would be to sacrifice the sense to supposed grammatical exigence, which, after all, is uncertain. Taking, then, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> as the middle voice, we have two interpretations before us; either, with Meyer, to render, <span class="accented">Do we put forward</span> (anything) <span class="accented">in our defence? - which</span> he maintains (though not conclusively) to be the only proper sense of the middle verb - or (as in the Authorized Version), <span class="accented">Are we</span> better (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in better ease) <span class="accented">than they?</span> This rendering, though it gives essentially the same sense as if <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (intransitive) had been written, is commended by its suitableness to the course of argument, and the middle voice may, perhaps, he accounted for as denoting the Jews' supposed claim of superiority for themselves. Thus the connection of thought is plain. The conclusion of ch. 2. had left the Jews on the same footing with the Gentiles before God in respect of sinfulness. But then objections had been raised on the ground of the acknowledged privileges of the chosen people; and such objections have been met. The apostle now sums up the result: What, then, is the state of the case? Have we any advantage to allege? No, not at all in the sense intended; the previous argument stands; and he proceeds to confine his position from the testimony of the Old Testament itself. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Are we better (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;)<p>Rev., are we in worse case than they? Render, with the American Revisers, are we in better case than they, i.e., have we any advantage? The Rev. takes the verb as passive - are we surpassed? which would require the succeeding verses to show that the Gentiles are not better than the Jews; whereas they show that the Jews are not better than the Gentiles. Besides, nothing in the context suggests such a question. Paul has been showing that the Old Testament privileges, though giving to the Jews a certain superiority to the Gentiles, did not give them any advantages in escaping the divine condemnation. After such showing it was natural that the question should be renewed: Do the Jews have any advantage?<p>We have before proved (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;)<p>The reference is not to logical proof, but to forensic accusation. The simple verb means to charge as being the cause (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;) of some evil: hence to accuse, impeach. Rev., correctly, we before laid to the charge. </body></html>
