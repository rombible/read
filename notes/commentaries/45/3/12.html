This is made plain by several passages of Scripture from the Old Testament, which describe the corrupt and depraved state of all men, till grace restrain or change them. Great as our advantages are, these texts describe multitudes who call themselves Christians. Their principles and conduct prove that there is no fear of God before their eyes. And where no fear of God is, no good is to be looked for.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They have all gone out of the way - They have "declined" from the true path of piety and virtue.<p>They are together - They have at the same time; or they have equally become unprofitable.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>; it is said, "they are all gone aside"; as persons in debt: man had a considerable stock of righteousness, holiness, knowledge, &amp;c. but he has run through all, has contracted large and numerous debts, has been obliged to hide himself, has been used as a bankrupt, and turned out of house and home: Christ indeed has undertook to pay, and he has paid all the debts of his people; and has put them into a better state than ever Adam was in: in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/53-3.htm">Psalm 53:3</a>, it is rendered, "everyone of them is gone back"; that is, from God; from his commands, and from their former state and condition: here the phrase is rendered by the apostle, "they are all gone out of the way": that is, out of the way of God and his precepts, out of the way of holiness and righteousness, of light and life; into their own ways, the ways of sin, Satan, and the world of darkness, and of death: so Aben Ezra explains it, "out of the right way"; Kimchi and Ben Melech paraphrase it, "out of the good way: and so" <p>they are together become unprofitable; the word  in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/53-3.htm">Psalm 53:3</a>; is translated, "they are become filthy"; which R. Aben Ezra interprets by  "they are corrupt"; and R. Solomon Jarchi by , "they are turned to corruption"; the metaphor is taken from stinking flesh, which is tainted and corrupted, and so good for nothing, hence here rendered "unprofitable"; for so men being corrupted by sin, are of no use, service, and advantage to God, to men, or to themselves; but, on the contrary, nauseous to God, and to all that are good, and hurtful to themselves and others: for <p>there is none that does good, no, not one; and therefore must be unprofitable. There is none that can do good in a spiritual manner, without the grace of God, strength from Christ, and the assistance of the Spirit; and there is not even a spiritual man, that can do good perfectly, and without sin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-12.htm" title="They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one.">Romans 3:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἠχρεώθησαν</span> is the LXX rendering of <span class="greekheb">נֶאֱלָחוּ</span>, which means “to become sour,” “to turn” (of milk): one and all they have become good for nothing. <span class="greekheb">χρηστότητα</span> usually signifies kindness, and so it is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-6.htm" title="By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm" title="That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.">Ephesians 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-4.htm" title="But after that the kindness and love of God our Savior toward man appeared,">Titus 3:4</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm" title="Or despise you the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-22.htm" title="Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise you also shall be cut off.">Romans 11:22</a> : goodness): here it answers to Hebrew <span class="greekheb">טוֹב</span> and means “good”. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔστιν ἕως ἑνός</span>, <span class="ital">non est usque ad unum</span> (Vulg.), which may be even more exactly given in the Scottish idiom: there is not the length of one.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-12.htm" title="They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one.">Romans 3:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐξέκλιναν</span>, <span class="ital">they have turned aside</span>) they have gone out of the way.
