This is made plain by several passages of Scripture from the Old Testament, which describe the corrupt and depraved state of all men, till grace restrain or change them. Great as our advantages are, these texts describe multitudes who call themselves Christians. Their principles and conduct prove that there is no fear of God before their eyes. And where no fear of God is, no good is to be looked for.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their feet ... - The quotation in this and the two following verses, is abridged or condensed from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7-8</a>. The expressions occur in the midst of a description of the character of the nation in the time of the prophet. The apostle has selected a few expressions out of many, rather making a reference to the entire passage, than a formal quotation. The expression, "their feet are swift," etc., denotes the eagerness of the nation to commit crime, particularly deeds of injustice and cruelty. They thirsted for the blood of innocence, and hasted to shed it, to gratify their malice, or to satisfy their vengeance. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

The sins of the heart and mouth are before described, and now the sins of action are taken notice of; for "the feet" are the instruments of motion and action: and when these are said to be "swift to shed blood", it denotes the readiness and eagerness of men, to murder innocent creatures; which shows the dreadful malice and hatred that is in them. The words are cited from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>, and seem to point at the times of Manasseh, who shed so much innocent blood, as to fill Jerusalem with it from one end to the other. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Their feet are swift to shed blood:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-15.htm" title="Their feet are swift to shed blood:...">Romans 3:15-17</a>.

They describe the moral corruption of Israel in the age of the prophet. According to Lipsius, <span class="greekheb">σύντριμμα καὶ ταλαιπωρία</span> refer to the spiritual misery which comes upon the Jews in the path of self-righteousness. But it is much more natural to suppose that the Apostle is pointing to the destruction and misery which human wickedness inflicts on others, than to any such spiritual results of it. It is as if he had said, “Wherever they go, you can trace them by the ruin and distress they leave behind”. The same consideration applies to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-17.htm" title="And the way of peace have they not known:">Romans 3:17</a>. It does not mean, “They have failed to discover the way of salvation,” but “they tread continually in paths of violence”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-15.htm" title="Their feet are swift to shed blood:...">Romans 3:15-18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὀξεῖς</span>—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔγνωσαν</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/59-7.htm" title="Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are in their paths....">Isaiah 59:7-8</a>, LXX., <span class="greekheb">οἱ δὲ πόδες αὐτῶν</span>—<span class="greekheb">ταχινοὶ ἐκχέαι αἷμα</span>—<span class="greekheb">σύντριμμα οὐκ οἰδασι</span>.
