Their stated ordinances, education in the knowledge of the true God and his service, and many favours shown to the children of Abraham, all were means of grace, and doubtless were made useful to the conversion of many. But especially the Scriptures were committed to them. Enjoyment of God's word and ordinances, is the chief happiness of a people. But God's promises are made only to believers; therefore the unbelief of some, or of many professors, cannot make this faithfulness of no effect. He will fulfil his promises to his people, and bring his threatened vengeance upon unbelievers. God's judging the world, should for ever silence all doubtings and reflections upon his justice. The wickedness and obstinate unbelief of the Jews, proved man's need of the righteousness of God by faith, and also his justice in punishing for sin. Let us do evil, that good may come, is oftener in the heart than in the mouth of sinners; for few thus justify themselves in their wicked ways. The believer knows that duty belongs to him, and events to God; and that he must not commit any sin, or speak one falsehood, upon the hope, or even assurance, that God may thereby glorify himself. If any speak and act thus, their condemnation is just.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if ... - This is an objection similar to the former. It is indeed but another form of the same.<p>The truth of God - His truth or faithfulness in adhering to his threatenings. God threatened to punish the guilty. By their guilt he will take occasion to show his own truth; or their crime will furnish occasion for such an exhibition.<p>Hath more abounded - Has been more striking, or more manifest. His "truth" will be shown by the fulfillment of all his promises to his people, and of all his predictions. But it will also be shown by fulfilling his threatenings on the guilty. It will, therefore, more abound by their condemnation; that is, their condemnation will furnish new and striking instances or his truth. Every lost sinner will be, therefore, an eternal monument of the truth of God.<p>Through my lie - By means of my lie, or as one of the results of my falsehood. The word "lie" here means falsehood, deceitfulness, "unfaithfulness." If by the unfaithfulness of the Jewish people to the covenant, occasion should be given to God to glorify himself, how could they be condemned for it?<p>Unto his glory - To his praise, or so as to show his character in such a way as to excite the praise and admiration of his intelligent creation.<p>Why yet am I ... - How can that act be regarded as evil, which tends to promote the glory of God? The fault in the reasoning of the objector is this, that he takes for granted that the direct tendency of his conduct is to promote God's glory, whereas it is just the reverse; and it is by God's reversing that tendency, or overruling it, that he obtains his glory. The tendency of murder is not to honor the Law, or to promote the security of society, but just the reverse. Still, his execution shall avert the direct tendency of his crime, and do honor to the law and the judge, and promote the peace and security of the community by restraining others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8. For if the truth of God, &c.&#8212;A further illustration of the same sentiment: that is, "Such reasoning amounts to this&#8212;which indeed we who preach salvation by free grace are slanderously accused of teaching&#8212;that the more evil we do, the more glory will redound to God; a damnable principle." (Thus the apostle, instead of refuting this principle, thinks it enough to hold it up to execration, as one that shocks the moral sense).<p>On this brief section, Note (1) Mark the place here assigned to the Scriptures. In answer to the question, "What advantage hath the Jew?" or, "What profit is there of circumcision?" (Ro 3:1) those holding Romish views would undoubtedly have laid the stress upon the priesthood, as the glory of the Jewish economy. But in the apostle's esteem, "the oracles of God" were the jewel of the ancient Church (Ro 3:1, 2). (2) God's eternal purposes and man's free agency, as also the doctrine of salvation by grace and the unchanging obligations of God's law, have ever been subjected to the charge of inconsistency by those who will bow to no truth which their own reason cannot fathom. But amidst all the clouds and darkness which in this present state envelop the divine administration and many of the truths of the Bible, such broad and deep principles as are here laid down, and which shine in their own luster, will be found the sheet-anchor of our faith. "Let God be true, and every man a liar" (Ro 3:4); and as many advocates of salvation by grace as say, "Let us do evil that good may come," "their damnation is just" (Ro 3:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="bld">truth</span> he means the faithfulness and veracity of God; as by <span class="ital">lie, </span> the perfidiousness and inconstancy of man; <span class="ital">ut supra et alibi.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</span> q.d. If more glory accrues to the name of God by my wickedness, what reason is there that I should be punished, and proceeded against as an offender, who have occasioned this further glory to God? The apostle doth plainly personate in this place a wicked objector, or he speaks in the name and person of such a one. This way of speaking and writing is very frequent among all authors; and it is found sometimes with the penmen of the Holy Scriptures: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm" title="For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even one thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; yes, they have all one breath; so that a man has no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity....">Ecclesiastes 3:19-22</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm" title="If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantages it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.">1 Corinthians 15:32</a></span>.

The "truth of God" is the same with "the righteousness of God", <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>, and means his faithfulness; of which it is hypothetically said, it <p>hath more abounded; or has been more illustrated, <p>through my lie to his glory: nothing is more opposite to truth than a lie; a lie of itself can never be of any advantage to truth, or to the God of truth; nothing is more contrary to the nature of God, and more abominable to him; a lie is of the devil, and punishable with eternal death; wherefore it may seem strange, that the truth of God should abound through it to his glory: now let it be observed, that the apostle is not speaking of himself, nor of his lie of unbelief, in his state of unregeneracy; but in the person of a sinful man, "for every man is a liar", <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>, as he says, "I speak as a man", <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5</a>; representing a wicked man, who from what was before said, might collect this as the sense of it, that the truth of God is illustrated by the lies of men: and so much may be owned as the apostle's sense, that the truth of God is commended, illustrated, and made to abound, when it is asserted, that he is true and faithful, and every man is a liar, fallacious, and deceitful; "let God be true, and every man a liar", <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>, moreover, the truth of God may be allowed to abound through the lies of men, in a comparative sense, the one being set against the other; and so as contraries do, illustrate each other: this may be assented to, as that sometimes a lie has been overruled by God, for the accomplishing of his purposes and promises, in which his truth and faithfulness have been displayed, as in the cases of Jacob and the Egyptian midwives; but then this does not arise from its nature and tendency, but from the overruling wisdom and providence of God, and therefore not to be excused hereby from sin; and consequently the inference from it is not just, that therefore "no man can, or ought to be, judged as a sinner"; since his sin turns to such account, as to make for the glory of God, which is intimated in the question: <p>why yet am I also judged as a sinner? if this be the case, I ought not to be reckoned a sinner, or to be treated as such here, or judged and condemned as one hereafter, which is a most wicked, as well as weak consequence; for though God is true and faithful to his promises, notwithstanding the sins of his people, which are as a foil, to set off the lustre of his truth the more, yet their sins are nevertheless sins, and are taken notice of by him as such, and they are corrected for them; and however God may overrule, in a providential way, the sins of others for his glory, this is no excuse for their sins, nor will it be an exemption of them from punishment. This is the sense of the passage; unless by "the truth of God" should be meant, the Gospel, the word of truth, which is of God; and which through the apostle's "lie", as the Jews might call his ministration of it, "abounded to" the "glory" of God; being spread far and near, and made useful for the conversion of sinners, for turning men from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; and for the planting of churches in the Gentile world, as well as in Judea; which much conduced to the honour of God, and the interest of true religion: and then the meaning of the last clause is, "why yet am I also judged as a sinner?" why am I accounted and condemned as an heretic? as an apostate from the faith? as he was by the Jews, and who are used to call heretics sinners: so "the sinner" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a> is thus interpreted (p),  "these are the heretics": and elsewhere it (q) is observed, that concerning the heretics it is said, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>, "the name of the wicked shall rot": and I very much suspect this to be the sense of the word in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-24.htm">John 9:24</a>, "we know that this man is a sinner"; an heretic, a man of bad principles; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-31.htm">John 9:31</a>; "now we know that God heareth not sinners"; men of corrupt minds; since this character stands opposed to a worshipper of the God of Israel. <p>(p) Midrash Kohelet, fol. 77. 1.((q) Juchasin, fol. 130. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> For if the <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</span><p>(3) A third objection, which adds somewhat to the former: if sins turn out to the glory of God, they are not only not to be punished, but we ought rather to give ourselves to them: and this blasphemy Paul, as he fights to curse and detest it, pronounces it to be a just punishment against such blasphemers.<p>(i) The truth and unchangingness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-7.htm" title="For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?">Romans 3:7</a> f.

(See this, as early as Chrysostom.) Another view is that of Calvin, Beza, Grotius, Wolf, and many others, including Rückert, Kollner, Tholuck, Philippi and Umbreit, that the objection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?

So in substance (“<span class="ital">just I</span>” according to Hermann, <span class="ital">a</span>[757]<span class="ital"> Viger.</span> p. 837) also Tholuck and Morison; compare Philippi: “<span class="ital">even I still</span>.” There lies in the expression something of boldness and defiance; but it is not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτός</span>, or <span class="greekheb">αὐτός ἐγώ</span>, to the meaning of which Th. Schott and Hofmann ultimately bring it (“<span class="ital">even personally still</span>”). We may add that this first person, individualising just like the preceding one (<span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐμῷ ψ</span>.), of course represents <span class="ital">the sinner in general</span> (with an intended application to the <span class="ital">Jews</span>, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?

Accordingly, as <span class="greekheb">καί</span> continues the question, only a comma is to be placed after <span class="greekheb">κρίνομαι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As regards the construction, Paul has dropped the plan of the sentence begun with <span class="greekheb">καὶ μή</span> (<span class="ital">and why should we not do evil</span>, etc.), being led away from it by the inserted remark, and has joined <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ποιήσωμεν</span> <span class="ital">in direct address</span> (<span class="ital">let us do</span>) to the <span class="greekheb">λέγειν</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is <span class="ital">recitative</span>. But on account of this very blending there is no necessity either to make a parenthesis or to supply anything. For similar attractions (compare especially Xen. <span class="ital">Anab.</span> vi. 4, 18) in which the discourse is interrupted by an intervening clause, and then continued in a regimen dependent on the latter and no longer suitable to the beginning, see Hermann <span class="ital">a</span>[758]<span class="ital"> Viger.</span> p. 745, 894; Bernhardy, p. 464; Dissen, <span class="ital">a</span>[759]<span class="ital"> Dem. de cor.</span> p. 346, 418; Krüger, <span class="ital">gramm. Unters.</span> p. 457 ff. Many erroneous attempts have been made by commentators (see the various explanations in Morison) to bring out an unbroken construction, as <span class="ital">e.g.</span> the supplying of <span class="greekheb">ἐροῦμεν</span> or some such word after <span class="greekheb">μή</span> (Erasmus, Calvin, Wolf, Koppe, Benecke, and others, also van Hengel). Even the expedient of Matthias is untenable.[760] The same may be said of that of Hofmann, who supplies an <span class="greekheb">ἐστίν</span> after <span class="greekheb">καὶ μή</span>, and renders: “<span class="ital">Why does it not happen to me according to that, as</span> (<span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>) <span class="ital">we are slandered</span>,” etc. But if it is quite gratuitous to supply <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span>, it is still more so to make this <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> equivalent to <span class="greekheb">γίνεται μοι</span>.

What may have occasioned such slanders against the Christians? Certainly their non-observance of the Mosaic law, to which they ventured to deem themselves not bound, in order to gain eternal life by the grace of God through faith in the redemptive work of Christ, which was an offence to the Jews. The plural is not to be referred to <span class="ital">Paul alone</span>, which would be arbitrary on account of the preceding singular; the Christians are conceived as <span class="ital">Pauline</span> (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21</a>); and on the part of Jews and Judaizers (<span class="greekheb">τινές</span>, <span class="ital">certain people</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?">1 Corinthians 15:12</a>) are slanderously and falsely (for see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound.

Under this <span class="ital">general category</span>, namely, the calumniators reduced the bearing of the Christians, so far as the latter, without regulating their conduct by the Mosaic law, were nevertheless assured, and professed, that they should through faith in Christ obtain the divine blessings of salvation. That general accusation was an injurious abstract inference thence deduced.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὧν</span>] <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of those, who follow this principle destructive of the whole moral order of God.

The reference of <span class="greekheb">ὧν</span> to the <span class="ital">slanderers</span> (Theodoret, Grotius, Tholuck, Mehring, Hofmann) is unsuitable, because it separates the weighty closing sentence from the argumentation itself, and makes it merely an accessory thought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ κρῖμα</span>] The definite judicial sentence, decree of punishment at the last judgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΝΔΙΚΟΝ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">accordant with justice</span>, rightful.

With this artificial interpretation, we must remember that Paul would have written <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐ</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">καὶ μή</span>, since it is an objective relation that is here in question (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a> <span class="ital">al.</span>); that instead of <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span> we should have expected the repetition of the <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>; and that the notion of <span class="greekheb">κρίνειν</span>, as it prevails in the connection (compare also the following <span class="greekheb">τὸ κρῖμα</span>), does not suit the assumed thought, <span class="greekheb">ὡς ποιήσας τὰ ἀγαθά</span>.

These verses are extremely difficult, and are interpreted variously according to the force assigned to the <span class="greekheb">τί ἔτι κἀγὼ</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-7.htm" title="For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?">Romans 3:7</a>. Who or what supplies the contrast to this emphatic “I also”? Some commentators, Gifford, for instance, find it in God, and God’s interest in the judgment. If my lie sets in relief the truth of God, and so magnifies His glory, is not that enough? Why, after God has had this satisfaction from my sin, “why further am <span class="ital">I</span> also on my side brought to judgment as a sinner?” It is a serious, if not a final objection to this, that it merely repeats the argument of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)">Romans 3:5</a>, which the Apostle has already refuted. Its very generality, too—for any man, as Gifford himself says, may thus protest against being judged,—lessens its relevance: for Paul is discussing not human evasions of God’s judgment, but Jewish objections to his previous arguments. Lipsius finds the contrast to <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ</span> in the Gentile world. A Jew is the speaker, or at all events the Apostle speaks in the character of one: “if my unbelief does magnify His faithfulness, is not that all that is required? Why am I, too, like the rest of the world, whose relation to God is so different, and whose judgment is so necessary, still brought into judgment?” This would be legitimate enough, probably, if it were not for what follows. But the slander of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-8.htm" title="And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.">Romans 3:8</a>, which forms part of the same question as <span class="greekheb">τί ἔτι κἀγὼ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and to which reference is made again in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-15.htm" title="What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.">Romans 6:15</a>, had not the Jews, but the Apostle in his Christian character, for its object; hence it seems preferable to take the <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ</span> as referring strictly to himself. That <span class="ital">Paul</span> would come into judgment, in spite of the fact that <span class="ital">his</span> faithlessness in becoming a Christian had only set off the faithfulness of God to Israel, no unbelieving Jew questioned: and Paul turns this conviction of theirs (with which, of course, he agrees, so far as it asserts that he will be judged) against themselves. If he, for his part, cannot evade judgment, on the ground that his sin (as they think it) has been a foil to God’s righteousness, no more can they on their part: they and he are in one position, and must be judged together: to condemn him is to expose themselves to condemnation; that is his point. The argument of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-7.htm" title="For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?">Romans 3:7</a> is both an <span class="ital">argumentum ad hominem</span> and an <span class="ital">argumentum ad rem:</span> Paul borrows from his opponents the premises that he himself is to be judged as a sinner, and that his lie has set off God’s truth: there is enough in these premises to serve his purpose, which is to show that these two propositions which do not exclude each other in his case do not do so in their case either. But, of course, he would interpret the second in a very different way from them. The question is continued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-8.htm" title="And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.">Romans 3:8</a>, though the construction is changed by the introduction of the parentheses with <span class="greekheb">καθὼς</span> and the attachment to <span class="greekheb">λέγειν ὅτι</span> of the clause which would naturally have gone with <span class="greekheb">τί μή</span>; If judgment could be evaded by sinning to the glory of God, so Paul argues, he and other Christians like him might naturally act on the principle which slander imputed to them—that of doing evil that good might come. No doubt the slander was of Jewish origin. The doctrine that righteousness is a gift of God, not to be won by works of law, but by faith in Jesus Christ, can always be misrepresented as immoral: “sin the more, it will only the more magnify grace” Paul does not stoop to discuss it. The judgment that comes on those who by such perversions of reason and conscience seek to evade all judgment is just.
