That boasting is excluded is much rather the consequence than the cause of the principle that man is justified by faith. This principle the Apostle regards as sufficiently proved by his previous argument.<p><span class= "bld">We conclude.</span>—This conveys too much the idea of an inference; the statement is rather made in the form of an assertion, “we consider,” or “we hold.” “For we hold that a man (any human being—whether Jew or Greek) is justified by faith, independently of any works prescribed by law.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-28.htm" title="Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.">Romans 3:28</a></span>. <span class="ital">Therefore we conclude </span>— As if he had said, Since it appears, by what has been said, that all are sinners, involved in guilt and condemnation, and so cannot be justified by the law, whether natural or revealed, and that God has appointed another way of justification, we draw this conclusion; <span class="ital">that a man is justified </span>— Is accounted righteous, accepted and dealt with as such; <span class="ital">by faith </span>— By believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the mercy and grace of God, and the truths and promises of the gospel through him.

It may be proper to observe here, 1st, That the faith by which men, under the new covenant, are justified, “hath for its object <span class="ital">persons, </span>rather than <span class="ital">propositions. </span>So Christ himself hath told us; <span class="ital">Ye believe in God, believe also in me. </span>So Moses also; <span class="ital">Abraham believed in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteousness: </span>and Paul; <span class="ital">Believe in the Lord Jesus</span> <span class="ital">Christ, and thou shalt be saved. </span>In the mean time, this faith in God and in Christ necessarily leads those who possess it, to believe every thing made known to them by God and by Christ, and to do every thing which they have enjoined: so that it terminates in the sincere belief of the doctrines of religion, and in the constant practice of its duties, as far as they are made known to the believer.” 2d, “When the apostle tells us, that <span class="ital">by faith man is justified without the works of the law, </span>or rather, <span class="ital">works of law, </span>his plain meaning is, that men are justified <span class="ital">gratuitously </span>by faith, and not <span class="ital">meritoriously </span>by perfect obedience to any law whatever.” See note on chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a>.

Now, if we were saved by our own works, boasting would not be excluded. But the way of justification by faith for ever shuts out boasting. Yet believers are not left to be lawless; faith is a law, it is a working grace, wherever it is in truth. By faith, not in this matter an act of obedience, or a good work, but forming the relation between Christ and the sinner, which renders it proper that the believer should be pardoned and justified for the sake of the Saviour, and that the unbeliever who is not thus united or related to him, should remain under condemnation. The law is still of use to convince us of what is past, and to direct us for the future. Though we cannot be saved by it as a covenant, yet we own and submit to it, as a rule in the hand of the Mediator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - As the result of the previous train of argument.<p>That a man - That all who are justified; that is, that there is no other way.<p>Is justified by faith - Is regarded and treated as righteous, by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ.<p>Without the deeds of the law - Without works as a meritorious ground of justification. The apostle, of course, does not mean that Christianity does not produce good works, or that they who are justified will not obey the Law, and be holy; but that no righteousness of their own will be the ground of their justification. They are sinners; and as such can have no claim to he treated as righteous. God has devised a plan by which, they may be pardoned and saved; and that is by faith alone. This is the grand uniqueness of the Christian religion. This was the special point in the reformation from popery. Luther often called this doctrine of justification by faith the article upon which the church stood or fell - articulus stantis, vel cadentis ecclesiae - and it is so. If this doctrine is held entire, all others will be held with it. If this is abandoned, all others will fall also. It may be remarked here, however, that this doctrine by no means interferes with the doctrine that good works are to be performed by Christians. Paul urges this as much as any other writer in the New Testament. His doctrine is, that they are not to be relied on as a ground of justification; but that he did not mean to teach that they are not to be performed by Christians is apparent from the connection, and from the following places in his epistles: <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-10.htm">1 Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm">1 Timothy 5:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-25.htm">1 Timothy 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-18.htm">1 Timothy 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm">2 Timothy 3:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24</a>.

Therefore we conclude, &c.&#8212;It is the unavoidable tendency of dependence upon our own works, less or more, for acceptance with God, to beget a spirit of "boasting."

This is the conclusion from the premises, the sum total of the whole account: <p>that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. The subject of justification is, "man", not in opposition to angels; nor does it design the Jew against the Gentile, though some have so thought; but the apostle names neither Jew nor Gentile, but "man", to show that Christ's righteousness is unto all, and every man, that believes, be he who he will; and is to be understood indefinitely, that every man that is justified is justified by faith. The means is "by faith", not habitually or actually considered; that is, either as an habit and principle infused into us, or as an act performed by us; but either organically, as it is a means of receiving Christ's righteousness; or objectively, as it denotes Christ the object of it: and all this is done "without works", of any sort; not by a faith which is without works, for such a faith is dead, and of no avail; but by faith without works joined to it, in the affair of justification; or by the righteousness of Christ imputed by God the Father, without any consideration of them, and received by faith, and relied upon by the believer, without any regard unto them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-28.htm" title="Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.">Romans 3:28</a> gives the ground of the <span class="greekheb">οὐχί κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[919]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΟΓΙΖΌΜΕΘΑ</span></span></span>] <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἘΠῚ ἈΜΦΙΒΟΛΊΑς ΛΈΓΕΤΑΙ</span></span></span> (Theodore of Mopsuestia): <span class="ital">censemus</span>, we <span class="ital">deem</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-3.htm" title="And think you this, O man, that judge them which do such things, and do the same, that you shall escape the judgment of God?">Romans 2:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm" title="For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.">Romans 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-5.htm" title="For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very most chief apostles.">2 Corinthians 11:5</a>.
