Or we may take the first two words by themselves, and throw the next two clauses together. How stands the case? If some rejected the faith, shall their rejection make void or defeat the faithfulness of God?<p>The Apostle considers an objection that might be brought against his argument that the divine revelation vouchsafed to them was a special privilege of the Jewish people. It might be said that they had forfeited and cancelled this privilege by their unbelief. He first reduces the objection to its proper limits; it was not <span class= "ital">all,</span> but <span class= "ital">some,</span> who were unbelievers. But granting that there were some who did not believe this fact would have no power to shake the eternal promises of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-3.htm" title="For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?...">Romans 3:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">For what if some </span>— And they a considerable number, of those who once possessed these invaluable treasures; <span class="ital">did not believe </span>— Them, or did not duly consider what they speculatively believed, and so rejected the gospel to which they were intended to lead; <span class="ital">shall their unbelief make without effect </span>— Shall it disannul; <span class="ital">the faith of God </span>— His faithful promises made to Abraham and his seed, especially of sending the Messiah, and of effecting our redemption by him? Shall it destroy his fidelity to his promises, and prevent his fulfilling them to them that do believe? God, having promised to give to Abraham and his seed the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and to be their God, the Jews affirmed that if they were cast off from being his people, and driven out of Canaan for not believing on Jesus, the faithfulness of God in performing his promises would be destroyed. Probably the apostles, in their discourses to the Jews, had, if not expressly affirmed, yet obscurely intimated, that for crucifying Jesus they would be punished in that manner. <span class="ital">God forbid </span>— That we should insinuate any thing that can be justly considered as derogatory to God’s faithfulness: <span class="ital">yea, let God be true — </span>Let the blessed God be acknowledged true to his covenant and his promises, though <span class="ital">every man </span>should be esteemed <span class="ital">a liar, </span>and unfit to have any confidence reposed in him; or, though every Jew should disbelieve, and be cast off on that account. To understand this more fully, we must recollect, that the performance of the promises to the natural seed of Abraham, is, in the original covenant, tacitly made to depend on their faith and obedience, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-19.htm" title="For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.">Genesis 18:19</a>, and that it is explicitly made to depend on that condition in the renewal of the covenant, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/28-1.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to the voice of the LORD your God, to observe and to do all his commandments which I command you this day, that the LORD your God will set you on high above all nations of the earth:...">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>. Besides, on that occasion, God expressly threatened to expel the natural seed from Canaan, and scatter them among the heathen, if they became unbelieving and disobedient, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm" title="And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.">Leviticus 26:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-64.htm" title="And the LORD shall scatter you among all people, from the one end of the earth even to the other; and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known, even wood and stone.">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>. The rejection, therefore, and expulsion of the Jews from Canaan, for their unbelief, being a fulfilling of the threatenings of the covenant, established the faithfulness of God, instead of destroying it. <span class="ital">As it is written, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-4.htm" title="Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight: that you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge.">Psalm 51:4</a>, <span class="ital">That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings </span>— <span class="greekheb">Εν τοις λογοις σου </span><span class="ital">in thy words; and mightest overcome </span>— Be pronounced holy and just, and clear of all imputation of unrighteousness; <span class="ital">when thou art judged </span>— When any presume insolently to arraign the equity of thy conduct, or, when thy proceedings are narrowly examined by right reason. The original expression, however, <span class="greekheb">εν τω κρινεσθαι σε</span>, it seems, should rather be rendered, <span class="ital">when thou judgest, </span>a translation agreeable to the place whence the quotation is made. God’s <span class="ital">words </span>referred to, in which David justified God, or acknowledged him to be just, are those threatenings which Nathan, by God’s order, denounced against him, on account of his crimes of adultery and murder, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/12-9.htm" title="Why have you despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? you have killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon....">2 Samuel 12:9-12</a>. And God judged, or punished David, when he executed these threatenings on him and his posterity; and David acknowledged God to be just, or clear, in doing this, by receiving the deserved punishment in humility, resignation, and meekness. And the apostle seems to have quoted David’s confession, that God’s punishing him in the manner threatened by Nathan, was no breach of the promises he had made to him and his posterity, because it showed the Jews that God’s promises, like his threatenings, were all conditional, and that, consistently with his promises to Abraham and to his seed, God might reject the Israelites, and drive them out of Canaan, they having forfeited their right to be accounted the seed of Abraham, the father of the faithful, by their infidelity; and the Gentiles, by imitating his faith, being now received for God’s children.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 The law could not save in or from sins, yet it gave the Jews advantages for obtaining salvation. Their stated ordinances, education in the knowledge of the true God and his service, and many favours shown to the children of Abraham, all were means of grace, and doubtless were made useful to the conversion of many. But especially the Scriptures were committed to them. Enjoyment of God's word and ordinances, is the chief happiness of a people. But God's promises are made only to believers; therefore the unbelief of some, or of many professors, cannot make this faithfulness of no effect. He will fulfil his promises to his people, and bring his threatened vengeance upon unbelievers. God's judging the world, should for ever silence all doubtings and reflections upon his justice. The wickedness and obstinate unbelief of the Jews, proved man's need of the righteousness of God by faith, and also his justice in punishing for sin. Let us do evil, that good may come, is oftener in the heart than in the mouth of sinners; for few thus justify themselves in their wicked ways. The believer knows that duty belongs to him, and events to God; and that he must not commit any sin, or speak one falsehood, upon the hope, or even assurance, that God may thereby glorify himself. If any speak and act thus, their condemnation is just.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For what if some did not believe? - This is to be regarded as another objection of a Jew. "What then? or what follows? if it be admitted that some of the nation did not believe, does it not follow that the faithfulness of God in his promises will fail?" The points of the objection are these:<p>(1) The apostle had maintained that the nation was sinful <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2.htm">Romans 2</a>; that is, that they had not obeyed or believed God.<p>(2) This, the objector for the time admits or supposes in relation to some of them. But,<p>(3) he asks whether this does not involve a consequence which is not admissible, that God is unfaithful.<p>Did not the fact that God chose them as his people, and entered into covenant with them, imply that the Jews should be kept from perdition? It was evidently their belief that all Jews would be saved, and this belief they grounded on his covenant with their fathers. The doctrine of the apostle <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2.htm">Romans 2</a> would seem to imply that in certain respects they were on a level with the Gentile nations; that if they sinned, they would be treated just like the pagan; and hence, they asked of what value was the promise of God? Had it not become vain and nugatory?<p>Make the faith - The word "faith" here evidently means the "faithfulness" or "fidelity of God to his promises." Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a>.<p>Of none effect - Destroy it; or prevent him from fulfilling his promises. The meaning of the objection is, that the fact supposed, that the Jews would become unfaithful and be lost, would imply that God had failed to keep his promises to the nation; or that he had made promises which the result showed he was not able to perform. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4. For what if some did not believe?&#8212;It is the unbelief of the great body of the nation which the apostle points at; but as it sufficed for his argument to put the supposition thus gently, he uses this word "some" to soften prejudice.<p>shall their unbelief make the faith of God&#8212;or, "faithfulness of God."<p>of none effect?&#8212;"nullify," "invalidate" it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If some did not believe; </span> if some did remain in infidelity, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-24.htm" title="And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.">Acts 28:24</a></span>, if they would give no credit to the oracle, and to the promise of a Messiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The faith of God; </span> i.e. the truth and faithfulness of God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-4.htm" title="For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.">Psalm 33:4</a></span>. The whole verse is another prolepsis. The implied objection is this, That the Jews are nothing the better for these oracles, or have no advantage by them, if by unbelief they have rendered themselves unworthy or incapable of benefit by them. The answer to this is anticipated by propounding another question; Can the infidelity of some be any hinderance of God’s performing his promise to others, to his chosen ones? The interrogation is a negation, q.d. It cannot be, as the following words show: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-13.htm" title="If we believe not, yet he stays faithful: he cannot deny himself.">2 Timothy 2:13</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For what if some did not believe?.... It is suggested, that though the Jews enjoyed such a privilege, some of them did not believe; which is an aggravation of their sin, that they should have such means of light, knowledge, and faith, such clear and full evidences of things, and yet be incredulous: though it should be observed that this was the case only of some, not of all; and must be understood, not of their disbelief of the Scriptures being the word of God, for these were always received as such by them all, and were constantly read, heard, and attended to; but either of their disobedience to the commands of God required in the law, or of their disregard to the promises of God, and prophecies of the Messiah, and of their disbelief in the Messiah himself when he came; but now this was no objection to the advantage they had of the Gentiles, since this was not owing to want of evidence in the word of God, but to the darkness and unbelief of their minds: and, <p>shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? no, their unbelief could not, and did not make void the veracity and faithfulness of God in his promises concerning the Messiah, recorded in the oracles of God, which they had committed to them; for notwithstanding this, God raised up the Messiah from among them, which is another advantage the Jews had of, the Gentiles; inasmuch as "of" them, "as concerning the flesh, Christ came, who is God over all, blessed for evermore", <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>, and he sent him to them, to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, as a prophet and minister; he sent his Gospel to them first, and called out by it from among them his elect, nor did he take it from them until he had done this: and he took it away only; until "the fulness of the Gentiles", <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>, is brought in; and then the Gospel shall come to them again with power, and "all Israel shall be saved" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For what if some did not <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> believe? shall their unbelief make the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> faith of God without effect?</span><p>(c) Break the covenant.<p>(d) The faith that God gave.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-3.htm" title="For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?">Romans 3:3</a>.

The <span class="greekheb">ἠπίστησαν</span> and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΙΣΤΊΑ</span></span></span> are by the context necessarily referred to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΌΓΙΑ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΕΟῦ</span>;<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> the unbelief of a part of the Jews in the promises manifested itself, namely, by their rejecting the Messiah who had appeared according to the promise. So in substance also Matthias, who nevertheless apprehends the notion of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΙΣΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> as <span class="ital">unfaithfulness</span> towards what was entrusted to them, which the <span class="greekheb">τίνες</span> did not use for the purpose of letting themselves be led thereby to Christ.

T. (see in this Epistle <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-20.htm" title="He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;">Romans 4:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm" title="Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith.

This remark also applies against the supposition of Köllner, de Wette, Mehring, and older writers, that Paul meant the <span class="ital">unfaithfulness</span> (the <span class="ital">disobedience</span>) of the Jews <span class="ital">in the times before Christ</span>.[739] Such a view is opposed to the context; and must not the idea, that the earlier breaches of covenant on the part of the Jews might possibly annul the <span class="greekheb">λόγια</span>, have been wholly strange to Paul and his Jewish readers, since they knew from experience that, even when the Jews had heaped unfaithfulness upon unfaithfulness, God always committed to them anew, through His prophets, the promises of the Messiah? In the mind of the Apostle the idea of the <span class="greekheb">πάρεσις τῶν προγεγονότων ἁμαρτημάτων</span> was fixed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm" title="And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:">Acts 17:30</a>). Therefore we cannot understand (with Philippi) unbelief in the promises shown in the period <span class="ital">before Christ</span> to be here referred to. But according to the doctrine of faith in the promised One who had come, as the condition of the Messianic salvation, the doubt might very easily arise: May not the partial <span class="ital">unbelief</span> of the Jews <span class="ital">since the appearance of Christ</span>, to whom the <span class="greekheb">λόγια</span> referred, possibly cancel the divine utterances of promise committed to the nation? Notwithstanding the simple and definite conception of <span class="greekheb">ἀπιστεῖν</span> throughout the N. T., Hofmann here multiplies the ideas embraced so as to include as well disobedience to the law as unbelief towards the Gospel and unbelief towards the prophetic word of promise—a grouping together of very different significations, which is the consequence of the erroneous and far too wide sense assigned to the <span class="greekheb">λόγια τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν πίστιν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>] The genitive is necessarily determined to be the genitive of the subject, partly by <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀπιστία αὐτῶν</span>, partly by <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm" title="God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.">Romans 3:4</a>, and partly by <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ δικαιοσ</span>. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?

What is in Paul’s mind is that “the oracles of God” have had their fulfilment in Christ, and that those to whom they were entrusted have in some cases (whether few or many he does not here consider) refused their faith to that fulfilment. Surely it is no proper inference that their unbelief must make God’s faithfulness of no effect. <span class="ital">He</span> has kept His promise, and as far as it lay with Him has maintained the original advantage of the Jews, as depositaries and first inheritors of that promise, whatever reception they may have given to its fulfilment. Away with the thought of any reflection upon Him! When the case is stated between God and man there can only be one conclusion: let God come out (<span class="greekheb">γινέσθω</span>) true, and every man a liar; let Him be just, and every man condemned. This agrees with the words of Scripture itself in Psalms 51 (50):6, which Paul quotes exactly after the LXX: the Hebrew is distinctly different, but neither it nor the original context are regarded. <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς λόγοις σου</span> is a translation of Hebrew words which mean “when Thou speakest,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, apparently, when Thou pronouncest sentence upon man; here the sense must be, “that Thou mayest be pronounced just in respect of what Thou hast spoken,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the <span class="greekheb">λόγια</span>, the oracles or promises entrusted to Israel, <span class="greekheb">νικήσεις</span>: win thy case (see note on text).

The difficulty results partly from a doubt as to where the Opponent speaks, and partly from the Apostle’s own thought modifying the words put into the Opponent’s mouth.

But the meaning of words must not be forced to meet the views of interpreters; and we observe that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> are ever elsewhere used in their proper sense to denote want of <span class="accented">faith</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-11.htm">Mark 16:11, 14, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>, 41; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-24.htm">Acts 27:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-20.htm">Romans 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-13.htm">2 Timothy 2:13</a>). Still, it is to be observed that in the passage before us <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in man is opposed to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in God, so as to suggest a more general sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> than mere <span class="accented">unbelief.</span> In view of this opposition, we may adopt the rendering of the whole passage in the Revised Version: "What if some were without faith? Shall their want of faith," etc.? Meyer and others, understanding (as said above) by <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> the Divine oracles which were prophetic of Christ, refer <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> exclusively to the disbelief in him on the part of the majority of the Jews at the time of writing. But the aorist tense of the verb, as well as the context, is against the idea of such reference, at any rate exclusively. The context, both in ch. 2. and the latter part of this chapter after ver. 9, certainly suggests rather reference to the failure of the Jews throughout their history to realize the advantage of their privileged position; and this failure might properly be attributed to their want of faith, to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>), cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm">Hebrews 4:2</a>, together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in these passages is regarded as the root of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. On the other hand, the whole drift of ch. 11. in this Epistle - where the <span class="accented">present</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the chosen people shown in their rejection of the gospel is spoken of as not hindering, but furthering, the righteous purpose of God, and redounding in the end to his glory - suggests a like reference here. And it may have been in the apostle's mind, though, for the reasons above given, it can hardly be the only one in the passage before us. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Did not believe (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., were without faith. Not, as some, were unfaithful, which is contrary to New Testament usage.

The word occurs twenty-five times in Paul, and is variously rendered in A.V. make void, destroy, loose, bring to nought, fail, vanish away, put away, put down, abolish, cease. The radical meaning is to make inert or idle. Dr. Morison acutely observes that it negatives the idea of agency or operation, rather than of result or effect. It is rather to make inefficient than to make without effect.
