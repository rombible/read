But this does not abrogate God’s original choice of them. They are still His beloved people, for the sake of their forefathers, the patriarchs, if not for their own.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-28.htm" title="As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes....">Romans 11:28-29</a></span>. <span class="ital">As concerning the gospel </span>— That is, in reference to the gospel; <span class="ital">they are enemies for your sakes </span>— They reject it with the greater hatred, because you embrace it, or rather, (for they generally rejected the gospel before the Gentiles were called,) they reject the gospel, and thereby show that they are enemies to it, to God, and to themselves, which God permits <span class="ital">for your sakes, </span>and which turns to your advantage: (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm" title="I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?

Or, <span class="ital">the election </span>here spoken of may be that national election, whereby the Jews were made the church and people of God. See on chap, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-11.htm" title="(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls;)">Romans 9:11</a>. In respect of that election, the Jews, though unbelieving, and enemies in respect of the gospel, as is said in the former clause, are still beloved with a love of compassion and goodwill, for the special love God bore to Abraham and the rest of the patriarchs, from whom they are descended: and, in consequence of the promises made to their fathers, they shall, as a people, in some future period, become the people of God, by believing the gospel. It is justly observed by Whitby, that there is a two-fold election of the Jews spoken of in this chapter; one whereby they were made the people of God, through their natural descent from the fathers, and which Moses has described, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth....">Deuteronomy 7:6-8</a>. The other, whereby such of them as believed on Christ, were made the people of God under the gospel dispensation. This election is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm" title="What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.">Romans 11:7</a>. <span class="ital">For the gifts and calling of God, </span>&c. — “The blessings which God freely bestowed on Abraham and his seed, and his <span class="ital">calling, </span>or making them his people, God will never repent of; but will restore to his natural seed the honour of being his people, after the Redeemer hath turned away their ungodliness of unbelief, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/16-60.htm" title="Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant....">Ezekiel 16:60-62</a>.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:22-32 Of all judgments, spiritual judgments are the sorest; of these the apostle is here speaking. The restoration of the Jews is, in the course of things, far less improbable than the call of the Gentiles to be the children of Abraham; and though others now possess these privileges, it will not hinder their being admitted again. By rejecting the gospel, and by their indignation at its being preached to the Gentiles, the Jews were become enemies to God; yet they are still to be favoured for the sake of their pious fathers. Though at present they are enemies to the gospel, for their hatred to the Gentiles; yet, when God's time is come, that will no longer exist, and God's love to their fathers will be remembered. True grace seeks not to confine God's favour. Those who find mercy themselves, should endeavour that through their mercy others also may obtain mercy. Not that the Jews will be restored to have their priesthood, and temple, and ceremonies again; an end is put to all these; but they are to be brought to believe in Christ, the true become one sheep-fold with the Gentiles, under Christ the Great Shepherd. The captivities of Israel, their dispersion, and their being shut out from the church, are emblems of the believer's corrections for doing wrong; and the continued care of the Lord towards that people, and the final mercy and blessed restoration intended for them, show the patience and love of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As concerning the gospel - So far as the gospel is concerned; or, in order to promote its extension and spread through the earth.<p>They are enemies - The word "enemies" here stands opposed to "beloved;" and as in one respect, to wit, on account of "election," they were still beloved, that is, beloved by God, so in another respect they were his enemies, i. e., opposed to him, or cast off from him. The enemies of God denote all who are not his true friends; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-8.htm">Romans 11:8</a>. The word here is applied to the Jews because they had rejected the Messiah; had become opposed to God; and were therefore rejected by him.<p>For your sakes - For your advantage. Their rejection has become the occasion by which the gospel has been preached to you; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-19.htm">Romans 11:19-20</a>.<p>As touching the election - So far as the purpose of election is concerned. That is, the election of their fathers and of the nation to be the special people of God.<p>They are beloved - God still regards them with interest; has purposes of mercy toward them; intends still to do them good. This does not, mean that he approved of their conduct or character, or that he had for them the same kind of affection which he would have had if they had been obedient. God does not love a sinful character; but he may have still purposes of mercy, and regard people with deep interest on whom he intends yet to bestow mercy.<p>For the fathers' sakes - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>. He had chosen their fathers to be His special people. He had made many promises to Abraham respecting his seed, and extended these premises to his remotest posterity. Though salvation is by grace, and not from human merit, yet God has respect to his covenant made with the fathers, and will not forget his promises. It is not on account of any merit of the fathers or of ancient saints, but solely because God had made a covenant with them; and this purpose of election would be manifest to their children in the latest times. As those contemplated in the covenant made with Abraham, God retained for them feelings of special interest; and designed their recovery to himself. It is clear here that the word "election" does not refer to external privileges; for Paul is not teaching the doctrine that they shall be restored to the external privileges of Jews, but that they shall be truly converted to God. Yet this should not be abused by others to lead them to security in sin. No man has any security of happiness, and of the favor of God, but he who complies with the terms of his mercy. His commands are explicit to repent and believe, nor can there be safety except in entire compliance with the terms on which he is willing to bestow eternal life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28, 29.

This denial of anthropopathy in God is asserted as a general truth, to be applied to his calling of "the fathers," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the patriarchs, and their seed after them, to be his people. It is true that, as is shown in ch. 4, there is a spiritual seed of Abraham, not necessarily of the house of Israel, to whom the promises in their ultimate scope were to be fulfilled; but the apostle regards it as impossible that the promises made primarily to the chosen people themselves should be revoked or fail of eventual fulfilment to them. </body></html>
