These were kept according to the election of grace. If then this election was of grace, it could not be of works, either performed or foreseen. Every truly good disposition in a fallen creature must be the effect, therefore it cannot be the cause, of the grace of God bestowed on him. Salvation from the first to the last must be either of grace or of debt. These things are so directly contrary to each other that they cannot be blended together. God glorifies his grace by changing the hearts and tempers of the rebellious. How then should they wonder and praise him! The Jewish nation were as in a deep sleep, without knowledge of their danger, or concern about it; having no sense of their need of the Saviour, or of their being upon the borders of eternal ruin. David, having by the Spirit foretold the sufferings of Christ from his own people, the Jews, foretells the dreadful judgments of God upon them for it, Ps 69. This teaches us how to understand other prayers of David against his enemies; they are prophecies of the judgments of God, not expressions of his own anger. Divine curses will work long; and we have our eyes darkened, if we are bowed down in worldly-mindedness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And David saith ... - This quotation is made from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-22.htm">Psalm 69:22-23</a>. This Psalm is repeatedly quoted as having reference to the events recorded in the New Testament. (See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-2.htm">Acts 1:2</a>.) This quotation is introduced immediately after one that undoubtedly refers to the Lord Jesus. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, "they gave me also gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink." The passage here quoted immediately follows as an imprecation of vengeance for their sins. "Let their table," etc. The quotation is not made, however, either literally from the Hebrew or from the Septuagint, but the sense only is retained. The Hebrew is, "Let their table before them be for a snare, and for those at peace, let it be for a gin." The Septuagint is, "Let their table before them be for a snare, and for a stumbling-block, and for an offence." The ancient Targum is, "Let their table which they had prepared before me be for a snare, and their sacrifices be for an offence."<p>The meaning is this. The word "table" denotes food. In this they expected pleasure and support. David prays that even this, where they expected joy and refreshment, might prove to them the means of punishment and righteous retribution. A snare is that by which birds or wild beasts were taken. They are decoyed into it, or walk or fly carelessly into it, and it is sprung suddenly on them. So of the Jews. The petition is, that while they were seeking refreshment and joy, and anticipating at their table no danger, it might be made the means of their ruin. The only way in which this could be done would be, that their temporal enjoyments would lead them away from God, and produce stupidity and indifference to their spiritual interests. This is often the result of the pleasures of the table, or of seeking sensual gratifications. The apostle does not say whether this prayer was right or wrong. The use which he seems to make of it is this, that David's imprecation was to be regarded in the light of a prophecy; that what he prayed for would come to pass; and that this had actually occurred in the time of the apostle; that their very enjoyments, their national and private privileges, had been the means of alienating them from God; had been a snare to them; and was the cause of their blindness and infidelity. This also is introduced in the psalm as a punishment for giving him vinegar to drink; and their treatment of the Messiah was the immediate cause why all this blindness had come upon the Jews.<p>A trap - This properly means anything by which wild beasts are taken in hunting. The word "snare" more properly refers to birds.<p>And a stumbling-block - Anything over which one stumbles or falls. Hence, anything which occasions us to sin, or to ruin ourselves.<p>And a recompense - The Hebrew word translated "what should have been for their welfare," is capable of this meaning, and may denote their recompense, or what is appropriately rendered to them. It means here that their ordinary comforts and enjoyments, instead of promoting their permanent welfare, may be the occasion of their guilt and ruin. This is often the effect of earthly comforts. They might lead us to God, and should excite our gratitude and praise; but they are often abused to our spiritual slumber and guilt, and made the occasion of our ruin. The rich are thus often most forgetful of God; and the very abundance of their blessings made the means of darkness of mind, ingratitude, prayerlessness, and ruin. Satisfied with them, they forget the Giver; and while they enjoy many earthly blessings, God sends barrenness into their souls. This was the guilt of Sodom, "pride, and fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>; and against this Moses solemnly warned the Jews; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11-12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-12</a>. This same caution might be extended to the people of this land, and especially to those who are rich, and are blessed with all that their hearts have wished. From the use which the apostle makes of this passage in the Psalms, it is clear that he regarded it rather as a prophetic denunciation for their sins - a prediction of what would be - than as a prayer. In his time it had been fulfilled; and the very national privileges of the Jews, on which they so much prided themselves, and which might have been so great blessings, were the occasion of their greater sin in rejecting the Messiah, and of their greater condemnation. Thus, their table was made a trap, etc.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. And David saith&#8212;(Ps 69:23), which in such a Messianic psalm must be meant of the rejecters of Christ.<p>Let their table, &c.&#8212;that is, Let their very blessings prove a curse to them, and their enjoyments only sting and take vengeance on them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 9,10. <span class="bld">David saith; </span> viz. in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-22.htm" title="Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.">Psalm 69:22</a>,23</span>. The apostle tieth not himself to the very words of the psalmist, but being guided by the same Spirit by which David wrote, he adds and alters some words, without diminishing the sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Let their table be made a snare, &c.:</span> some take these words for a prayer; others, a prophecy. David, in the person of Christ, (of whom he was a type), doth complain and prophesy of the extreme injuries and oppressions wherewith the Jews (his own people) should vex him; as that they should give him <span class="ital">gall for meat, </span> and in his thirst, give him <span class="ital">vinegar to drink, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-21.htm" title="For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not you.">Romans 11:21</a></span>. Therefore, by way of imprecation, he prayeth down the wrath of God upon them: particularly, he prophesies or prays, that all their most pleasant things might be turned to their destruction; that their understandings might be darkened, so as they shall discern nothing of heavenly things; that they might savour nothing but earthly things, and be unable to lift up their heads and hearts to God, and to his gospel. Now David having, by the Spirit of prophecy, prayed down such miseries upon the Jews, they must be fulfilled; therefore the general unbelief and hardness of heart that is amongst that people is not to be wondered at. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David saith,.... That is, Christ by the mouth of David, or David in the person of Christ; for the psalm out of which the following words are taken is a prophecy of the Messiah, as appears from some passages cited out of it in the New Testament, and applied to Christ; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-9.htm">Romans 11:9</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-21.htm">Romans 11:21</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a>; and what are here cited are not so much imprecations, as predictions of what should befall the Jews, by way of recompense for their ill usage of the Messiah, in giving him gall for meat, and vinegar for drink,  <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm">Matthew 27:34</a>, <p>let their table be made a snare, and a trap and a stumbling block. By their "table" may be meant, the altar; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a>; and the sacrifices offered up upon it, their meat offerings and drink offerings, and all others; likewise the laws concerning the difference of meats, and indeed the whole ceremonial law may be intended, which lay in meats and drinks, and such like things: now the Jews placing their justifying righteousness before God, in the observance of these rites and ceremonies, and imagining that by these sacrifices their sins were really expiated and atoned for, they neglected and submitted not to the righteousness of Christ, but went about to establish their own; so that that which should have led them to Christ, became an handwriting of ordinances against them, and rendered Christ of no effect to them: moreover, the sacred writings, which are full of spiritual food and divine refreshment, the prophecies of the Old Testament, which clearly pointed out Christ, not being understood, but misapplied by them, proved a trap, a snare, and a stumbling block to them; so that they rejected the true Messiah, which issued in their utter ruin and destruction: yea, the preaching of the Gospel, the salutary truths and wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ, were a stumbling block to the Jews, nay, even the savour of death unto death. Though these words may be literally understood of their table mercies, the necessary provisions of life, their common food and drink, of which they had great scarcity in their last wars; so that they not only by wicked methods stole it from one another, but ate what was forbidden by their law, and what was abhorrent to nature, as one is said to eat her own child; nor is it to be overlooked what is suggested by some, that the passover may be meant by their "table"; which was their grand yearly feast, and which they were eating (s) when they were surrounded and taken by the Roman army, like birds in a net, or beasts in a trap: and all this as <p>a recompense to them; a just judgment upon them, by way of retaliation for their ill treatment of Christ when on the cross, giving him gall and vinegar for his meat and drink. <p>(s) Josephus de Bello Jud. l. 6. c. 9. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And David saith, <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</span><p>(i) As unhappy birds are enticed by that which is their sustenance, and then killed, and so did that thing turn to the Jew's destruction, out of which they sought life, that is, the law of God, for the preposterous zeal of which they refused the Gospel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-9.htm" title="And David said, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense to them:...">Romans 11:9-10</a>.

The composer of this psalm is <span class="ital">not</span> David (in opposition to Hengstenberg, Hävernick), but some one of much later date; a circumstance which we must judge of analogously to the expression of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-43.htm" title="He said to them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,">Matthew 22:43</a>. The suffering theocrat of the psalm is, as such, a type of the Messiah, and His enemies a type of the unbelieving Jews; hence Paul could find the fulfilment of the passage in the <span class="greekheb">πώρωσις</span> of the latter. Consequently, in pursuance of this typical reference, the sense in which he takes the words is as follows: “<span class="ital">Let their table become to them for</span> (let it be turned for them into, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-20.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, That you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.">John 16:20</a>) <span class="ital">a snare, and for a chase, and for a trap, and</span> (so) <span class="ital">for a retaliation;</span>” <span class="ital">i.e., while they feast and drink securely and carelessly at their well-furnished table</span>, <span class="ital">let the fate of violence overtake them unawares</span>, just as wild beasts are surprised in a <span class="ital">snare</span>, and by the <span class="ital">capture of the chase</span>, and by a <span class="ital">trap;</span> and so must <span class="ital">retaliation</span> alight upon them for that which they have done (in rejecting, namely, faith on Christ). But <span class="ital">what</span> violent calamity is meant, the sequel expresses, namely: “<span class="ital">Darkened must their eyes become, that they may not see</span>,” <span class="ital">i.e. they must become spiritually blinded</span>, incapable of discerning the truth of salvation; and finally the same thing under another figure: “<span class="ital">And bend their back always</span>,” denoting the keeping them in <span class="ital">bondage</span>, and that, in the sense of the apostle, the <span class="ital">spiritual bondage</span> of the unfree condition of the inner life produced by the <span class="greekheb">πώρωσις</span>. The <span class="ital">hardening</span>, therefore, which Paul recognises as predicted in the passage, does not lie in <span class="greekheb">ἡ τράπεζα αὐτῶν</span> (Fritzsche),—which is not to be explained “of the <span class="ital">law</span> and its works, which was Israel’s food” (Philippi, following older expositors, also Tholuck),—but in <span class="greekheb">γενηθήτω εἰς παγίδα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and is more precisely indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-10.htm" title="Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always.">Romans 11:10</a>.
