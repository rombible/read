Some have thought that the deity was androgynous, others have conjectured that the feminine is used contemptuously. Baal was originally the sun-god. The sun, it may be remembered, is feminine in German and some other languages.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-4.htm" title="But what said the answer of God to him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal....">Romans 11:4-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">But what saith the answer </span>— Recollect the answer which God gave to this doleful complaint; <span class="ital">I have reserved to myself </span>— To maintain my honour and true worship, I have preserved by my providence and grace not fewer than seven thousand; <span class="ital">who have not bowed the knee to Baal </span>— Nor to the golden calves, nor complied with any of those idolatrous rites which have been established by iniquitous laws. <span class="ital">Even so at this present time </span>— As it was then, so it is now; bad as this generation of Israelites is, <span class="ital">there is a remnant </span>who continue faithful to God; <span class="ital">according to the election of grace </span>— According to that gracious purpose of God, whereby he hath chosen those, whether Jews or Gentiles, for his people, that break off their sins by repentance, and believe on Jesus, as the true Messiah and Saviour of the world, with their hearts unto righteousness. Among those who thus repented and believed, in the first age of Christianity, were many thousands of Jews. Of the election here spoken of, see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-28.htm" title="And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose....">Romans 8:28-30</a>. <span class="ital">And if by grace, then it is no more of works </span>— That is, of the merit of works, whether ceremonial or moral; whether of the Mosaic or any other law, except that of faith. In other words, it is no more an election according to any covenant of justice, like that made with our first parents before the fall, which required unsinning obedience, but according to the covenant of grace, made with man since the fall, which makes provision for pardoning his past sins, and renewing his fallen nature, and by which alone a sinful creature can be saved: <span class="ital">otherwise grace is no more grace — </span>The very nature of grace is lost. <span class="ital">But if it be of </span>the merit of <span class="ital">works, then it is no more grace, otherwise work is no more work </span>— No longer deserving the name, or is no longer meritorious, but the very nature of it is destroyed. There is something so absolutely inconsistent between the being justified by grace, and the being justified by the merit of works, that if you suppose either, you of necessity exclude the other. For what is given to works is the payment of a debt; whereas grace implies an unmerited favour. So that the same benefit cannot, in the very nature of things, be derived from both.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-10 There was a chosen remnant of believing Jews, who had righteousness and life by faith in Jesus Christ. These were kept according to the election of grace. If then this election was of grace, it could not be of works, either performed or foreseen. Every truly good disposition in a fallen creature must be the effect, therefore it cannot be the cause, of the grace of God bestowed on him. Salvation from the first to the last must be either of grace or of debt. These things are so directly contrary to each other that they cannot be blended together. God glorifies his grace by changing the hearts and tempers of the rebellious. How then should they wonder and praise him! The Jewish nation were as in a deep sleep, without knowledge of their danger, or concern about it; having no sense of their need of the Saviour, or of their being upon the borders of eternal ruin. David, having by the Spirit foretold the sufferings of Christ from his own people, the Jews, foretells the dreadful judgments of God upon them for it, Ps 69. This teaches us how to understand other prayers of David against his enemies; they are prophecies of the judgments of God, not expressions of his own anger. Divine curses will work long; and we have our eyes darkened, if we are bowed down in worldly-mindedness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The answer of God - &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  ho chre&#772;matismos. This word is used no where else in the New Testament. It means an oracle, a divine response. It does not indicate the manner in which it was done, but implies only that it was an oracle, or answer made to his complaint by God. Such an answer, at such a time, would be full of comfort, and silence every complaint. The way in which this answer was in fact given, was not in a storm, or an earthquake, but in a still, small voice; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-12</a>.<p>I have reserved - The Hebrew is, "I have caused to remain," or to be reserved. This shows that it was of God that this was done. Amidst the general corruption and idolatry he had restrained a part, though it was a remnant. The honor of having done it he claims for himself, and does not trace it to any goodness or virtue in them. So in the case of all those who are saved from sin and ruin, the honor belongs not to man, but to God.<p>To myself - For my own service and glory. I have kept them steadfast in my worship, and have not suffered them to become idolaters.<p>Seven thousand men - Seven is often used in the Scriptures to denote an indefinite or round number. Perhaps it may be so here, to intimate that there was a considerable number remaining. This should lead us to hope that even in the darkest times in the church, there may be many more friends of God than we suppose. Elijah supposed he was alone; and yet at that moment there were thousands who were the true friends of God; a small number, indeed, compared with the multitude of idolaters; but large when compared with what was supposed to be remaining by the dejected and disheartened prophet.<p>Who have not bowed the knee - To bow or bend the knee is an expression denoting worship; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-14.htm">Ephesians 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>.<p>To Baal - The word "Baal" in Hebrew means Lord, or Master. This was the name of an idol of the Phenicians and Canaanites, and was worshipped also by the Assyrians and Babylonians under the name of Bel; (compare the Book of Bel in the Apocrypha.) This god was represented under the image of a bull, or a calf; the one denoting the Sun, the other the Moon. The prevalent worship in the time of Elijah was that of this idol. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. seven thousand, that have not bowed the knee to Baal&#8212;not "the image of Baal," according to the supplement of our version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The answer of God; </span> the word properly signifieth the oracle, or answer of God given in the tabernacle from the mercy-seat; but it is generally taken for any Divine answer, or direction received from God: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-12.htm" title="And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.">Matthew 2:12</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-7.htm" title="By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.">Hebrews 11:7</a></span>, where the same word is used.

This word has, in the Septuagint version, sometimes a feminine article as here; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>; but in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>, from whence this passage is taken, the article is masculine, as it is also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a>, and in other places. This deity being either of both sexes, or of no distinguished sex; or it may be, the reason it has so often a feminine article is, because it was a young heifer, or in the form of one; so in the history of Tobias 1:5, it is said, that "all the tribes which apostatized together sacrificed",    , "to Baal the heifer". The apostle's view in mentioning this instance is to show, that when the church and cause of God are at the lowest, God has always some true worshippers of him; and that he never casts away his foreknown people, whose numbers are generally more than they are thought to be by the saints themselves; good men, as Elijah, may be mistaken in this matter; all which he accommodates to the then present state of God's people, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But what saith the answer of God unto him?

The Phoenician divinity <span class="greekheb">בַּעַל</span>, the adoration of which was very widely diffused (Keil, § 91) amongst the Jews, especially under the later kings, though not of long subsistence (see Ewald, Alterth. p. 304), is most probably to be regarded as the sun-god (Movers, Phönicier, I. p. 169 ff.; J. G. Müller in Herzog’s Encyklop. I. p. 639 f.), not as the planet Jupiter (Gesenius in the Hall. Encyklop. VIII. p. 384 ff.). It is remarkable—seeing that <span class="greekheb">בעל</span> (according to different local and ritual forms also in the plural) is a masculine noun—that in the LXX. and in the Apocrypha it has sometimes, and most frequently, the masculine article (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-41.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that there he might see the utmost part of the people.">Numbers 22:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm" title="And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.">Jdg 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm" title="And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.">1 Kings 16:31</a>, et al.), sometimes the feminine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-4.htm" title="I will also stretch out my hand on Judah, and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the priests;">Zephaniah 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-8.htm" title="For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.">Hosea 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-4.htm" title="Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.">1 Samuel 7:4</a>; always in Jer.; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/1-5.htm" title="Now all the tribes which together revolted, and the house of my father Nephthali, sacrificed unto the heifer Baal.">Tob 1:5</a>, et al.). That the LXX. should have thought <span class="greekheb">בעל</span> to be of the common gender, and to denote also Astarte (Reiche), is not probable for this reason, that in the LXX. not merely are the masculine Baal and Astarte often mentioned together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm" title="And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.">Jdg 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.">Jdg 10:6</a>, et al.), but also the feminine Baal and Astarte (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-4.htm" title="Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.">1 Samuel 7:4</a>). The view that the feminine article was assigned to <span class="greekheb">Βάαλ</span> contemptuously (Gesenius, in Rosenmüller’s Repert. I. p. 139), as also Tholuck and Ewald, Alterth. p. 302, assume, finds no sufficient support—seeing that <span class="greekheb">בעל</span> was a very well known divinity—in the feminine designation of idols unknown to them in the LXX. at <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/17-30.htm" title="And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,...">2 Kings 17:30-31</a>; cannot be justified by comparison of the Rabbinical designation of idols as <span class="greekheb">אֶלהוֹת</span>; and cannot be made good in the particular passages where the LXX. have the masculine or the feminine. To refer the phenomenon solely to an opinion of the LXX., who held <span class="greekheb">בעל</span> to be the name of a god and also that of a goddess, and therefore, according to the supposed connection, used now the masculine and now the feminine article,—the latter particularly, where the word occurs along with <span class="greekheb">עַשְׁתָּרוֹת</span> (Fritzsche), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm" title="And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.">Jdg 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.">Jdg 10:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-4.htm" title="Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.">1 Samuel 7:4</a>,—is improbable in itself (because of the unity of the Hebrew name), and cannot be maintained even in passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Jdg 3:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-3.htm" title="For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.">2 Kings 21:3</a> (comp. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-10.htm" title="And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.">1 Samuel 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-10.htm" title="And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none shall deliver her out of my hand.">Hosea 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-15.htm" title="And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.">Hosea 2:15</a>), without arbitrariness. An historical reason must prevail, and it appears the most feasible hypothesis that Baal was conceived as an androgynous divinity (Beyer, ad Selden. de Diis Syr. p. 273 f., Wetstein, Koppe, Olshausen, Philippi), although more precise historical evidence is wanting. The feminine article has been also explained by supplying a substantive (<span class="greekheb">εἰκόνι</span> by Erasmus, Luther, Beza, Grotius, Bengel, and others; <span class="greekheb">στήλῃ</span> by Glass, Estius; <span class="greekheb">θρησκείᾳ</span> by Cramer; even <span class="greekheb">δαμάλει</span> by Drusius, after <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/1-5.htm" title="Now all the tribes which together revolted, and the house of my father Nephthali, sacrificed unto the heifer Baal.">Tob 1:5</a>, but see Fritzsche on Tob.); but this is both erroneous and arbitrary, because at least the expression must have run <span class="greekheb">τῇ τοῦ Βάαλ</span>, since <span class="greekheb">בעל</span> has always the article.

Yet His unchanging faithfulness in keeping a people is not represented as a merely unconditional decree, having no relation to anything but His own will, for the seven thousand are described by their character: <span class="greekheb">οἵτινες οὐκ ἔκαμψαν γόνυ τῇ Βάαλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οἵτινες</span> is qualitative: <span class="ital">such</span> were those whom God reserved for Himself, men who never bowed knee to Baal. <span class="greekheb">Βάαλ</span> takes the fem. art[3] because it was often replaced in reading by <span class="greekheb">בּשֶׁת</span> (LXX <span class="greekheb">αἰσχύνη</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3] grammatical article.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">the answer of God</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">the oracular answer</span>.

The Heb. is, “And I have left in Israel seven thousand; all the knees that have not bowed, &c.” (LXX. has “And <span class="ital">thou shalt leave</span>, &c.”)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. It is hardly needful to point out how this metaphorical passage, like almost every other, secular or sacred, carries its qualifications and corrections with it. For example, the true Church of God existed ages before Abraham; it embraced Abel, Enoch, Noah. And no saint, however great, can be the “root” of the rest in the sense of being their source of life: the Divine Saviour alone can say “Abide <span class="ital">in me</span>.” And again, the figure here, if taken alone, would leave us with the impression that the Call of the Gentiles was an accident in the history of the Church, instead of being the great “Purpose of the Ages” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-11.htm" title="According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:">Ephesians 3:11</a>) to which the privileges and work of the Elder Covenant were but the mighty prelude. But St Paul writes for those who will read his revelation in the full light of Gospel-truth; and therefore he securely leaves the details to self-explanation or self-correction. Carefully so read, the passage tells us not of a higher level of grace and glory hereafter for Jewish saints as above Gentile saints, but of a gracious welcome back, and a special work for God, for repenting and believing Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-4.htm" title="But what said the answer of God to him?

It occurs, however, in the Septuagint with both the masculine and the feminine article. Various reasons are given for the use of the feminine, some supposing an ellipsis, the image of Baal; others that the deity was conceived as bisexual; others that the feminine article represents the feminine noun &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; shame Heb., bosheth, which was used as a substitute for Baal when this name became odious to the Israelites. </body></html>
