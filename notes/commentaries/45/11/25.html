The apostle calls the rejection of the Jews for a time, and their restoration after the conversion of the Gentiles is completed, <span class="ital">a mystery; </span>because it was a matter of the greatest importance to mankind, and because it had hitherto been kept a secret, like the doctrine of the mysteries among the Greeks, which was discovered to none but the initiated. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a>. <span class="ital">That blindness in part </span>— That is, as to the greatest part of them, a remnant only being now brought to the faith; <span class="ital">is happened to Israel </span>— For a certain time, for Israel is neither totally nor finally rejected; <span class="ital">until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in </span>— Here the Christian Church is represented as a great temple, erected for all nations to worship in. And the coming of the Gentiles into this temple, or church, to worship, signifies their conversion to Christianity; a conversion which has hitherto only taken place in a small degree. For, as Whitby observes, (Appen. to Romans xi,) “If the known regions of the world be divided into thirty parts, the Christian part is only as five, the Mohammedan as six, and the idolatrous as nineteen.” And, alas! of the part said to be Christian, how few are Scriptural Christians, possessed of the <span class="ital">Spirit of Christ, </span>without which we are none of his! <span class="ital">And so all Israel shall be saved </span>— Shall be brought to believe in Jesus as the true Messiah, and so shall be put into the way of obtaining salvation, being convinced of the truth by the coming in of the Gentiles. <span class="ital">As it is written, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-20.htm" title="And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn from transgression in Jacob, said the LORD.">Isaiah 59:20</a>, <span class="ital">There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer </span>— Being the son of David, he is said, by the apostle, to come out of Sion, the city of David, and the seat of his kingdom, rather than <span class="greekheb">ενεκεν Σιων</span>, <span class="ital">for the sake of Sion, </span>the words used by the LXX.; whose translation of this passage, in other respects, the apostle adopts. It differs, however, in some degree, from the Hebrew original, both in this and the next clause; for that is, <span class="ital">the Redeemer shall come to Sion, </span>and <span class="ital">unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, </span>which, no doubt, was the exact sense of the prophet’s words. But since the coming of Christ as a deliverer to the Jews was all that the apostle’s argument required, he quotes the passage merely to prove that point, and does not notice the variation of the Greek translation from the original Hebrew. It being certain, however, that the general tenor of God’s covenant with Israel gave no hope of their deliverance and restoration, after rejection and chastisement, but in a way of repentance and reformation, the apostle properly observes, that when the deliverer came, he should <span class="ital">turn away ungodliness from Jacob </span>— Which, as it was not done by Christ at his first coming, will doubtless be accomplished in some future period by an extraordinary display of his mercy and grace. <span class="ital">For this is my covenant unto </span>— Or rather <span class="ital">with them, when I shall take away their sins </span>— That is, when their sins, as a nation, are remitted, it shall be to bring them again into covenant with myself.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:22-32 Of all judgments, spiritual judgments are the sorest; of these the apostle is here speaking. The restoration of the Jews is, in the course of things, far less improbable than the call of the Gentiles to be the children of Abraham; and though others now possess these privileges, it will not hinder their being admitted again. By rejecting the gospel, and by their indignation at its being preached to the Gentiles, the Jews were become enemies to God; yet they are still to be favoured for the sake of their pious fathers. Though at present they are enemies to the gospel, for their hatred to the Gentiles; yet, when God's time is come, that will no longer exist, and God's love to their fathers will be remembered. True grace seeks not to confine God's favour. Those who find mercy themselves, should endeavour that through their mercy others also may obtain mercy. Not that the Jews will be restored to have their priesthood, and temple, and ceremonies again; an end is put to all these; but they are to be brought to believe in Christ, the true become one sheep-fold with the Gentiles, under Christ the Great Shepherd. The captivities of Israel, their dispersion, and their being shut out from the church, are emblems of the believer's corrections for doing wrong; and the continued care of the Lord towards that people, and the final mercy and blessed restoration intended for them, show the patience and love of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ignorant of this mystery - The word "mystery" means properly what is "concealed, hidden, or unknown." And it especially refers, in the New Testament, to the truths or doctrines which God had reserved to himself, or had not before communicated. It does not mean, as with us often, that there was anything unintelligible or inscrutible in the nature of the doctrine itself, for it was commonly perfectly plain when it was made known. Thus, the doctrine, that the division between the Jews and the Gentiles was to be broken down, is called a mystery, because it had been, to the times of the apostles, concealed, and was then revealed fully for the first time; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>. Thus, the doctrine which the apostle was stating was one that until then had been concealed, or had not been made known. It does not mean that there was anything unintelligible or incomprehensive in it, but until then it had not been made known.<p>Lest ye should be wise in your own conceits - Paul communicated the truth in regard to this, lest they should attempt to inquire into it; should speculate about the reason why God had rejected the Jews; and should he elated with the belief that they had, by their own skill and genius, ascertained the cause. Rather than leave them to vain speculations and self-gratulation, he chose to cut short all inquiry, by stating the truth about; their present and future state.<p>Blindness - Or hardness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7</a>.<p>In part - Not totally, or entirely. They are not absolutely or completely blinded. This is a qualifying expression; but it does not denote what part or portion, or for what time it is to continue. It means that the blindness in respect to the whole nation was only partial. Some were then enlightened, and had become Christians; and many more would he.<p>To Israel - To the Jews.<p>Until the fulness of the Gentiles ... - The word "fulness" in relation to the Jews is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm">Romans 11:12</a>. It means until the abundance or the great multitude of the Gentiles shall be converted. The word is not used elsewhere in respect to the Gentiles; and it is difficult to fix its meaning definitely. It doubtless refers to the future spread of the Gospel among the nations; to the time when it may be said that the great mass, the abundance of the nations, shall be converted to God. At present, they are, as they were in the times of the apostle, idolators, so that the mass of mankind are far from God. But the Scriptures have spoken of a time when the gospel shall spread and prevail among the nations of the earth; and to this the apostle refers. He does not say, however, that the Jews may not be converted until all the Gentiles become Christians; for he expressly supposes <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm">Romans 11:12-15</a> that the conversion of the Jews will have an important influence in extending the gospel among the Gentiles. Probably the meaning is, that this blindness is to continue until great numbers of the Gentiles shall be converted; until the gospel shall be extensively spread; and then the conversion of the Jews will be a part of the rapid spread of the gospel, and will be among the most efficient and important aids in completing the work. If this is the case, then Christians may labor still for their conversion. They may seek that in connection with the effort to convert the pagan; and they may toil with the expectation that the conversion of the Jews and Gentiles will not be separate, independent, and distinct events; but will be inter-mingled, and will be perhaps simultaneous. The word "fulness" may denote such a general turning to God, without affirming that each individual shall be thus converted to the Christian faith. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. For I would not &#8230; that ye should be ignorant of this mystery&#8212;The word "mystery," so often used by our apostle, does not mean (as with us) something incomprehensible, but "something before kept secret, either wholly or for the most part, and now only fully disclosed" (compare Ro 16:25; 1Co 2:7-10; Eph 1:9, 10; 3:3-6, 9, 10).<p>lest ye should be wise in your own conceits&#8212;as if ye alone were in all time coming to be the family of God.<p>that blindness&#8212;"hardness"<p>in part is happened to&#8212;"hath come upon"<p>Israel&#8212;that is, hath come partially, or upon a portion of Israel.<p>until the fulness of the Gentiles be&#8212;"have"<p>come in&#8212;that is, not the general conversion of the world to Christ, as many take it; for this would seem to contradict the latter part of this chapter, and throw the national recovery of Israel too far into the future: besides, in Ro 11:15, the apostle seems to speak of the receiving of Israel, not as following, but as contributing largely to bring about the general conversion of the world&#8212;but, "until the Gentiles have had their full time of the visible Church all to themselves while the Jews are out, which the Jews had till the Gentiles were brought in." (See Lu 21:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here he shows there is not only a possibility and probability, but a certainty of the Jews’ conversion and calling. This he calleth a <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">mystery, </span> or a secret; though it was revealed in the Scripture, (as you will hear), yet it was not understood; nay, the manner, the number, and the time of their conversion, is still concealed and hid from us. The calling of the Gentiles was a mystery, and a great secret; see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a></span>; and so is the calling and restoration of the Jews. There are three particulars of this <span class="ital">mystery, </span> which he makes known to the Gentiles (and he doth it the rather, lest they should swell with a high conceit of themselves, and proudly despise the Jews): two of them are in this verse; and the first is, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that blindness is happened to Israel in part</span> only; i.e. they were not all blinded or hardened; or this blindness should not last always, but for a time. The latter sense agrees best with the word <span class="ital">mystery; </span> for it was no secret that some of the Jews believed; this was told them before, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm" title="God has not cast away his people which he foreknew.

The apostle in order to raise the attention of the Gentiles to what he was about to deliver to them, not only styles them "brethren", expressing his affection for them, and their relation to him and other believing Jews, and to one another, being all one in Christ Jesus, partakers of the same grace, and heirs of the same glory; but also tells them, that what he had to acquaint them with was a "mystery", a thing secret and hidden, which had not been heard of and known, at least not so fully and clearly as he was about to reveal it; and because of his great respect for them, he was unwilling, as he says, <p>that ye should be ignorant of this mystery; he was desirous that they should abound and improve in all spiritual knowledge and judgment, and, among the rest, be better informed of this particular article, the call of the Jews: and his view in apprizing them of it is expressed in the following clause, <p>lest ye should be wise in your own conceits: lest they should imagine that they were the only wise and knowing persons, and be elated in their minds with their knowledge and understanding, and look with contempt upon the poor, blind, ignorant Jews, as if they were always to remain in such a state of darkness and infidelity. The thing he had to inform them of is, <p>that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; by Israel is meant the Jews, the descendants of Jacob, whose name was Israel. Philo the Jew observes (b), that this name signifies , "the vision of God"; indeed, Jacob had it given him when he wrestled with the angel, and saw God face to face, though it does not seem to be for that reason; however, blindness had now befallen the Jews, who had been favoured with a divine revelation, with the knowledge of God, his will and worship; and none were more blind than those who were called the servants and messengers of the Lord of hosts, as the Scribes and Pharisees, the priests and princes of the Jewish world. This "blindness" designs their unbelief, the hardness of their hearts, and darkness of their understandings with respect to God himself, whom they knew not in Christ; not as the Father of Christ; nor even the perfections of his nature, particularly his righteousness; which was the reason of their setting up their own righteousness, and of their non-submission to the righteousness of Christ: they were blind as to the Messiah; they knew him not, when he came; they saw no beauty and comeliness in him; could not discern the characters of him in Jesus, though they were so manifest; and rejected him notwithstanding the clear evidence of his ministry and miracles. They were in the dark about the sense of the prophecies of the Old Testament; a vail was upon their hearts when they read them, so that they understood them not, and could not see their accomplishment in Christ; they were even ignorant of the law, the spiritual nature, true use, and right end and scope of it; and it is no wonder that the Gospel should be hidden from them. This blindness "happened" to them not by chance, but befell them by the decree, and according to the will of God, who hardens whom he pleases; and according to various predictions in the Old Testament, cited in  <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14</a>; and in righteous judgment, for since they liked not to retain God and his Christ in their knowledge, it was but just in God to give them up to reprobate minds, to judicial blindness, and hardness of heart: but then this blindness only happened to them "in part"; not that it was only in some measure or some degree, for it was total, they were darkness itself, and had no spiritual and evangelic light at all on whom it fell; but that this blindness was not general with respect to persons, there were some few, a seed, a remnant, that were delivered from it, though the far greater part of the nation were involved in it, and continue in it to this day; and will do, "until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in": that is, till the whole number of God's elect among them, be called and brought into the Gospel church state, which in the latter day will be very great; when the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea; when the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ; and the abundance of the sea shall be converted, and the forces of the Gentiles shall come to the church, and multitudes of them shall flock thither, as doves to their windows: and since the blindness of the Jews is not yet removed, it seems plain that the full number of God's chosen ones among the Gentiles is not yet completed in regeneration; for as soon as ever they are all called and brought in, the vail will be taken away from the Jews, and they will be turned unto the Lord. <p>(b) De Temulentia, p. 251. &amp; De Sacrificiis Abel &amp; Cain, p. 151. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{13}</span> For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> come in.</span><p>(13) The blindness of the Jews is neither so universal that the Lord has no elect in that nation, neither will it be continual: for there will be a time in which they also (as the prophets have foretold) will effectually embrace that which they now so stubbornly for the most part reject and refuse.<p>(b) That you are not proud within yourselves.<p>(c) Into the Church.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in....">Romans 11:25-32</a>.

But how enigmatically, and in a manner how liable to misapprehension, would Paul have indicated the supposed thought, instead of simply and plainly writing <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτοῦ τὸ ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν</span>! especially as already, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm" title="Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?">Romans 11:12</a>, the analogous expression <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῶν</span> was used in the sense of “<span class="ital">their full number</span>.” Fritzsche also finds too little: <span class="ital">caterva gentilium</span>, so that only a <span class="ital">great multitude</span> is meant. Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>. We must observe the correlation of <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ μέρους</span> … <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> … <span class="greekheb">πᾶς</span>: a <span class="ital">part</span> of Israel is hardened, until the Gentiles <span class="ital">collectively</span> shall have come in, and, when that shall have taken place, then <span class="ital">all</span> Israel will be saved. The conversion of the Gentiles ensues by successive stages; but when their <span class="ital">totality</span> shall be converted, then the conversion of the Jews in their <span class="ital">totality</span> will also ensue; so that Paul sees the latter—which up to that epoch certainly also advances gradually in individual cases—ensuing, after the full conversion of the Gentiles, as the event completing the assemblage of the church and accomplishing itself probably in rapid development. All this, therefore, <span class="ital">before</span> the <span class="ital">Parousia</span>, not <span class="ital">by means of it</span>. Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-20.htm" title="And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached to you:">Acts 3:20</a>. The expression <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρωμα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐθνῶν</span> is therefore to be taken <span class="ital">numerically: the plena copia</span> of the Gentiles (of whom in the first instance only a <span class="ital">fraction</span> has come and is coming in), their <span class="ital">full number</span>. Rightly Theophylact: <span class="greekheb">πάντες</span>, but with arbitrary limitation he adds: <span class="greekheb">οἱ προεγνωσμένοι ἐθνικοί</span>. Just so, in substance, Augustine, Oecumenius, and many others, including even van Hengel: “plenus numerus gentilium, <span class="ital">quotquot comprehendebant proposita Dei</span>,” comp. Krummacher: “only the <span class="ital">elect</span> among the Gentiles.” The <span class="ital">collective multitude</span> of the Gentiles in the strict sense Hofmann seeks to get rid of, by making <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρωμα</span> serve only to emphasize the fact that <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔθνη</span> is to be thought of “in the full compass <span class="ital">of the notion</span>,” so that by <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐθνῶν</span> no <span class="ital">other</span> full amount is intended than that which would be expressed by <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔθνη</span> <span class="ital">itself</span>. Thus there would result as the sense: until <span class="ital">no people</span> of the Gentile world is any longer found outside the church. This is decidedly at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm" title="Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?">Romans 11:12</a>, and with the whole context down to its evident concluding verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-32.htm" title="For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.">Romans 11:32</a>), according to which not the <span class="ital">peoples as such</span> (in the lump, as it were), but all <span class="ital">persons</span> who compose them, must be the subjects of the entrance into the church and of the divine mercy.

In this concluding section Paul abandons the ground of argument for that of revelation. He has discussed the problems arising out of the rejection of Israel and the calling of the Gentiles, when taken in connection with the promises of God to His people; and he has tried to make it clear that in all His dealings with His people, God has acted righteously, that for all that has befallen them the Jews have full responsibility, and that a Divine purpose, with blessing in it to both Jew and Gentile, has indirectly been getting itself carried into effect through this perplexing history. The rejection of the Jews has led to the calling of the Gentiles, and the calling of the Gentiles, by provoking the Jews to jealousy, is eventually to lead to their conversion too. All this, it may be said, is matter of argument; it is more or less convincing as the argument appeals with less or greater force to our minds. It is Paul’s construction and interpretation of the facts before him, and his anticipation of the result in which they are likely to issue; but it has no greater authority than the reasoning by which he supports it, or the motives which suggest one line of reasoning upon the facts rather than another. We can understand how patriotism, and religious faith in God’s promise, and insight into the psychological influences which determine human conduct, all contribute some weight to his argument; but he is not content to rest upon argument alone the central truth he has been expounding—that the hardening of Israel is temporary as well as partial, and that when “the fulness of the Gentiles” has come in the hardening will cease, and all Israel be saved. He expressly puts this truth forward as a revelation (<span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25</a>). What this means psychologically we cannot tell, but it is clear that for Paul it was an essential part of the true religion, so far as he could make out the manner of its working in the world. He might try to lead the mind up to it along various lines of argument, or to confirm it by considerations of various kinds; but for him it had a Divine authority, antecedent to argument and independent of it. He sought arguments to make it credible and intelligible, not for his own sake, but for the sake of others. How much a revelation of this kind will weigh with the modern reader depends on the extent to which on general grounds he can recognise in Paul an inspired interpreter of Christianity. History, it must be admitted, throws no light on his words. The Gentiles are not fully gathered in; the time to say whether Israel as a whole is to have any distinct or decisive place in the final fulfilment of God’s gracious purpose is therefore not yet. One feels as if the nationalism of the passage fell short of Paul’s great word, There is neither Greek nor Jew; but there the Jews are, a problem to unbelief as well as to faith; think what we will of it, it is of them salvation comes; and it is at least as credible as the reverse (without considering Paul’s arguments at all) that Providence is not preserving them for nothing, and that in some such way as is here indicated there is a close connection between their salvation and the salvation of the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant</span>] Same word as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm" title="Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-8.htm" title="For we would not, brothers, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>.—Here St Paul leaves the image of the Olive Tree, which he had used to facilitate to his reader’s conception the idea of a restoration of Jews to the Church of the Messiah, now become the Universal Church. He now, in plain terms, reveals and predicts a great future Restoration.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">For:</span>”—the connexion indicated is somewhat thus: “My parable of the Olive Tree is no conjecture or peradventure, when it suggests a brighter future for Israel. <span class="ital">For</span> such a future is to come, in the purposes of God.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ignorant</span>] Whether for want of information, or want of reminders. Possibly the precise revelation of the future here made had never been made, in terms, before, though suggestions and intimations of it had often been heard. (Cp. perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-24.htm" title="And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.">Luke 21:24</a>.) So in another place, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>,) where the Apostle uses the same formula:—the hope of <span class="ital">Resurrection</span> had been abundantly revealed in a general way, but the <span class="ital">precise fact</span> that the buried saints should rise <span class="ital">before</span> the living saints should be transfigured was probably then first made known.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">mystery</span>] Here, as consistently in N. T., the Gr. word means a truth <span class="ital">undiscoverable by reason, but now revealed</span>. Our use of the words “mystery” and “mysterious,” is often misleading in these connexions, as it easily suggests the thought of <span class="ital">what cannot be understood</span>. The Gr. means, in fact, <span class="ital">a secret</span>, which, when told, may be found either partially to transcend the grasp of man’s conception, or to be quite within it. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a> we have a “mystery” revealed as a fact which yet (in detail at least) we cannot clearly conceive: in the present passage we have a “mystery” revealed which is far more within our reach of thought, viz. judicial blindness inflicted on the Jews as a body, and hereafter, at a definite point in the Plan of God, to be removed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wise in your own conceits</span>] Same word as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm" title="Be of the same mind one toward another.

The Gr. is, more literally, <span class="bld">wise</span>, or <span class="bld">sensible, at your own bar</span>; i.e. judged in the court of self-complacency.—The “wisdom” or “thoughtfulness” here in view is such as that rebuked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-19.htm" title="You will say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.">Romans 11:19</a>; that of a Gentile convert who thought much of his large insight into the Divine Plan because he saw in the rejection of the Jews not an accident but a deliberate opening of the door of grace to the world—and <span class="ital">there dismissed the subject</span>, careless whether there were, or not, any future mercy for Israel in the same Divine Plan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">blindness</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-7.htm" title="What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.">Romans 11:7</a>, “<span class="ital">were blinded</span>.” The noun here is cognate to the verb there. It occurs elsewhere in N. T., <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-5.htm" title="And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.">Mark 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm" title="Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:">Ephesians 4:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in part</span>] This gracious qualification is not necessary to the statement, in which the “blindness” or “hardening” is the emphatic thing. But St Paul will not omit to remind the Gentile Christian that even in the dark ages of Israel there ever has been, is, and will be, a “holy seed,” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm" title="But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.">Isaiah 6:13</a>,) an “election,” who behold and welcome the promised Salvation. Thus the hardening is never total; it is partial, though, alas, the hardened “<span class="ital">part</span>” is the large majority, till the great call of grace.—See further, long note above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-1.htm" title="I say then, Has God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.">Romans 11:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in</span>] The Gr. equally allows the rendering <span class="bld">until the fulness</span> &c. <span class="bld">come in</span>. This would not necessitate (as E. V. does) the inference that the call of grace to Israel was not to come till the in-coming of the “fulness of the Gentiles” <span class="ital">was over</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-15.htm" title="For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?">Romans 11:15</a> (q. v.) we have had it intimated that the conversion of Israel should be a means of immense grace to the world; as indeed it must be, in the nature of the case. In view of this, it seems best to explain the present verse as predicting that the in-coming of the nations to the Church of Christ shall have largely, but not perfectly, taken place when Israel is restored to grace; so that the closing stages of the in-coming may be directly connected with the promised revival of Israel, and may <span class="ital">follow</span> it in respect of time.—“<span class="ital">Come in</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—to the Fold, the Refuge, the City, of Messiah’s salvation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the fulness of the Gentiles</span>] Cp. note on “fulness” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm" title="Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?">Romans 11:12</a>.

It occurs frequently in the apocryphal books, mostly of secrets of state, or plans kept by a king in his own mind. This meaning illustrates the use of the word in passages like <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>, "mysteries of the kingdom of heaven" - secret purposes or counsels which God intends to carry into effect in His kingdom.
