It is merely an <span class= "ital">admission.</span> The Gentile is, as it were, a branch grafted into a stem that was none of his planting. Nor is his position absolutely secured to him. It is held conditionally on the tenure of faith. He ought, therefore, anxiously to guard against any failure in faith. For the moment God has turned towards him the gracious side of His providence, as towards the Jew He has turned the severe side. But this relation may easily be reversed, and the Jew received back into the favour which he once enjoyed.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">And.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">but.</span><p><span class= "bld">Among them</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> among the branches of the olive-tree generally, both those which are broken off and those which are suffered to remain.

If, as perhaps is probable, we ought to drop the second “and,” reading, “of the root of the fatness,” the sense is that the rich flow of sap in which the wild olive par-takes does not belong to the wild olive itself, but is all drawn from the root.<p>The evidence for the omission of the second “and” is that of the Vatican, Sinaitic, and rescript Paris manuscript—a strong combination.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:11-21 The gospel is the greatest riches of every place where it is. As therefore the righteous rejection of the unbelieving Jews, was the occasion of so large a multitude of the Gentiles being reconciled to God, and at peace with him; the future receiving of the Jews into the church would be such a change, as would resemble a general resurrection of the dead in sin to a life of righteousness. Abraham was as the root of the church. The Jews continued branches of this tree till, as a nation, they rejected the Messiah; after that, their relation to Abraham and to God was, as it were, cut off. The Gentiles were grafted into this tree in their room; being admitted into the church of God. Multitudes were made heirs of Abraham's faith, holiness and blessedness. It is the natural state of every one of us, to be wild by nature. Conversion is as the grafting in of wild branches into the good olive. The wild olive was often ingrafted into the fruitful one when it began to decay, and this not only brought forth fruit, but caused the decaying olive to revive and flourish. The Gentiles, of free grace, had been grafted in to share advantages. They ought therefore to beware of self-confidence, and every kind of pride or ambition; lest, having only a dead faith, and an empty profession, they should turn from God, and forfeit their privileges. If we stand at all, it is by faith; we are guilty and helpless in ourselves, and are to be humble, watchful, afraid of self-deception, or of being overcome by temptation. Not only are we at first justified by faith, but kept to the end in that justified state by faith only; yet, by a faith which is not alone, but which worketh by love to God and man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If some of the branches - The illustration here is taken from the practice of those who ingraft trees. The useless branches, or those which bear poor fruit, are cut off, and a better kind inserted. "If some of the natural descendants of Abraham, the holy root, are cast off because they are unfruitful, that is, because of unbelief and sin."<p>And thou - The word "thou" here is used to denote the Gentile, whom Paul was then particularly addressing.<p>Being a wild olive-tree - From this passage it would seem that the olive-tree was sometimes cultivated, and that cultivation was necessary in order to render it fruitful. The cultivated olive-tree is "of the a moderate height, its trunk knotty, its bark smooth and ash-colored, its wood is solid and yellowish, the leaves are oblong, and almost like those of the willow, of a green color, etc. The wild olive is smaller in all its parts." (Calmet.) The wild olive was unfruitful, or its fruit very imperfect and useless. The ancient writers explain this word by "unfruitful, barren." (Sehleusner.) This was used, therefore, as the emblem of unfruitfulness and barrenness, while the cultivated olive produced much fruit. The meaning here is, that the Gentiles had been like the wild olive, unfruitful in holiness; that they had been uncultivated by the institutions of the true religion, and consequently had grown up in the wildness and sin of nature. The Jews had been like a cultivated olive, long under the training and blessing of God.<p>Wert grafted in - The process of grafting consists in inserting a scion or a young shoot into another tree. To do this, a useless limb is removed; and the ingrafted limb produces fruit according to its new nature or kind, and not according to the tree in which it is inserted. In this way a tree which bears no fruit, or whose branches are decaying, may be recovered, and become valuable. The figure of the apostle is a very vivid and beautiful one. The ancient root or stock, that of Abraham, etc. was good. The branches - the Jews in the time of the apostle - had become decayed and unfruitful, and broken off. The Gentiles had been grafted into this stock, and had restored the decayed vigor of the ancient people of God; and a fruitless church had become vigorous and flourishing. But the apostle soon proceeds to keep the Gentiles from exaltation on account of this.<p>Among them - Among the branches, so as to partake with them of the juices of the root.<p>Partakest of the root - The ingrafted limb would derive nourishment from the root as much as though it were a natural branch of the tree. The Gentiles derived now the benefit of Abraham's faith and holy labors, and of the promises made to him and to his seed.<p>Fatness of the olive-tree - The word "fatness" here means "fertility, fruitfulness" - the rich juices of the olive producing fruit; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-9.htm">Judges 9:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17, 18.

This is to be understood, not of the exclusion of the Jews from their national church; for the persons designed by the "branches", were the principal members of it, as the civil and ecclesiastical rulers, the priests, Scribes, and Pharisees, and the far greater part of the people; and on the other hand, the apostles and followers of Christ were put out of their synagogues, and deemed by them heretics and apostates: nor of the destruction of the Jewish nation, city, and temple; for as yet they existed as a nation, their city of Jerusalem was in being, and their temple standing: but of their being left out of the Gospel church, gathered among them, they not believing in the Messiah, but rejected and crucified him; and though afterwards the Gospel was preached to them, they despise it, contradicted, and blasphemed it; so that it pleased God to take it wholly away from them, when they might be truly said to be, "as branches broken off"; which phrase seems to be borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; they were withered, lifeless, and hopeless, being cast off by God, and neglected by his ministers, the Gospel being removed from them, and they without the means of grace and salvation: and this was the case of the generality of the people; for though the apostle only says "some", making the best of it in their favour against the Gentiles, and speaking in the softest terms; yet they were only a few, a seed, a remnant, that were taken into the Gospel church, and the rest were blinded, hardened, rejected, and left out for their unbelief: <p>and thou being a wild olive tree: speaking to the Gentiles, to some, not to all of them; for not a whole tree, but a part of one, what is cut out of it, a scion from it is grafted into another; and so they were a certain number which God took out from among the Gentiles, to be a people for his name and glory, and who before conversion were comparable to a wild olive tree; for though they might have some show of morality, religion, and worship, yet lived in gross ignorance, superstition, idolatry, and profaneness were destitute of a divine revelation, of all spiritual light and knowledge, of true righteousness and the grace of God; were barren and unfruitful in good works, were without hope, God and Christ in the world. This metaphor rather regards their character, case, and manners, than their original; in respect of which they and the Jews were on a level, being by nature equally corrupt, and children of wrath; and yet though a wild olive tree, were <p>grafted amongst them; meaning either the broken branches, in whose stead they were grafted; the Syriac version favours this sense, reading it  "in their place"; as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-19.htm">Romans 11:19</a>; and so the Ethiopic version: or rather the believing Jews, of whom the first Gospel church and churches consisted; for the Jews first trusted in Christ, received the firstfruits of the Spirit, and were first incorporated into a Gospel church state; and then the Gentiles which believed were received among them. The first coalition of Jews and Gentiles, or the ingrafting of the Gentiles in among the Jews that believed, was at Antioch, when dropping their distinctive names of Jews and Gentiles, they took the common name of Christians,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>. So that this is not to be understood of an ingrafting into Christ unless by a visible profession, but of being received into a Gospel church state; which is signified by the "olive tree" in the next clause: <p>and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree; the Gospel church is so called for its excellency the olive tree being a choice tree, as they were a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people; for its fruitfulness, bringing forth berries that are wholesome, delightful, and useful, so the saints are filled with the fruits of grace, and good works, which are by Christ to the praise and glory of God; for its beauty when laden with fruit, so a Gospel church is beautiful maintaining the purity of Gospel doctrine, discipline, worship and conversation; "his beauty shall be as the olive tree", <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; and for its verdure and durableness, and growing on the mountains, all which may denote the continuance and firmness of the church of Christ. Now the Gentiles being grafted into a Gospel church state with the believing Jews, partook of the same root and fatness as they did, being built upon the same "foundation of the apostles prophets", <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>; rooted, grounded, and built up in the same church state they enjoyed the same privileges, had the doctrines of Christ and his apostles preached to them, communicated with them in the ordinances of the Gospel, and were satisfied with the goodness and fatness of the house of God; for they became "fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the Gospel", <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>, the apostle speaks according to the nature of the olive tree, which is unctuous, from whence an oil is taken, which makes the face of man to shine, the fruit of which fattens those that are lean; and hence it loses not its leaves,    , "because of its heat and fatness", as Plutarch (x) says. <p>(x) Sympos. l. 8. qu. 10. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> among them, and with them <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</span><p>(10) There is no reason why the Gentiles who have obtained mercy, should triumph over the Jews who condemn the grace of God, seeing they are grafted in place of the Jews.

And from this also the general doctrine may be gathered and taken, that we ought to be zealous for God's glory, even in regards to our neighbours: and we should be very far from bragging and glorying because we are preferred before others by a singular grace.<p>(q) In place of those branches which are broken off.<p>(r) It is against the common manner of farming, that the barren juice of the young shoot is changed with the juice of the good tree.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;...">Romans 11:17-24</a>.

In thus addressing the Gentile in the second person singular, the apostle brings his warning home to any individual Gentile Christian who might be inclined to boast; though regarding him still as representing Gentile believers generally. They are compared to slips of the wild olive tree (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">oleaster</span>), which was unproductive (cf.

Whether or not such a reversal of the usual system of grafting would have the imagined effect does not matter, as long as the illustration serves St. Paul's purpose well, and helps us to grasp, his conception. The common process is - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"... to marry<br />A gentle scion to the wildest stock,<br />And make conceive a bark of baser kind,<br />By bud of nobler race."</span> In the illustration before us a scion of wildest stock is supposed to be made to conceive through the stock of nobler race to which it is united. The selecting the olive tree for illustration is happy, inasmuch as it was not only a characteristic produce of Palestine, but also regarded as symbolical of a plant of grace; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>, "I am a green olive tree in the house of God;" also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-6.htm">Hosea 14:6</a>. See also the parable of Jotham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8, 9</a>), where the trees apply first to the olive tree to be their king; and observe also there the word "fatness," used here also by St. Paul: <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; (LXX.). The "branches" against which the ingrafted scion is warned not to boast are not exclusively either the broken-off or the remaining ones, but, as the sequel shows, the natural branches of the tree generally. The Gentile Christian is not to contemn the race of Israel because so large a portion of it is at present apart from the Church and under judgment; for it is, after all, from the stock of Israel, into which he has been engrafted, that he derives all his own fertility. As to the Christian Church being ever regarded as derived from that of Israel, the fulfilment and outcome of the ancient covenant, see note on Romans 1:2; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>, "For salvation is of the Jews." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Branches were broken off (&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-32.htm">Matthew 24:32</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-8.htm">Mark 11:8</a>. The derivation of &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; branches, from &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9; to break, is exhibited in the word-play between the noun and the verb: kladon, exeklasthesan.<p>A wild olive-tree (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>To be taken as an adjective, belonging to the wild olive. Hence Rev., correctly, rejects tree, since the Gentiles are addressed not as a whole but as individuals. Meyer says: "The ingrafting of the Gentiles took place at first only partially and in single instances; while the thou addressed cannot represent heathendom as a whole, and is also not appropriate to the figure itself; because, in fact, not whole trees, not even quite young ones are ingrafted, either with the stem or as to all their branches. Besides, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-24.htm">Romans 11:24</a> contradicts this view."<p>Wert graffed in among them (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>The verb occurs only in this chapter. From &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; a sting, a goad. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-9.htm">Revelation 9:9</a>. Thus, in the verb to graft the incision is emphasized. Some render in their place, instead of among them; but the latter agrees better with partakest. Hence the reference is not to some of the broken off branches in whose place the Gentiles were grafted, but to the branches in general.<p>With them partakest (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Lit., as Rev., didst become partaker with them. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a>; and see on partners, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>. With them, the natural branches.<p>Of the root and fatness (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>The best texts omit &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; and, and render of the root of the fatness: the root as the source of the fatness.<p>Paul's figure is: The Jewish nation is a tree from which some branches have been cut, but which remains living because the root (and therefore all the branches connected with it) is still alive. Into this living tree the wild branch, the Gentile, is grafted among the living branches, and thus draws life from the root. The insertion of the wild branches takes place in connection with the cutting off of the natural branches (the bringing in of the Gentiles in connection with the rejection of the Jews). But the grafted branches should not glory over the natural branches because of the cutting off of some of the latter, since they derive their life from the common root. "The life-force and the blessing are received by the Gentile through the Jew, and not by the Jew through the Gentile. The spiritual plan moves from the Abrahamic covenant downward, and from the Israelitish nation outward" (Dwight).<p>The figure is challenged on the ground that the process of grafting is the insertion of the good into the inferior stock, while here the case is reversed. It has been suggested in explanation that Paul took the figure merely at the point of inserting one piece into another; that he was ignorant of the agricultural process; that he was emphasizing the process of grace as contrary to that of nature. References to a custom of grafting wild upon good trees are not sufficiently decisive to warrant the belief that the practice was common. Dr. Thomson says: "In the kingdom of nature generally, certainly in the case of the olive, the process referred to by the apostle never succeeds. Graft the good upon the wild, and, as the Arabs say, 'it will conquer the wild;' but you cannot reverse the process with success.... It is only in the kingdom of grace that a process thus contrary to nature can be successful; and it is this circumstance which the apostle has seized upon to magnify the mercy shown to the Gentiles by grafting them, a wild race, contrary to the nature of such operations, into the good olive tree of the church, and causing them to flourish there and bring forth fruit unto eternal life. The apostle lived in the land of the olive, and was in no danger of falling into a blunder in founding his argument upon such a circumstance in its cultivation" ("Land and Book, Lebanon, Damascus and Beyond Jordan," p. 35). Meyer says: "The subject-matter did not require the figure of the ordinary grafting, but the converse - the grafting of the wild scion and its ennoblement thereby. The Gentile scion was to receive, not to impart, fertility." </body></html>
