These were kept according to the election of grace. If then this election was of grace, it could not be of works, either performed or foreseen. Every truly good disposition in a fallen creature must be the effect, therefore it cannot be the cause, of the grace of God bestowed on him. Salvation from the first to the last must be either of grace or of debt. These things are so directly contrary to each other that they cannot be blended together. God glorifies his grace by changing the hearts and tempers of the rebellious. How then should they wonder and praise him! The Jewish nation were as in a deep sleep, without knowledge of their danger, or concern about it; having no sense of their need of the Saviour, or of their being upon the borders of eternal ruin. David, having by the Spirit foretold the sufferings of Christ from his own people, the Jews, foretells the dreadful judgments of God upon them for it, Ps 69. This teaches us how to understand other prayers of David against his enemies; they are prophecies of the judgments of God, not expressions of his own anger. Divine curses will work long; and we have our eyes darkened, if we are bowed down in worldly-mindedness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I say then - This expression is to be regarded as conveying the sense of an objection. Paul, in the previous chapters, had declared the doctrine that all the Jews were to be rejected. To this a Jew might naturally reply, Is it to be believed, that God would cast off his people whom he had once chosen; to whom pertained the adoption, and the promises, and the covenant, and the numerous blessings conferred on a favorite people? It was natural for a Jew to make such objections. And it was important for the apostle to show that his doctrine was consistent with all the promises which God had made to his people. The objection, as will be seen by the answer which Paul makes, is formed on the supposition that God had rejected "all his people," or "cast them off entirely." This objection he answers by showing,<p>(1) That God had saved him, a Jew, and therefore that he could not mean that God had east off all Jews <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-1.htm">Romans 11:1</a>;<p>(2) That now, as in former times of great declension, God had reserved a remnant <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2-5</a>;<p>(3) That it accorded with the Scriptures that a part should be hardened <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-6.htm">Romans 11:6-10</a>;<p>(4) That the design of the rejection was not final, but was to admit the Gentiles to the privileges of Christianity <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11-24</a>;<p>(5) That the Jews should yet return to God, and be reinstated in his favor: so that it could not be objected that God had finally and totally cast off his people, or that he had violated his promises.<p>At the same time, however, the doctrine which Paul had maintained was true, that God had taken away their exclusive and special privileges, and had rejected a large part of the nation.<p>Cast away - Rejected, or put off. Has God so renounced them that they cannot be any longer his people.<p>His people - Those who have been long in the covenant relation to him: that is, the Jews.<p>God forbid - Literally, it may not or cannot be. This is an expression strongly denying that this could take place; and means that Paul did not intend to advance such a doctrine; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-16.htm">Luke 20:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-6.htm">Romans 3:6</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-15.htm">Romans 6:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a>.<p>For I am also an Israelite - To show them that he did not mean to affirm that all Jews must of necessity be cast off, he adduces his own case. He was a Jew; and yet he looked for the favor of God, and for eternal life. That favor he hoped now to obtain by being a Christian; and if he might obtain it, others might also. "If I should say that all Jews must be excluded from the favor of God, then I also must be without hope of salvation, for I am a Jew."<p>Of the seed of Abraham - Descended from Abraham. The apostle mentions this to show that he was a Jew in every respect; that he had a title to all the privileges of a Jew, and must be exposed to all their liabilities and dangers. If the seed of Abraham must of necessity be cut off, he must be himself rejected. The Jews valued themselves much on having been descended from so illustrious an ancestor as Abraham <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; and Paul shows them that he was entitled to all the privileges of such a descent; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-5</a>.<p>Of the tribe of Benjamin - This tribe was one that was originally located near Jerusalem. The temple was built on the line that divided the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. It is not improbable that it was regarded as a special honor to have belonged to one of those tribes. Paul mentions it here in accordance with their custom; for they regarded it as of great importance to preserve their genealogy, and to be able to state not only that they were Jews, but to designate the tribe and family to which they belonged. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 11<p>Ro 11:1-36.

God forbid&#8212;Our Lord did indeed announce that "the kingdom of God should be taken from Israel" (Mt 21:41); and when asked by the Eleven, after His resurrection, if He would at that time "restore the kingdom to Israel," His reply is a virtual admission that Israel was in some sense already out of covenant (Ac 1:9). Yet here the apostle teaches that, in two respects, Israel was not "cast away"; First, Not totally; Second, Not finally. First, Israel is not wholly cast away.<p>for I also am an Israelite&#8212;See Php 3:5, and so a living witness to the contrary.<p>of the seed of Abraham&#8212;of pure descent from the father of the faithful.<p>of the tribe of Benjamin&#8212;(Php 3:5), that tribe which, on the revolt of the ten tribes, constituted, with Judah, the one faithful kingdom of God (1Ki 12:21), and after the captivity was, along with Judah, the kernel of the Jewish nation (Ezr 4:1; 10:9).<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-1.htm" title="I say then, Has God cast away his people?

Some might be ready to say: If this be so, then God hath cast away his covenant people, which he hath promised not to do; see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-14.htm" title="For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.">Psalm 94:14</a></span>. To this he answers, first, by his accustomed form of denial: <span class="ital">God forbid; </span> and then he proceeds to show, that the rejection of the Jews was neither total nor final. That it was not total, he proves, first, by a particular instance in the following words. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I also am an Israelite; </span> i.e. I am a Jew by descent, of the seed of Abraham according to the flesh, and yet am not cast off by God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the tribe of Benjamin:</span> some think this is added to intimate, that he was born of an honourable tribe, out of which king Saul sprang, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm" title="Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.">1 Samuel 9:1</a></span>, and Esther the queen, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-5.htm" title="Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;">Esther 2:5</a></span>. Others think this is added for a contrary reason; lest his calling should be ascribed to the dignity of his tribe, he says, he was of Benjamin, the last and least of all the tribes. And others rather think, that this particular recital of his genealogy is only to show, that he was a Jew by nature and nation, and not a proselyte converted to the faith: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm" title="Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;">Philippians 3:5</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I say then, hath God cast away his people?.... The Alexandrian, copy adds here, "whom he foreknew", as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>, upon the citation of the above passages out of Moses and Isaiah, relating to the calling of the Gentiles, and the rejection of the Jews, the apostle saw an objection would arise, which he here takes up from the mouth of an adversary, and proposes it; in which is suggested, that God has cast away all his people the Jews, according to this count; and if so, where is his covenant with Abraham? what is become of his promises? and how is his faithfulness to be accounted for? and what hope can any Israelite have of ever obtaining salvation? than which, nothing can be thought more injurious to God, and absurd in itself. This was an old prejudice of the Jewish nation, and still continues, that God never would, nor has he cast them away, even in their present condition; it is one of the articles of their creed, received by the Karaites (o), a sect among them, that <p>"the blessed God   , "hath not cast away the men of the captivity", though they are under the chastisements of God; but it is fit that they should every day obtain salvation by the hands of Messiah, the Son of David.'' <p>Now to this objection the apostle makes answer; "first", in his usual way, <p>God forbid, when anything was objected which was displeasing to him, abhorred by him, which was not agreeable to the perfections of God, to the truth of his word, and promises, and could by no means be admitted of; and next by observing his own case, which was a standing instance to the contrary; for God had chosen him unto eternal salvation, Christ had redeemed him by his blood, and he was effectually called by grace; and as to his eternal state, he had no doubt or scruple about it; and besides, the Lord had made him a minister of the Gospel, had greatly qualified him for that work, had raised him to the high office of an apostle, and had made him very useful to the souls of many, both Jews and Gentiles; and yet he was one of the nation of the Jews, and therefore God had not cast them all away, as the objection insinuates: <p>for I also am an Israelite; according to the flesh, by lineal descent from Jacob or Israel; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-22.htm">2 Corinthians 11:22</a>; as well as in a spiritual sense: <p>of the seed of Abraham; "the grandfather of Israel"; the head of the Jewish nation he was, both of his natural and of his spiritual seed, who is the father of us all: <p>of the tribe of Benjamin; a very little tribe, which in the time of the Judges was near being destroyed, and, upon the return from the captivity of Babylon, was very small, as it was at this time; and yet God had not cast away this, much less all the tribes of Israel. <p>(o) Apud Trigland. de Sect.

Thus far St Paul has stated the adverse side of the case of Israel. He has shewn (1) that the Divine Promise never pledged eternal light and life to <span class="ital">all</span> Abraham’s descendants; (2) that God is sovereign in His grants of mercy; (3) that the true work of the elder Dispensation was to prepare for the later; (4) that both Gentile faith and Jewish unbelief were distinctly foretold in the Law and the Prophets. And now, true to his main purpose throughout this argument, he turns to state the happier side; and this in two main aspects. First he reiterates the truth of the Divine Election, but now in its <span class="ital">positive</span> aspect—the existence always of a believing Israel within the unbelieving mass. Secondly, he predicts a time when even in the mass Israel should turn to the true Messiah, be restored to the Church, and become thus an influence of vast good for the world.—“<span class="ital">Therefore:</span>”—i.e. as the practical result from my previous account of sin and judgment in the case of Israel.

Its Root is Abraham and the Patriarchs. Its Stem is the Church of the Old Testament, when in a certain sense (that of external privilege) the Church coincided with the Nation of Israel, and when at least the vast majority of true believers were also physically children of Abraham. Its branches (by a slight modification of metaphor) are potential believers, whether Jewish or Gentile. If Jewish, their faith in Jesus as Messiah is viewed as <span class="ital">retaining</span> them in the Church; if Gentile, their faith “<span class="ital">grafts</span>” them into the stem of the covenant-congregation.

He answers - No; impossible! God's ancient covenant with his people stands; the remnant of believers even now is a sign of his continued favour to his ancient people, as was, in the time of Elijah, the remnant that had not bowed the knee to Baal; nor does the fact of its being a remnant only imply now, any more than then, that the nation as such is cast off; and further, the calling of the Gentiles, far from being intended to exclude God's ancient people, will be the means eventually of bringing it wholly in. Such is the apostle's prophetic vision of the future, in view of which he bursts at the end of the chapter into glowing admiration of the inscrutable ways of God. In the course of it also (vers. 17-25) he introduces a warning to Gentile believers not to pride themselves against the Jews because of present preference to them, or to regard their own position of privilege as indefeasible. It must still be borne in mind that it is the position before God of Israel <span class="accented">as a nation</span> that is all along in view. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I say then, Hath God east away his people!

I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Even so at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace</span>. The usual interpretation of this whole passage, and notably that of the ancients, has been to take the proof of God not having cast off his people as beginning in ver. 1, with "for I also," etc., and all the rest to be in sequence. Chrysostom's explanation of the argument is to the following effect: God has not rejected his ancient people; for I myself am eminently of it; and I have been selected as a chief proclaimer and expounder of the gospel to the world; this would not have been the case if the nation had been cast off. But it may be said to me," You are only one of the ancient people; you are not the people." Nay, but I do not stand alone; there are thousands of Israelite believers as well as myself; and these are God's true people, the people whom he foreknew. And of them there may be more than we are aware of; it is as it was in the days of Elias; he had supposed himself to be left alone; but he was told that there were seven thousand with him who were God's true people still. And so now, there is a faithful remnant, the number of which is known to God alone, which is his people still, according to the election of grace. The same Father further understands the citation of the whole of the passage from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-14.htm">1 Kings 19:14</a>, though not required for the apostle's proof, to be intended as significant. It would have sufficed, he says, to cite only what was said about a remnant being left; but the whole complaint of Elias is cited, so as to show by the way that the present rejection of Christ and persecution of the Church by the majority of the Jews had also its counterpart in ancient times; and thus the apostle, he says, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the unbelieving Jews) <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>. It is to be observed that the above interpretation of the passage, which in its main points has been most generally adopted, goes on two suppositions; vie. that "for I also<span class="accented"></span>," in ver. 1, is the first part of the proof that Israel is not cast off; and that "which he foreknew," in ver. 2, is intended as a limitation of the meaning of "his people." According to another view, decidedly upheld by Meyer, "for I also" is not part of the proof, but connected with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>: "I must needs say, God forbid! being myself a Hebrew of the Hebrews" Then, according to this view, comes the positive statement that God has not east off his people in the same general sense as before, after which the proof begins; the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> not being a limitation of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, but intended to enforce the idea of the impossibility of the final rejection of the race of Israel (cf. ver. 29; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-14.htm">Psalm 94:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a>). The fact that, throughout the chapter, it is Israel as a nation that is in view, and that the coming of the whole nation into the kingdom of Christ is contemplated in the end, adds decided probability to this view of the significance of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, though <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span>, etc., in ver. 1, may still be regarded as possibly part of the proof. St. Paul's designation of himself as "of the seed of Abraham" seems meant to express that he was an Israelite of pure descent, not a proselyte or descended from proselytes. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>, as well as here, he specifies his tribe as that of Benjamin, the tribe that with Judah had clung to the house of David, and had shared the privileges of Judah. The quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19</a>. is given freely from the LXX., varying a little, but not so as to affect the meaning. One variation is in the feminine, instead of masculine, article before <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span>, which has been explained by supposing <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> understood (so in the Authorized Version, "the <span class="accented">image</span> <span class="accented">of</span> Baal "), or by there having been a female Baal, or by the god having been supposed androgynous, or by the feminine being used of idols in contempt. St. Paul may possibly have found this reading in his copy of the LXX. The variation is of no importance with regard to the drift of the passage. "According to the election of grace," at the end of ver. 5, does not seem to be directly suggested by the passage cited, but added by St. Paul so as to make plain his position - maintained throughout the Epistle, and about to be pressed in this chapter on the consideration of Gentile Christians - that the calling of all, whether Jews or Gentiles, is "of grace," and not claimable as of right by any on the ground of the merit of their own works. And in order to enforce this position, he adds, <span class="cmt_word">And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the word "grace" loses its essential meaning. <span class="cmt_word">[But if of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.]</span> The preponderance of ancient authorities is against the retention of the clause within brackets, which does not seem required.
