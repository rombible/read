Etymologically, the word translated “slumber” would seem to agree better with the marginal rendering, “remorse.” It comes from a root meaning to “prick or cut with a sharp instrument.” There happens to be another root somewhat similar, but certainly not connected, which means “drowsiness,” “slumber.” Hence, where the word in the text has been used to render the Hebrew word for “slumber,” it has been thought that there was a confusion between the two. It appears, however, from the LXX. usage, that the sense of “slumber” had certainly come to attach to the word here used by St. Paul. From the notion of a sharp wound or blow came to be derived that of the bewilderment or stupefaction consequent upon such a blow, and hence it came to signify stupor in general.<p>The quotation is a free combination of two passages of the LXX. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm" title="For the LORD has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers has he covered.">Isaiah 29:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-4.htm" title="Yet the LORD has not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.">Deuteronomy 29:4</a>), no doubt put together by the Apostle from memory.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-10 There was a chosen remnant of believing Jews, who had righteousness and life by faith in Jesus Christ. These were kept according to the election of grace. If then this election was of grace, it could not be of works, either performed or foreseen. Every truly good disposition in a fallen creature must be the effect, therefore it cannot be the cause, of the grace of God bestowed on him. Salvation from the first to the last must be either of grace or of debt. These things are so directly contrary to each other that they cannot be blended together. God glorifies his grace by changing the hearts and tempers of the rebellious. How then should they wonder and praise him! The Jewish nation were as in a deep sleep, without knowledge of their danger, or concern about it; having no sense of their need of the Saviour, or of their being upon the borders of eternal ruin. David, having by the Spirit foretold the sufferings of Christ from his own people, the Jews, foretells the dreadful judgments of God upon them for it, Ps 69. This teaches us how to understand other prayers of David against his enemies; they are prophecies of the judgments of God, not expressions of his own anger. Divine curses will work long; and we have our eyes darkened, if we are bowed down in worldly-mindedness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>According as it is written - That is, they are blinded in accordance with what is written. The fact and the manner accord with the ancient declaration. This is recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-4.htm">Deuteronomy 29:4</a>. The same sentiment is found also substantially in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>. The principal place referred to here, however, is doubtless <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>, "For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets and your rulers hath he covered." The quotation is not however literally made either from the Hebrew or the Septuagint; but the sense is preserved. The phrase "according as" means upon the same principle, or in the same manner.<p>God hath given - Expressions like this are common in the Scriptures, where God is represented as having an agency in producing the wickedness and stupidity of sinners; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17-18</a>; see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a> note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-11.htm">Mark 4:11-12</a> note; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>. This quotation is not made literally. The Hebrew in Isaiah is, God has poured upon them the spirit of slumber. The sense, however, is retained.<p>The spirit of slumber - The spirit of slumber is not different from slumber itself. The word "spirit" is often used thus. The word "slumber" here is a literal translation of the Hebrew. The Greek word, however &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  katanuxeo&#772;s, implies also the notion of compunction, and hence in the margin it is rendered "remorse." It means any emotion, or any influence whatever, that shall benumb the faculties, and make them insensible. Hence, it here means simply insensibility.<p>Eyes that they should not see ... - This expression is not taken literally from any single place in the Old Testament; but expresses the general sense of several passages; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-4.htm">Deuteronomy 29:4</a>. It denotes a state of mind not different from a spirit of slumber. When we sleep, the eyes are insensible to surrounding objects, and the ear to sounds. Though in themselves the organs may be perfect, yet the mind is as though they were not; and we have eyes which then do not see, and ears which do not hear. Thus, with the Jews. Though they had all the proper faculties for understanding and receiving the gospel, yet they rejected it. They were stupid and insensible to its claims and its truths.<p>Unto this day - Until the day that Paul wrote. The characteristic of the Jews that existed in the time of Isaiah. existed also in the time of Paul. It was a trait of the people; and their insensibility to the demands of the gospel developed nothing new in them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. as it is written&#8212;(Isa 29:10; De 29:4).<p>God hath given&#8212;"gave"<p>them the spirit of slumber&#8212;"stupor"<p>unto this day&#8212;"this present day."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It is written; </span> viz. in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm" title="And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not.">Isaiah 6:9</a> 29:10</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The spirit of slumber; </span> the word signifieth, such a dead sleep, as those have, who are pricked or stung with venomous beasts, out of which they hardly or never awake. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto this day:</span> q.d.

These passages, with some others following, are produced by the apostle out of their own prophets, to take off their resentment against him; and lest, he should be thought to be severe upon them, when he said no more of them, but what had been prophesied long before concerning them. So Jarchi on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>; says, that Isaiah prophesies  , "concerning the transgressors of Israel". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> slumber, eyes that they <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</span><p>(6) And yet this hardness of heart does not come except by God's just decree and judgment, and yet without fault, when he so punishes the unthankful by taking from them all sense and perseverance and by doubling their darkness, that the benefits of God which are offered to them, do result in their just destruction.<p>(g) A very sound sleep, which takes away all sense.<p>(h) That is, eyes unfit to see.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-8.htm" title="(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) to this day.">Romans 11:8</a>.

The two passages combined read thus, from the Heb., “The Lord hath poured out (or spread) over you the spirit of deep sleep, and the Lord hath not given to you eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day:” The unbelief of Israel of old, traced by Moses and Isaiah to the mysterious withholding of grace, is here interpreted by St Paul to be a “prophecy in act” of the unbelief of Israel, and of its cause, in the days of Messiah.—It will be seen that the words “<span class="ital">unto this day</span>” are part of the quotation, and that therefore no brackets should be used in this verse.

It is not necessary that the passages here referred to should be regarded as directly prophetic of the time of Christ. It is enough for the purpose of the argument that God's people should be shown to be liable to the state of stupefaction described, without ceasing to be his people.
