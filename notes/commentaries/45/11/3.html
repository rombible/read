These were kept according to the election of grace. If then this election was of grace, it could not be of works, either performed or foreseen. Every truly good disposition in a fallen creature must be the effect, therefore it cannot be the cause, of the grace of God bestowed on him. Salvation from the first to the last must be either of grace or of debt. These things are so directly contrary to each other that they cannot be blended together. God glorifies his grace by changing the hearts and tempers of the rebellious. How then should they wonder and praise him! The Jewish nation were as in a deep sleep, without knowledge of their danger, or concern about it; having no sense of their need of the Saviour, or of their being upon the borders of eternal ruin. David, having by the Spirit foretold the sufferings of Christ from his own people, the Jews, foretells the dreadful judgments of God upon them for it, Ps 69. This teaches us how to understand other prayers of David against his enemies; they are prophecies of the judgments of God, not expressions of his own anger. Divine curses will work long; and we have our eyes darkened, if we are bowed down in worldly-mindedness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lord, they have killed ... - This is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>. The quotation is not literally made, but the sense is preserved. This was a charge which Elijah brought against the whole nation; and the act of killing the prophets he regarded as expressive of the character of the people, or that they were universally given to wickedness. The fact was true that they had killed the prophets, etc.; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>; but the inference which Elijah seems to have drawn from it, that there were no pious people in the nation, was not well founded.<p>And digged down - Altars, by the Law of Moses, were required to be made of earth or unhewn stones; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24-25</a>. Hence, the expression to dig them down means completely to demolish or destroy them.<p>Thine altars - There was one great altar in the front of the tabernacle and the temple, on which the daily sacrifices of the Jews were to be made. But they were not forbidden to make altars also elsewhere; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>. And hence they are mentioned as existing in other places; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2-3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-32.htm">1 Kings 18:32</a>. These were the altars of which Elijah complained as having been thrown down by the Jews; an act which was regarded as expressive of signal impiety.<p>I am left alone - I am the only prophet which is left alive. We are told that when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord, Obadiah took a hundred of them and hid them in a cave; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>. But it is not improbable that they had been discovered and put to death by Ahab. The account which Obadiah gave Elijah when he met him <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a> seems to favor such a supposition.<p>Seek my life - That is, Ahab and Jezebel seek to kill me. This they did because he had overcome and slain the prophets of Baal; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-1.htm">1 Kings 19:1-2</a>. There could scarcely be conceived a time of greater distress and declension in religion than this. It has not often happened that so many things that were disheartening have occurred to the church at the same period of time. The prophets of God were slain; but one lonely man appeared to have zeal for true religion; the nation was running to idolatry; the civil rulers were criminally wicked, and were the leaders in the universal apostasy; and all the influences of wealth and power were setting in against the true religion to destroy it. It was natural that the solitary man of God should feel disheartened and lonely in this universal guilt; and should realize that he had no power to resist this tide of crime and calamities. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. and I am left alone&#8212;"I only am left."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-10.htm" title="And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.">1 Kings 19:10</a>,14</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Digged down thine altars:</span> these were not the altars of the high places, for they are commended that cast them down; nor the altars in the temple at Jerusalem, for they were out of the reach of the ten tribes, against whom Elias complains: but such altars (say some) as the godly of the ten tribes did build to serve God with, when they were not permitted to go up to Jerusalem; in which case the building of private altars (as some learned Jews have affirmed) was allowed.

In classical usage it signifies life in the distinctness of individual existence, especially of man, occasionally of brutes. Hence, generally, the life of the individual. In the further development of the idea it becomes, instead of the body, the seat of the will, dispositions, desires, passions; and, combined with the &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; body, denotes the constituent parts of humanity. Hence the morally endowed individuality of man which continues after death.<p>Scripture. In the Old Testament, answering to nephesh, primarily life, breath; therefore life in its distinct individuality; life as such, distinguished from other men and from inanimate nature. Not the principle of life, but that which bears in itself and manifests the life-principle. Hence spirit (ruach, &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;) in the Old Testament never signifies the individual. Soul (&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;), of itself, does not constitute personality, but only when it is the soul of a human being. Human personality is derived from spirit (&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;), and finds expression in soul or life (&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;).<p>The New-Testament usage follows the Old, in denoting all individuals from the point of view of individual life. Thus the phrase &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; every soul, i.e., every person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-9.htm">Romans 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>), marking them off from inanimate nature. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-3.htm">Romans 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-4.htm">Romans 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-15.htm">2 Corinthians 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, illustrate an Old-Testament usage whereby the soul is the seat of personality, and is employed instead of the personal pronoun, with a collateral notion of value as individual personality.<p>These and other passages are opposed to the view which limits the term to a mere animal life-principle. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>; the compounds &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; with one soul; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; like-minded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20</a>), where personal interest and accord of feeling are indicated, and not lower elements of personality.
