In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-32.htm" title="And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.">Exodus 8:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm" title="And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.">Exodus 9:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that opens the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.">Exodus 13:15</a>, &c., the hardening of Pharaoh’s heart is attributed to his own act. That act may, however, be regarded as a part of the design of Providence. God’s decrees include human free-will, without destroying it. But <span class= "ital">how</span> they do this we cannot say.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:14-24 Whatever God does, must be just. Wherein the holy, happy people of God differ from others, God's grace alone makes them differ. In this preventing, effectual, distinguishing grace, he acts as a benefactor, whose grace is his own. None have deserved it; so that those who are saved, must thank God only; and those who perish, must blame themselves only, Hos 13:9. God is bound no further than he has been pleased to bind himself by his own covenant and promise, which is his revealed will. And this is, that he will receive, and not cast out, those that come to Christ; but the drawing of souls in order to that coming, is an anticipating, distinguishing favour to whom he will. Why does he yet find fault? This is not an objection to be made by the creature against his Creator, by man against God. The truth, as it is in Jesus, abases man as nothing, as less than nothing, and advances God as sovereign Lord of all. Who art thou that art so foolish, so feeble, so unable to judge the Divine counsels? It becomes us to submit to him, not to reply against him. Would not men allow the infinite God the same sovereign right to manage the affairs of the creation, as the potter exercises in disposing of his clay, when of the same lump he makes one vessel to a more honourable, and one to a meaner use? God could do no wrong, however it might appear to men. God will make it appear that he hates sin. Also, he formed vessels filled with mercy. Sanctification is the preparation of the soul for glory. This is God's work. Sinners fit themselves for hell, but it is God who prepares saints for heaven; and all whom God designs for heaven hereafter, he fits for heaven now. Would we know who these vessels of mercy are? Those whom God has called; and these not of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles. Surely there can be no unrighteousness in any of these Divine dispensations. Nor in God's exercising long-suffering, patience, and forbearance towards sinners under increasing guilt, before he brings utter destruction upon them. The fault is in the hardened sinner himself. As to all who love and fear God, however such truths appear beyond their reason to fathom, yet they should keep silence before him. It is the Lord alone who made us to differ; we should adore his pardoning mercy and new-creating grace, and give diligence to make our calling and election sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore hath he mercy ... - This is a conclusion stated by the apostle as the result of all the argument.<p>Whom he will he hardeneth - This is not stated in what the Scripture said to Pharaoh, but is a conclusion to which the apostle had arrived, in view of the case of Pharaoh. The word "hardeneth" means only to harden in the manner specified in the case of Pharaoh. It does not mean to exert a positive influence, but to leave a sinner to his own course, and to place him in circumstances where the character will be more and more developed; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>. It implies, however, an act of sovereignty on the part of God in thus leaving him to his chosen course, and in not putting forth that influence by which he could be saved from death. Why this is, the apostle does not state. We should, however, not dispute a fact everywhere prevalent; and should have sufficient confidence in God to believe that it is in accordance with infinite wisdom and rectitude. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

The result then is that He hath<p>mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth&#8212;by judicially abandoning them to the hardening influence of sin itself (Ps 81:11, 12; Ro 1:24, 26, 28; Heb 3:8, 13), and of the surrounding incentives to it (Mt 24:12; 1Co 15:38; 2Th 2:17).<p>Second objection to the doctrine of Divine Sovereignty:<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse is a short repetition of the foregoing argument. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-15.htm" title="For he said to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.">Romans 9:15</a></span>, and the notes there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And whom he will he hardeneth; </span> i.e. in a judicial way. Besides natural hardness, which is in all men, and is hereditary to them; and habitual hardness, which is contracted by a custom in sin, as a path is hardened by the continual trampling of passengers; there is judicial or judiciary hardness, which is inflicted by God as a punishment. Men harden their own hearts sinfully, (so it is thrice said of Pharaoh in Exodus, that he hardened his own heart, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm" title="But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:15</a>,32 9:34</span>), and then God hardens their hearts judicially: so it is often said of God in Exodus, that he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-13.htm" title="And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 7:13</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-12.htm" title="And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had spoken to Moses.">Exodus 9:12</a> 10:1,20,27 14:8</span>. God is not said properly to harden the hearts of men; i.e. he doth not make their soft hearts hard, nor doth he put hardness into the hearts of men, (as our adversaries slanderously report us to affirm), nor doth he barely permit or suffer them to be hardened (which is the opinion of the papists about this matter); but two ways may he be said to harden sinners: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. By forsaking them, and not softening their hearts: as darkness follows upon the sun’s withdrawing of his light, so doth hardness upon God’s withholding his softening influence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. By punishing them; he inflicts further hardness, as a punishment of former hardness; and this he infuseth not, but it is effected either: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a) By Satan, to whom hardened sinners are delivered up; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>b) By themselves, they being given over to their own hearts’ lusts; or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>c) By God’s word and works, which accidentally harden the hearts of men, as might be shown. <span class="ital">{see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-19.htm" title="You will say then to me, Why does he yet find fault?

These are the express words of the former testimony: it follows, <p>and whom he will he hardeneth; which is the just and natural consequence of what is contained in the latter; for if God could, or he did, without any injustice, raise up Pharaoh, and harden his heart against him and his people, that he might rise up against him and destroy him by his power for his own glory, then he may harden any other person, and even whom he will: now this hardening of men's hearts may be understood in perfect agreement with the justice and holiness of God: men first harden their own hearts by sinning, as Pharaoh did; what God does, is by leaving them to the hardness of their hearts, denying them that grace which only can soften them, and which he is not obliged to give, and therefore does them no injustice in withholding it from them; by sending them both mercies and judgments, which through the corruption of their hearts, are the means of the greater hardening of them; so judgments in the case of Pharaoh, and mercies in the case of others; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>; by delivering them up into the hands of Satan, and to their own lusts, which they themselves approve of; and by giving them up to a judicial blindness and hardness of heart, as a just punishment for their impieties. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{15}</span> Therefore hath he mercy on whom he <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> will <i>have mercy</i>, and whom he will he hardeneth.</span><p>(15) A conclusion of the full answer to the first objection: therefore seeing that God does not save those whom he freely chose according to his good will and pleasure, but by justifying and sanctifying them by his grace, his counsels in saving them cannot seem unjust. And again, there is not injustice in the everlasting counsel of God, with regard to the destruction of those whom he lifts to destroy, because he hardens before he destroys: therefore the third answer for the maintenance of God's justice in the everlasting counsel of reprobation, consists in this word hardening: which nonetheless he concealed in the former verse, because the history of Pharaoh was well known. But the force of the word is great, for hardening, which is set against mercy, presupposes the same things that mercy did, that is, a voluntary corruption, in which the reprobate are hardened: and again, corruption presupposes a perfect state of creation. Moreover, this hardening also is voluntary, for God hardens in such a way, being offended with corruption, that he uses their own will whom he hardens, for the executing of that judgment. Then follow the fruits of hardening, that is, unbelief and sin, which are the true and proper causes of the condemnation of the reprobate. Why does he then appoint to destruction? Because he wishes: why does he harden? Because they are corrupt: why does he condemn? Because they are sinners. Where then is unrighteousness? Nay, if he would destroy all after this manner, to whom would he do injury?<p>(t) Whom it pleased him to appoint, to show his favour upon.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-18.htm" title="Therefore has he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens.">Romans 9:18</a>.

Evidence to the same effect is supplied by the <span class="ital">twofold</span> representation given of the hardening of Pharaoh in Exodus, where it appears partly as <span class="ital">self-produced</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm" title="But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-32.htm" title="And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.">Exodus 8:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm" title="And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.">Exodus 9:34</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-6.htm" title="Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had worked wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?">1 Samuel 6:6</a>), partly as <span class="ital">effected by God</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-21.htm" title="And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.">Romans 4:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-3.htm" title="So then if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.">Romans 7:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-12.htm" title="It was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger.">Romans 9:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-20.htm" title="But Esaias is very bold, and said, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not after me....">Romans 10:20-21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-10.htm" title="Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always.">Romans 11:10</a>). Of these two ways of regarding the matter, however, Paul, suitably to his object, has expressly adopted the latter; Pharaoh <span class="ital">hardened by God</span> is to him the type of all who obstinately withstand the divine counsel of salvation, as Israel does. In opposition to Beck’s evasive expedients, see Lamping. On the <span class="ital">hardening itself</span> Olshausen remarks:—(1) That it presupposes already the beginnings of evil. But this is at variance with <span class="greekheb">ὃν θέλει</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ φυράματος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-21.htm" title="Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?">Romans 9:21</a>. (2) That it is not an aggravation of sin, but a means of preventing its aggravation. But Pharaoh’s history is against this. (3) That the total hardening is an expression of simple penal justice, when sin has become sin against the Holy Ghost. But in that case there could be no mention of a <span class="greekheb">ὃν θέλει</span>. The clear and simple sense of the apostle is, that it depends on the free determination of God’s will whether to bless with His saving mercy, or, on the other hand, to put into that spiritual condition, in which a man can be no object of His saving mercy (but rather of His <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span> only). Accordingly, the will of God is here the <span class="ital">absolute</span> will, which is only in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΛΕΕῖ</span></span></span> a will of grace, and not also in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΚΛΗΡΎΝΕΙ</span></span></span> (in opposition to Th. Schott). Of the style and manner in which the older dogmatic interpreters have here introduced qualifying clauses in the interests of opposition to absolute predestination, the development of the matter by Calovius may serve as an example. He maintains, that when it is said that God hardens, this is not to be taken <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝΕΡΓΗΤΙΚῶς</span></span></span> or <span class="ital">effective</span>, but (1) <span class="greekheb">συγχωρητικῶς</span>, propter <span class="ital">permissionem</span>; (2) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΦΟΡΜΗΤΙΚῶς</span></span></span>, propter <span class="ital">occasionem</span>, quam ex iis, quae Deus agit, sumunt reprobi; (3) <span class="greekheb">ἐγκαταλειπτικῶς</span>, ob <span class="ital">desertionem</span>, quod gratia sua deserat reprobos; (4) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΑΔΟΤΙΚῶς</span></span></span>, ob traditionem in sensum reprobum et in ulteriorem Satanae potestatem. But Philippi’s suggestion of the immanent <span class="ital">law</span> which the divine freedom carries within itself,—according to which God will have mercy upon <span class="ital">him</span> who acknowledges His right to have mercy on whom He will, and to harden whom He will; and will harden <span class="ital">him</span> who denies to Him this right,—will only then come into consideration by the side of what Paul here says, when (see remarks after <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a>) we are in a position to judge of the relation of our passage and the connection that follows it to the moral self-determination of man, which the apostle teaches <span class="ital">elsewhere;</span> seeing that no further guiding hint is here given by Paul, and, moreover, that immanent law of the divine freedom, as Philippi himself frankly recognises, is <span class="ital">not at all here</span> expressed. For now the apostle has been most sedulously and exclusively urging nothing but the complete independence of the divine willing in <span class="greekheb">ἐλεεῖν</span> and <span class="greekheb">σκληρύνειν</span>, which the <span class="ital">Form. Conc</span>. p. 821 does not duly attend to, when it maintains that Paul desired to represent the hardening of Pharaoh as an example of divine <span class="ital">penal justice</span>. Not “ut eo ipso Dei <span class="ital">justitiam</span> declararet,” has Paul adduced this example, although it falls <span class="ital">historically</span> under this point of view, but as a proof of the completely <span class="ital">free self-determination</span> of God to harden <span class="ital">whom He will</span>. Accordingly, the hardening here appears by no means, as has been lately read between the lines, “<span class="ital">as a consequence of preceding conceited self-righteousness</span>” (Tholuck), or “<span class="ital">such as the man himself has willed it</span>” (Th. Schott), or conditioned by the divine standard of holiness confronting human sin (Weiss), or with an obvious presupposition of human self-determination (Beyschlag). Elsewhere the hardening may be adjudged as a <span class="ital">punishment</span> by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm" title="And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not.">Isaiah 6:9</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-28.htm" title="Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.">Psalm 69:28</a>; see Umbreit, p. 310 f.), but not so here. The will of God, which in truth can be no arbitrary pleasure, is no doubt holy and just; but it is not here apprehended and set forth under this <span class="ital">point of view</span> and from this <span class="ital">side</span>, but in reference to its <span class="ital">independence of all human assistance</span>, consequently in accordance with its <span class="ital">alsolute aseitas</span>, which is to be retained in its clear precision and without any qualifying clause to the words <span class="greekheb">ὃν θέλει ἐλεεῖ</span>, and must not be obscured by ideas of mediate agency that are here foreign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-18.htm" title="Therefore has he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardens.">Romans 9:18</a>. From the two instances just quoted Paul draws the comprehensive conclusion: So then on whom He will He has mercy, and whom He will He hardens. The whole emphasis is on <span class="greekheb">θέλει</span>. The two modes in which God acts upon man are showing mercy and hardening, and it depends upon God’s will in which of these two modes He actually does act. The word <span class="greekheb">σκληρύνει</span> is borrowed from the history of Pharaoh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm" title="And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-22.htm" title="And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he listen to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm" title="Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-12.htm" title="And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had spoken to Moses.">Exodus 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-17.htm" title="And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.">Exodus 14:17</a>. What precisely the hardening means, and in what relation God’s hardening of Pharaoh’s heart stood to Pharaoh’s own hardening of it against God, are not unimportant questions, but they are questions which Paul does not here raise. He has one aim always in view here—to show that man has no claim as of right against God; and he finds a decisive proof of this (at least for a Jew) in the opposite examples of Moses and Pharaoh, interpreted as these are by unmistakable words of God Himself. It was through God, in the last resort, that Moses and Pharaoh were what they were, signal instances of the Divine mercy and the Divine wrath.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">whom he will</span>] The emphasis is of course on these words, in each clause: to us, the <span class="ital">only</span> account of the differences of His action is His Will. The following verses prove beyond fair question that St Paul means fully to enforce this truth, intensely <span class="ital">trying</span> as it is to the human heart. He lays it down without mitigation or counterpoise: not that there is <span class="ital">no</span> mitigation; but mitigation is far from his purpose here.—The deepest relief to thought in the matter is just this, that this sovereign and unaccountable will is His Will; the Will of the living God, the Father of our Lord. But it is none the less <span class="ital">sovereign;</span> and that is the point here.—Observe that the Gr. pronoun rendered “<span class="ital">whom</span>” throughout this verse is <span class="ital">singular</span>.

Moreover, as regards the question, to whom God wills to show mercy, and whom He wills to harden; Paul shows that in other passages.—<span class="greekheb">ἐλεεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">has mercy</span>) as for example on Moses.—<span class="greekheb">σκληρύνει</span>, <span class="ital">hardens</span>) as He did Pharaoh. He uses, <span class="ital">hardens</span>, for, <span class="ital">has not mercy</span>, by metonymy of [substituting, for the antecedent,] the consequent, although <span class="ital">not to have mercy</span> has a somewhat harsher meaning: so, <span class="ital">is sanctified</span>, for, <span class="ital">is not unclean</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.">1 Corinthians 7:14</a>; and, <span class="ital">you rescued from</span>, [<span class="greekheb">ἐῤῥύσασθε</span>], instead of <span class="ital">you did not deliver up</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-31.htm" title="And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now you have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD.">Joshua 22:31</a>.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He will (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>In a decretory sense.

See on hard, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-24.htm">Matthew 25:24</a>; see on Jde 1:14; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-4.htm">James 3:4</a>. Three words are used in the Hebrew to describe the hardening of Pharaoh's heart. The one which occurs most frequently, properly means to be strong, and therefore represents the hardness as foolhardiness, infatuated insensibility to danger. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>. The word is used in its positive sense, hardens, not merely permits to become hard. In Exodus the hardening is represented as self-produced (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-32.htm">Exodus 8:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34</a>), and as produced by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-12.htm">Exodus 9:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-20.htm">Exodus 10:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-27.htm">Exodus 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-10.htm">Exodus 11:10</a>). Paul here chooses the latter representation. </body></html>
