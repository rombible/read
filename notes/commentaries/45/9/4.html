The apostle, with great address, enumerates these privileges of the Jews, both that he might show how honourably he thought of them, and that he might awaken their solicitude, not to sacrifice that divine favour, by which they had been so eminently and so long distinguished. <span class="ital">To whom pertaineth the adoption — </span>That is whom God hath taken into a special covenant with himself, whereby he stands engaged ever to act the part of a God and Father to them, and to own them for his children. It is true, this adoption of the Jews was but a shadow of the heavenly adoption of believers in Christ; yet was it, simply considered, a prerogative of a very sacred import. <span class="ital">And the glory</span> — The visible symbol of the divine presence which rested above the ark, was called <span class="ital">the glory, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-21.htm" title="And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.">1 Samuel 4:21</a>, and <span class="ital">the glory of the Lord. </span>Hence the introduction of the ark into the temple, is called <span class="ital">the entrance of the King of glory, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-7.htm" title="Lift up your heads, O you gates; and be you lift up, you everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.">Psalm 24:7</a>; and upon the carrying away of the ark by the Philistines, the wife of Phineas, now at the point of death, said, <span class="ital">The glory is departed from Israel. </span>But God himself was the glory of his people Israel, and by many visible testimonies of his presence with them, shed a glory upon them, and caused their brightness to shine throughout the world. So Isaiah, <span class="ital">The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory. </span>These two last-mentioned particulars are relative to each other: Israel is the firstborn son of God, and the God of glory is his God. <span class="ital">And the covenants </span>— That with Abraham, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-8.htm" title="And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?">Genesis 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-2.htm" title="And I will make my covenant between me and you, and will multiply you exceedingly.">Genesis 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-7.htm" title="And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God to you, and to your seed after you.">Genesis 17:7</a>; and that with the Jewish nation by the ministry of Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/24-7.htm" title="And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD has said will we do, and be obedient....">Exodus 24:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-27.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write you these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.">Exodus 34:27</a>; including the seals of these covenants, namely, circumcision, the seal of the former, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-10.htm" title="This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me and you and your seed after you; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.">Genesis 17:10</a>; and the sprinkling of blood the seal of the latter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm" title="And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.">Exodus 24:8</a>. He says <span class="ital">covenants, </span>in the plural, also, because God’s covenant with his people was often and variously repeated. And <span class="ital">the giving of the law </span>— The glorious promulgation of the moral law by God himself, by the mediation of his angels upon mount Horeb; not excluding the more private delivery of the various judicial and political laws appointed for the government of that commonwealth. The covenant, in the first dispensation of it, was given long before the law. <span class="ital">And the worship of God </span>— The way of worshipping God according to his will, prescribed in the ceremonial law for the people, till Christ should come in the flesh: <span class="ital">and the promises </span>— Of the Messiah, and of spiritual and eternal blessings by him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By enumerating these privileges of the Jews, the apostle, as above observed, not only meant to show them that he respected them on account of these advantages, but to make them sensible of the loss they were about to sustain by God’s casting them off. “They were to be excluded from the better privileges of the gospel church, of which their ancient privileges were but the types. For their relation to God as his people, signified by the name <span class="ital">Israelites, </span>prefigured the more honourable relation which believers, the true Israel, stand in to God. Their adoption as the sons of God, and the privileges they were entitled to thereby, were types of believers being made partakers of the divine nature by the renewing of the Holy Ghost, and of their title to the inheritance of heaven. The residence of the glory, first in the tabernacle and then in the temple, was a figure of the residence of God, by his Spirit, in the Christian Church, his temple on earth, and of his eternal residence in that church, brought to its perfect form in heaven. The <span class="ital">covenant with Abraham </span>was the new, or gospel covenant, the blessings of which were typified by the temporal blessings promised to him and to his natural seed: and the <span class="ital">covenant of Sinai, </span>whereby the Israelites, as the worshippers of the true God, were separated from the idolatrous nations, was an emblem of the final separation of the righteous from the wicked for ever. In the <span class="ital">giving of the law, </span>and the formation of the Israelites into a nation, or community, the formation of the city of the living God, and of the general assembly and church of the firstborn, was represented. Lastly, the heavenly country, the habitation of the righteous, was typified <span class="ital">by Canaan, </span>a country given to the Israelites by God’s promise.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-5 Being about to discuss the rejection of the Jews and the calling of the Gentiles, and to show that the whole agrees with the sovereign electing love of God, the apostle expresses strongly his affection for his people. He solemnly appeals to Christ; and his conscience, enlightened and directed by the Holy Spirit, bore witness to his sincerity. He would submit to be treated as accursed, to be disgraced, crucified; and even for a time be in the deepest horror and distress; if he could rescue his nation from the destruction about to come upon them for their obstinate unbelief. To be insensible to the eternal condition of our fellow-creatures, is contrary both to the love required by the law, and the mercy of the gospel. They had long been professed worshippers of Jehovah. The law, and the national covenant which was grounded thereon, belonged to them. The temple worship was typical of salvation by the Messiah, and the means of communion with God. All the promises concerning Christ and his salvation were given to them. He is not only over all, as Mediator, but he is God blessed for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who are Israelites - Descended from Israel, or Jacob; honored by having such an ancestor, and by bearing a name so distinguished as that of his descendants.

The greatness of its ancestry ennobled Israel, and made its position in Paul’s time harder to understand and to endure. Who could think without the keenest pain of the sons of such fathers forfeiting everything for which the fathers had been called? But the supreme distinction of Israel has yet to be mentioned. <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ὧν ὁ Χριστὸς τὸ κατὰ σάρκα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν ἐπὶ πάντων θεὸς εὐλογητὸς εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀμήν</span>. The only point in the interpretation of this verse, in which it can be said that interpreters are wholly at one, is the statement that of Israel the Messiah came, according to the flesh. The words <span class="greekheb">τὸ κατὰ σάρκα</span> define the extent to which the Messiah can be explained by His descent from Israel; for anything going beyond <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>, or ordinary humanity, the explanation must be sought elsewhere. The limitation suggests an antithesis, and one in which the spiritual or Divine side of the Messiah’s nature should find expression, this being the natural counterpart of <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>: and such an antithesis has been sought and found in the words which follow. He who, according to the flesh, is of Israel, is at the same time over all, God blessed for ever. This interpretation, which refers the whole of the words after <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ὧν</span> to <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστὸς</span>, is adopted by many of the best scholars: Gifford, Sanday, Westcott (see <span class="ital">N.T.</span>, vol. ii., app., p. 110), Weiss, etc., and has much in its favour. (1) It <span class="ital">does</span> supply the complementary antithesis which <span class="greekheb">τὸ κατὰ σάρκα</span> suggests. (2) Grammatically it is simple, for <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν</span> naturally applies to what precedes: the person who is over all is naturally the person just mentioned, unless there is decisive reason to the contrary. (3) If we adopt another punctuation, and make the words <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν ἐπὶ πάντων θεὸς εὐλογητὸς εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας</span> a doxology—“God Who is over all be blessed for ever”—there are grammatical objections. These are (<span class="ital">a</span>) the use of <span class="greekheb">ὤν</span>, which is at least abnormal. “God Who is over all” would naturally be expressed by <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐπὶ πάντων θεὸς</span> without <span class="greekheb">ὤν</span>: the <span class="greekheb">ὢν</span> suggests the reference to Christ. (<span class="ital">b</span>) The position of <span class="greekheb">εὐλογητὸς</span> is unparalleled in a doxology; it ought, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:">Ephesians 1:3</a> and the LXX., to stand first in the sentence. But these reasons are not decisive. As for (1), though a complementary antithesis to <span class="greekheb">τὸ κατὰ σάρκα</span> is suggested, it is not imperatively demanded here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a> f. The greatness reflected upon Israel by the origin of the person in question is sufficiently conveyed by <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span>, without any expansion. As for (2), it is true to say that <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν</span> naturally refers to what precedes: the only question is, whether the natural reference may not in any given case be precluded. Many scholars think it is precluded here. Meyer, for instance, argues that “Paul has <span class="ital">never</span> used the express <span class="greekheb">θεὸς</span> of Christ, since he has not adopted, like John, the Alexandrian form of conceiving and setting forth the Divine essence of Christ, but has adhered to the popular concrete, strictly monotheistic terminology, not modified by philosophical speculation even for the designation of Christ; and he always accurately distinguishes God and Christ”. To this he adds the more dubious reasons that in the genuine apostolic writings (he excludes <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm" title="And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">2 Timothy 4:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-18.htm" title="But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.">2 Peter 3:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-21.htm" title="Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.">Hebrews 13:21</a>, and Rev.) there is no doxology to Christ in the form usual in doxologies referring to God, and that by <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ πάντων</span> the Son’s subordination is denied. To these last arguments it may be answered that if the words in question do apply to Christ they are not a doxology at all (Gifford), but a declaration of deity, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for ever more, knows that I lie not.">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>, and that Christ’s subordination is not affected by His being described as <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὢν ἐπὶ πάντων</span> any more than by His own claim to have all authority in heaven and on earth. But the first of Meyer’s arguments has a weight which it is impossible not to feel, and it becomes the more decisive the more we realise Paul’s whole habit of thought and speech. To say with Dr. Gifford, “When we review the history of the interpretation it cannot but be regarded as a remarkable fact that every objection urged against the ancient interpretation rests ultimately on dogmatic presuppositions,” hardly covers such a position as Meyer represents. For the “dogmatic presuppositions” are not arbitrary, but merely sum up the whole impression made. on the mind by the study of Paul’s writings, an impression by which we cannot but be influenced, especially in deciding delicate and dubious questions like this. If we ask ourselves point blank, whether Paul, as we know his mind from his epistles, would express his sense of Christ’s greatness by calling Him God blessed for ever, it seems to me almost impossible to answer in the affirmative. Such an assertion is not on the same plane with the conception of Christ which meets us everywhere in the Apostle’s writings; and though there is some irregularity in the grammar, and perhaps some difficulty in seeing the point of a doxology, I agree with those who would put a colon or a period at <span class="greekheb">σάρκα</span>, and make the words that follow refer not to Christ but to the Father. This is the punctuation given in the margin by W. and H., and “alone seems adequate to account for the whole of the language employed, more especially when considered in relation to the context” (Hort, <span class="ital">N.T</span>., vol. ii., app., p. 110). The doxology is, indeed, somewhat hard to comprehend; it seems at the first glance without a motive, and no psychological explanation of it yet offered is very satisfying. It is as if Paul, having carried the privileges of Israel to a climax by mentioning the origin of the Messiah as far as regards His humanity, suddenly felt himself face to face with the problem of the time, how to reconcile these extraordinary privileges with the rejection of the Jews; and before addressing himself to any study or solution of it expressed in this way his devout and adoring faith, even under the pressure of such a perplexity, in the sovereign providence of God. The use of <span class="greekheb">ὢν</span>, which is in itself unnecessary, emphasises <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ πάντων</span>; and this emphasis is “fully justified if St. Paul’s purpose is to suggest that the tragic apostasy of the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-2.htm" title="That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart....">Romans 9:2-3</a>) is itself part of the dispensations of Him Who is God over all, over Jew and Gentile alike, over past, present and future alike; so that the ascription of blessing to Him is a homage to His Divine purpose and power of bringing good out of evil in the course of the ages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-13.htm" title="For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:...">Romans 11:13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in....">Romans 11:25-36</a>)”: W. and H., ii., app., p. 110. Full discussions of the passage are given in Meyer, S. and H., and Gifford; also by Dr. Ezra Abbot in the <span class="ital">Journal of the Society of Biblical Exegesis</span>, 1883. With this preface Paul proceeds to justify the ways of God to men: see the introductory remarks above. The first section of his argument (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-6.htm" title="Not as though the word of God has taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:...">Romans 9:6-29</a>) is in the narrower sense a theodicy—a vindication of God’s right in dealing as He has dealt with Israel. In the first part of this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/9-6.htm" title="Not as though the word of God has taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel:...">Romans 9:6-13</a>) he shows that the rejection of the mass of Israel from the Messianic Kingdom involves no breach or failure of the Divine promise.

It is, of course, a different idea from that of the spiritual <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of believers (at present as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, or to come as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>), though it might be typical of it. "The glory" (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>) seems best explained by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7-18</a>, where the visible glory, said to have rested on the mercy-seat and to have illuminated for a time the face of Moses, is regarded as expressing the glory, in a higher sense, of the old dispensation, which, however, was destined to fade away in the greater glory of the revelation of God in Christ. The word may be thus taken to denote, not simply the <span class="accented">Sheehinab</span>, or the glory on Mount Sinai, but rather what was signified by these manifestations. It was probably a recognized term in use with reference to the giving of the Law. "The covenants" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and "the promises" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), both in the plural, include those made with and given to Abraham and the other patriarchs, as well as the Mosaic ones. The former word is wrongly taken by some as denoting the <span class="accented">tables</span> of the covenant. <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is obviously the divinely appointed ceremonial worship, the typical significance of which is explained at length in the Epistle to the Hebrews, where the same word is used. "The fathers" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) are the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the original recipients of the promises, descent from whom was made such account of by the Jews, as being the foundation of their privileges (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-8.htm">Luke 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>; and, for the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in this sense, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>). The last and crowning distinction of the Jewish race is mentioned last, viz. the fleshly descent therefrom of Christ, even of him who in his higher nature is "over all, God blessed for ever." This is certainly the most obvious meaning of the conclusion of ver. 5, as far as the language is concerned, and the one understood by all ancient commentators. Some moderns, however, as is well known, have raised objections to this interpretation of the clause, based solely on the supposed improbability that St. Paul would have so designated Christ. Some would, therefore, get over this imagined difficulty by putting a full stop after <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>, and taking what follows as a doxology to God the Father, thus: "God, who is over all, be blessed for ever." The apostle is supposed, according to this interpretation, to have been moved to this parenthetical utterance by his contemplation of the Divine favours to Israel, which he had been recounting. Some have suggested the full stop being put after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, so as to refer <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>  to Christ, and take only what follows as a doxology, or, as some would have it, as a statement. But, in either case, the idea of so unlikely a breaking up of the sentence may be dismissed as untenable. Others, without thus breaking up the sentence, take the whole of it, beginning with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>, to be, not a doxology, but a statement, thus at- tempting to meet the objection to its being a doxology (to be noticed presently), arising from the collocation of the words. But a mere assertion that God <span class="accented">is</span> blessed for ever would seem peculiarly uncalled for and purposeless here. Meyer, being a critic of deserved repute, and an upholder of the modern interpretation of the clause, taking the whole of it together as a doxology to the Father, it may suffice to state his arguments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That St. Paul, though regarding the Son of God as the image of God, of the essence of God, the agent in creation and preservation, the judge of all, the object of prayer, and the possessor of Divine glory and fulness of grace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12</a>; Philippians it. 6; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, etc.; Colossians 2:9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>), never expressly calls him <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, but always clearly distinguishes him as the <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> from <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; and that the passages in which <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> has been supposed by some to apply to him (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>) are wrongly so understood; <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, being also undoubtedly the original reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>.

Meyer adds in a note, "<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a> certainly refers to Christ; but this is just one of the traces of post-apostolic composition. Now, to these arguments it may be replied as follows: To (1) that, though it may be true that St. Paul in no other passage expressly calls Christ <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, yet his doctrine with respect to his Divine nature is in accordance with the expression; for surely the term <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is applicable to him who is spoken of, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, etc.; that his usual distinction between the supreme God and Christ as Mediator by no means precludes his declaring in express terms Christ's essential Deity in a passage where such a declaration is suitable and called for; that even St. John, who is acknowledged by all to have peculiarly set forth the Divine essence of Christ, only once uses the expression, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or any exactly equivalent to it. To argument (2) it may be replied that the language used does <span class="accented">not</span> identify Christ with the Father as <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, especially if we suppose a comma after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, so that the meaning would he, "Christ who is over all, God blessed for ever." That Christ is "over all" is what is distinctly declared elsewhere by St. Paul, and <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., may be appended predicatively to denote his Divine essence. As to argument (3), it is necessary to exclude not only 2 Peter and Hebrews, but also 2 Timothy from the list of apostolical writings in order to give it any force. But even so it would be irrelevant; for the sentence before us is not a doxology, but an assertion: it is, according to the ancient interpretation, not "Blessed <span class="accented">be</span> Christ as God for ever;" but" Christ, who is God blessed for ever." The positive reasons for retaining the ancient interpretations may be stated as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Not one of the Greek or other Fathers, or any interpreter before Erasmus, is known to have understood it otherwise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It gives the most obvious sense of the words themselves. It may well be contended that no other would have been thought of, but for the supposed discrepance with the apostle's usual way of speaking of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Whereas a doxology to God the Father does not seem called for here, or to have any very obvious bearing on the writer's train of thought, some assertion of the Divine greatness of Christ seems wanted to complete the representation of the final and crowning privilege of the race of Israel. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would indeed suffice for this purpose, if it could be dissevered from what follows. But, as has been said above, it is not allowable so to break up the sentence. Cf also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, where the statement that Christ had been born of the seed of David, <span class="accented">according to the flesh</span>, is followed by an assertion also of his Divine Sonship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> If the sentence had been intended as a doxology, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> ought properly to have preceded <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>, where the same expression occurs); whereas in every other passage where <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> follows the subject of the sentence, it is an assertion, and not a doxology (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The whole objection to the ancient interpretation rests solely on the views of modern critics as to what they think St. Paul was <span class="accented">likely</span> to mean - not on what his language most obviously intimates that he <span class="accented">did</span> mean - a very unsafe principle of interpretation. Our safe conclusion seems to be that modern criticism has not made out a sufficient case for departing from the unanimous ancient interpretation of this passage. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Who (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>The double relative characterizes the Israelites with their call and privileges as such that for them he could even wish himself accursed.<p>Israelites<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>.<p>Adoption<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>.
