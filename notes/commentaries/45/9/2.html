He solemnly appeals to Christ; and his conscience, enlightened and directed by the Holy Spirit, bore witness to his sincerity. He would submit to be treated as accursed, to be disgraced, crucified; and even for a time be in the deepest horror and distress; if he could rescue his nation from the destruction about to come upon them for their obstinate unbelief. To be insensible to the eternal condition of our fellow-creatures, is contrary both to the love required by the law, and the mercy of the gospel. They had long been professed worshippers of Jehovah. The law, and the national covenant which was grounded thereon, belonged to them. The temple worship was typical of salvation by the Messiah, and the means of communion with God. All the promises concerning Christ and his salvation were given to them. He is not only over all, as Mediator, but he is God blessed for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Great heaviness - Great grief.<p>Continual sorrow - The word rendered "continual" here must be taken in a popular sense. Not that he was literally all the time pressed down with this sorrow, but that whenever he thought on this subject, he had great grief; as we say of a painful subject, it is a source of constant pain. The cause of this grief, Paul does not expressly mention, though it is implied in what he immediately says. It was the fact that so large a part of the nation would be rejected, and cast off. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

By the greatness of it; it was such as a woman hath in travail so the word imports. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. By the continuance of it; it was <span class="ital">continual, </span> or without intermission. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. By the seat of it; it was in his <span class="ital">heart, </span> and not outward in his face. The cause he doth not here set down, but it is easily gathered from what follows, viz. the obstinacy and infidelity, together with the rejection, of the Jews. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. This is the thing he appeals to Christ for the truth of, and calls in his conscience and the Holy Ghost to bear witness to. These two words, "heaviness" and "sorrow", the one signifies grief, which had brought on heaviness on his spirits; and the other such pain as a woman in travail feels: and the trouble of his mind expressed by both, is described by its quantity, "great", it was not a little, but much; by its quality it was internal, it was in his "heart", it did not lie merely in outward show, in a few words or tears, but was in his heart, it was a heart sorrow; and by its duration, "continual", it was not a sudden emotion or passion, but what had been long in him, and had deeply affected and greatly depressed him: and what was the reason of all this? it is not expressed, but may pretty easily be understood; it was because of the obstinacy of his countrymen the Jews, the hardness of their hearts, and their wilful rejection of the Messiah; their trusting to their own righteousness, to the neglect and contempt of the righteousness of Christ, which he knew must unavoidably issue in their eternal destruction; also what greatly affected his mind was the utter rejection of them, as the people of God, and the judicial blindness, and hardness of heart, he full well knew was coming upon them, and which he was about to break unto them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-2.htm" title="That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.">Romans 9:2</a>.

The heart is capable of a vast complexity of emotions, and none the less so when it is “spiritual.” Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm" title="Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:">1 Peter 1:6</a>.—No doubt the expressions here are the more intense <span class="ital">because</span> of the contrasted recent view of the coming glory of believers, and their security in the love and covenant of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-2.htm" title="That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.">Romans 9:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Λύπη</span>, <span class="ital">grief</span>, [<span class="ital">heaviness</span>]) In spiritual things grief and (see the end of the eighth chapter) joy in the highest degree may exist together. Paul was sensible, from how great benefits, already enumerated, the Jews excluded themselves, and at the same time he declares [makes it evident], that he does not say those things, which he has to say, in an unfriendly spirit towards his persecutors.—<span class="greekheb">μοι</span>—<span class="greekheb">τῇ καρδίᾳ μου</span>, <span class="ital">to me—in my heart</span>) These are equivalent in each half of the verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart</span>. He does not say what for, leaving it to appear in what follows. The broken sentence is significant of emotion. <span class="cmt_word">For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh</span>. None of the ways that have been suggested for evading the obvious meaning of this assertion are tenable. One such way is to take the imperfect <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> as expressing what he once wished, viz. before his conversion; so that the meaning would be, "My interest in my own people is such that, in my zeal for them, I once myself desired to be entirely apart from Christ; I myself said, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>), and persecuted his followers." Neither the natural force of the imperfect here (as to which cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-22.htm">Acts 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-20.htm">Galatians 4:20</a>), nor that of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, nor the context, allow this subterfuge. Another way is to understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as implying only devotion to temporal destruction, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to a violent death. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>, every animal devoted to the Lord (in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) is surely to be put to death; and this has been conceived as all that is implied here. So Jerome, 'Quaest. 9, ad Algas.,' and Hilary, 'Ad <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>.' But how then about <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>? The words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, both denote primarily what is offered or set apart; the latter being applied to things devoted to God's honour and service (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-5.htm">Luke 21:5</a>), the latter always in the New Testament used to denote rejection or devotion to evil. It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-14.htm">Acts 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8, 9</a>. It certainly means here separation from the communion of Christ, in the same sense as <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>). Even if the expression <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> be understood as meaning in itself excommunication only (as <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> in ecclesiastical usage), the addition of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> evidently implies more than mere separation from outward Church communion. The apostle can hardly mean otherwise than that he would forfeit his own communion with Christ on behalf of (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>) his countrymen, if so they as a nation could be brought to accept the gospel. This certainly was a strong thing to say, and it may seem to us to imply an impossibility, if we compare it, for instance, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm">Romans 8:38</a>, "I am persuaded<span class="accented"></span>," etc. But we need not understand a passing expression of feeling, however real, as a deliberate utterance. The imperfect <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> implies only that the fact had passed through his mind in the intensity of his desire for the salvation of his brethren. It corresponds with the saying of Moses under the like strong emotion, "Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin -; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of the book which thou hast written" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>). Bengel remarks well," Ex summa fide (cap. 8) nunc summum ostendit amorem, ex amore divine accensum. Res non poterat fieri, quam optarat: sed votum erat pium et solidum, quamlibet cum tacita conditione, <span class="accented">si fieri posset."</span> Also, "De mensura amoris in Mose et Paulo non facile est existimare. Eum enim modulus ratiocinationum nostrarum non capit; sieur heroum bellicorum animos non capit parvulus." St. Paul proceeds, in the spirit of a patriotic Jew, which he ever retained, to enumerate the peculiar privileges of the chosen people, their possession of which rendered their present failure to realize their purpose so peculiarly disappointing and distressing. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Heaviness, sorrow (&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;)<p>Heaviness, so Wyc. and Tynd., in the earlier sense of sorrow.
