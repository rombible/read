The promises and threatenings shall be fulfilled. Grace does not run in the blood; nor are saving benefits always found with outward church privileges. Not only some of Abraham's seed were chosen, and others not, but God therein wrought according to the counsel of his own will. God foresaw both Esau and Jacob as born in sin, by nature children of wrath even as others. If left to themselves they would have continued in sin through life; but for wise and holy reasons, not made known to us, he purposed to change Jacob's heart, and to leave Esau to his perverseness. This instance of Esau and Jacob throws light upon the Divine conduct to the fallen race of man. The whole Scripture shows the difference between the professed Christian and the real believer. Outward privileges are bestowed on many who are not the children of God. There is, however, full encouragement to diligent use of the means of grace which God has appointed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As it is written - <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2-3</a>. That is, the distribution of favors is on the principle advanced by the prophet, and is in accordance with the declaration that God had in fact loved the one and hated the other.<p>Jacob - This refers, doubtless, to the posterity of Jacob.<p>Have I loved - I have shown affection for that people; I have bestowed on them great privileges and blessings, as proofs of attachment. I have preferred Jacob to Esau.<p>Esau - The descendants of Esau, the Edomites; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-4.htm">Malachi 1:4</a>.<p>Have I hated - This does not mean any positive hatred; but that he had preferred Jacob, and had withheld from Esau those privileges and blessings which he had conferred on the posterity of Jacob. This is explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>," And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness;" compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-6.htm">Ezekiel 35:6</a>. It was common among the Hebrews to use the terms "love" and "hatred" in this comparative sense, where the former implied strong positive attachment, and the latter, not positive hatred, but merely a less love, or the withholding of the expressions of affection; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-30.htm">Genesis 29:30-31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>, "He that spareth his rod hateth his son; but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>, "No man can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other," etc.; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>, "if any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, etc." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-13. And not only this; but when Rebecca, &c.&#8212;It might be thought that there was a natural reason for preferring the child of Sarah, as being Abraham's true and first wife, both to the child of Hagar, Sarah's maid, and to the children of Keturah, his second wife. But there could be no such reason in the case of Rebecca, Isaac's only wife; for the choice of her son Jacob was the choice of one of two sons by the same mother and of the younger in preference to the elder, and before either of them was born, and consequently before either had done good or evil to be a ground of preference: and all to show that the sole ground of distinction lay in the unconditional choice of God&#8212;"not of works, but of Him that calleth."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The foregoing oracle is expounded by another, taken out of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-2.htm" title="I have loved you, said the LORD. Yet you say, Wherein have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? said the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,">Malachi 1:2</a>,3</span>; see the annotations there. Because the foregoing passage of Esau’s serving Jacob doth not seem so full and clear, to betoken the election of Jacob, and the rejection of Esau, in the purpose of God, therefore the apostle brings this place to explain the former; and proves that the service or subjection of Esau to Jacob, was accompanied with God’s eternal and undeserved love of the one, and his just and righteous hatred of the other. There are some, that by Esau and Jacob do understand their posterity, and not their persons; that say, the love and hatred of God, in the forecited text, doth only or chiefly respect temporal things; God loved Jacob, i.e. he gave him the Land of Promise; but hated Esau, i.e. he gave him a dry and barren country, and made his mountain waste: that by God’s hating Esau, is only meant he loved him less than Jacob, &c. Such should consider, that the scope of the apostle is to show, that some are the children of God, and of the promise, and not others; and they must not make him cite testimonies out of the Old Testament impertinently. Much is written <span class="ital">pro</span> and <span class="ital">con</span> upon this argument. But I remember, he that writes a commentary must not too far involve himself in controversy. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/romans/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As it is written,.... In <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2</a>; <p>Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. These words are explanative of the former; they are of like import, and the one interpret the other; and show, that the former are to be understood in a spiritual, and not in a temporal sense, and of the persons, and not the posterity of Jacob and Esau; for though Malachi prophesied long after Jacob and Esau were personally dead, yet the Lord in that prophecy manifestly directs the murmuring Jews to the personal regard he had had to Jacob and Esau, and which had continued in numberless instances to their respective posterities, in order to stop their mouths, and reprove their ingratitude; and though he speaks of the nation of the Edomites, and to the posterity of Israel, yet it is evident, that he has a respect to the persons of Jacob and Esau, from whence they sprung, when he says, "was not Esau Jacob's brother?" <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2</a>, now though an Edomite may be said to be brother to an Israelite, yet Esau is never said, nor can he with any propriety be said to be the brother of Jacob's posterity: it remains, that these words regard their persons, and express the true spring and source of the choice of the one, and the rejection of the other; and which holds true of all the instances of either kind: everlasting and unchangeable love is the true cause and spring of the choice of particular persons to eternal salvation; and hatred is the cause of rejection, by which is meant not positive hatred, which can only have for its object sin and sinners, or persons so considered; but negative hatred, which is God's will, not to give eternal life to some persons; and shows itself by a neglect of them, taking no notice of them, passing them by, when he chose others; so the word "hate" is used for neglect, taking no notice, where positive hatred cannot be thought to take place, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-13.htm" title="As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.">Romans 9:13</a>. “This utterance (<span class="greekheb">ἐῤῥέθη</span>) took place in conformity with the expressly testified (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/1-2.htm" title="I have loved you, said the LORD.

But just like Paul, so <span class="ital">the prophet himself</span> intends by <span class="greekheb">Ἰακώβ</span> and <span class="greekheb">Ἠσαῦ</span>, not the two <span class="ital">nations</span> Israel and Edom, but the <span class="ital">persons of the two brothers;</span> God <span class="ital">loved</span> the former, and <span class="ital">hated</span> the latter (and <span class="ital">therefore</span> has exalted Israel and destroyed Edom).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">aorists</span> are, in the sense <span class="ital">of the apostle</span>—as the relation of <span class="greekheb">καθὼς γέγρ</span>. to the preceding, imparting information respecting the subjective ground of the divine declaration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-12.htm" title="It was said to her, The elder shall serve the younger.">Romans 9:12</a>, shows—to be referred to the love and abhorrence entertained towards the brothers <span class="ital">before their birth</span>, but are not to be understood of the <span class="ital">de facto manifestation</span> of love and hatred by which the saying of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-23.htm" title="And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in your womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from your bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.">Genesis 25:23</a> had been in the result confirmed (van Hengel). <span class="greekheb">Ἐμίσησα</span>, moreover, is not to have a merely privative sense ascribed to it: <span class="ital">not to love</span>, or <span class="ital">to love less</span> (as Fessel, Glass, Grotius, Estius, and many, including Nösselt, Koppe, Tholuck, Flatt, Beck, Maier, Beyschlag), which is not admissible even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm" title="No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.

And as that love towards Jacob must be conceived of as completely independent of foreseen virtues (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-11.htm" title="(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calls;)">Romans 9:11</a>), so also this hatred towards Esau as completely independent of foreseen sins (in opposition to the Greek Fathers and Jerome on Malachi 1). Both were founded solely on the free elective determination of God; with whom, in the necessary connection of that plan which He had freely adopted for the process of theocratic development, the hatred and rejection of Esau were presupposed through their opposite, namely, the free love and election of Jacob to be the vehicle of the theocracy and its privileges, as the reverse side of this love and choice, which the history of Edom brought into actual relief.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">As it is written</span>] In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/malachi/1-2.htm" title="I have loved you, said the LORD.
