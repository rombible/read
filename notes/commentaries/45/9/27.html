It tends very much to the clearing of a truth, to observe how the Scripture is fulfilled in it. It is a wonder of Divine power and mercy that there are any saved: for even those left to be a seed, if God had dealt with them according to their sins, had perished with the rest. This great truth this Scripture teaches us. Even among the vast number of professing Christians it is to be feared that only a remnant will be saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Esaias - The Greek way of writing the word "Isaiah."<p>Crieth - <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22-23</a>. Exclaims, or speaks aloud or openly: compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm">John 1:15</a>. Isaiah brings forth the doctrine fully, and without any concealment or disguise. This doctrine related to the rejection of the Jews; a far more difficult point to establish than was that of the calling of the Gentiles. It was needful, therefore, to fortify it by some explicit passage of the Scriptures.<p>Concerning Israel - Concerning "the Jews." It is probable that Isaiah had reference primarily to the Jews of his own time; to that wicked generation that God was about to punish, by sending them captive into other lands. The case was one, however, which settled a "general principle of the Jewish government;" and, therefore, it was applicable to the case before the apostle. If the thing for which he was contending - that the Jews might be rejected existed in the time of Isaiah, and was settled then as a precedent, it might exist also in his time, and under the gospel.<p>As the sand of the sea - This expression is used to denote an indefinite or an innumerable multitude. It often occurs in the sacred writings. In the infancy of society, before the art of numbering was carried to a great extent, people were obliged to express themselves very much in this manner, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>, "I will multiply thy seed ...as the sand which is upon the seashore;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-12.htm">Isaiah 32:12</a>, Isaiah doubtless had reference to this promise; "Though all that was promised to Abraham shall be fulfilled, and his seed shall be as numerous as God declared, yet a remnant only, etc." The apostle thus shows that his doctrine does not conflict at all with the utmost expectation of the Jews drawn from the promises of God; see a similar use of the term "sand" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-11.htm">2 Samuel 17:11</a>, etc. In the same manner great numbers were denoted by the stars of heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>.<p>A remnant shall be saved - Meaning a remnant only. This implies that great multitudes of them would be "cast off," and "be not saved." If only a remnant was to be saved, many must be lost; and this was just the point which the apostle was endeavoring to establish. The word "remnant" means what is left, particularly what may remain after a battle or a great calamity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-31.htm">2 Kings 19:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-11.htm">2 Kings 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-22.htm">Isaiah 14:22</a>. In this place, however, it means a small part or portion. Out of the great multitude there shall be so few left as to make it proper to say that it was a mere remnant. This implies, of course, that the great mass should be cast away or rejected. And this was the use which the apostle intended to make of it; compare the Wisdom of Sirach, xliv. 17, "Noah ...was left unto the earth as a remnant when the flood came."<p>Shall be saved - Shall be preserved or kept from destruction. As Isaiah had reference to the captivity of Babylon. this means that only a remnant should return to their native land. The great mass should be rejected and cast off. This was the case with the ten tribes, and also with many others who chose to remain in the land of their captivity The use which the apostle makes of it is this: In the history of the Jews, by the testimony of Isaiah, a large part of the Jews of that time were rejected, and cast off from being the special people of God. It is clear, therefore, that God has brought himself under no obligation to save all the descendants of Abraham. This case settles the principle. If God did it then, it was equally consistent for him to do it in the time of Paul, under the gospel. The conclusion, therefore, to which the apostle came, that it was the intention of God to reject and cast off the Jews as a people, was in strict accordance with their own history and the prophecies. It was still true that a remnant was to be saved, while the great mass of the people was rejected. The apostle is not to be understood here as affirming that the passage in Isaiah had reference to the gospel, but only that "it settled one great principle of the divine administration in regard to the Jews, and that their rejection under the gospel was strictly in accordance with that principle."<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-29.

The apostle having produced proper testimonies in proof of the calling of the Gentiles, proceeds to mention others; showing, that some few of the Jews also were to be called, according to prophecy, founded upon divine predestination; which, though they are full proofs of the calling of some from among the Jews, yet at the same time suggest the casting off of the far greater number of them; and which is the apostle's view in citing them, as appears from what he says both here and in the two following chapters. The first testimony is taken out of  <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, and is prefaced or introduced with these words; which either express the great concern of mind and sorrow of heart, with which the prophet spoke them, even with strong crying and tears, seeing a remnant of them only was to be saved; or they show his heart's desire and prayer to God, "for Israel", as the words may be rendered, how that he cried to the Lord for them, entreated him with earnestness and importunity, and wrestled with him on their behalf; or they declare the presence of mind, the freedom of expression, the boldness and intrepidity with which he delivered this message to the Jews, which he knew must be ungrateful to them; in doing which, he run the risk of losing his interest in their affections, if not his life; and inasmuch very probably they did not choose to hear it, but turned away from him, he cried aloud, he spared not, he lift up his voice like a trumpet, as he is bid to do elsewhere, resolving they should hear what he had to say, from the Lord of hosts. This is a form of speech used by the Jews, in citing Scripture; thus, , "the prophet cries" (p), namely, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>, which is spoken of the same prophet as here; and again (q) the Holy Spirit   "cries, and says", in some certain passage of Scripture; and in another place (r) the Holy Spirit "cried", saying, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-3.htm">Joel 3:3</a>, "they have cast lots for my people". <p>Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea: this part of the testimony seems rather to be taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>, which may easily be accounted for; since the apostle had just cited the words in Hosea, and so carrying them in his mind, transcribes this sentence from thence; it perfectly agreeing in sense with the passage in Isaiah he had in view, where it stands thus, "though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea", <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>; that is, though the number of them be such as to be compared thereunto; though they are many as the sand of the sea, as the Targum, Kimchi, and Aben Ezra explain it. This was promised unto Abraham, and had its accomplishment in the days of Solomon, and in after times; they were for quantity, for number, as the sand of the sea, even innumerable; and for quality, being barren and unfruitful, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers: <p>a remnant shall be saved; that is, a few persons only;  , "few are called a remnant", as Kimchi on the place observes; these are the remnant among the Jews, according to the election of grace; the few that were chosen, though many were called by the external ministry of Christ and his apostles; the little city, and few men in it, even the escaped of Israel, he that was left in Zion, and that remained in Jerusalem; the little flock among them, which were as sheep among wolves; the few that entered in at the strait gate, and found the way to eternal life; the few that shall be saved; and these shall certainly be saved, with a spiritual and eternal salvation. These, according to the prophecy, were to return to the mighty God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah; be converted to him, and so saved by him with an everlasting salvation: God had resolved upon it, whose counsel shall stand; he had promised it in covenant, which is ordered in all things and sure; he sent his Son to save these his people from their sins, who is become the author of eternal salvation to them; the grace of God is efficacious and powerful enough, to make them willing to be saved by Christ, and to bring them to him, to venture upon him, and commit their souls to him, to be saved by him; and almighty power is concerned, to keep them through faith unto salvation: so that this little remnant, through the Father's everlasting and unchangeable love, the Son's purchase, prayers, and preparations, and the spirits grace, which works them up for this selfsame thing, shall be certainly and completely saved; though with respect to the difficulties attending it, which could have been surmounted by none but Christ, and by reason of their discouragements arising from sin, temptations, and persecutions, they may be said to be scarcely saved. <p>(p) Tanchuma, fol. 17. 3. apud Surenhus.

The LXX reads <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐὰν γένηται ὁ λαὸς Ἰσραὴλ ὡς ἡ ἄμμος τῆς θαλάσσης</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ κατάλειμμα αὐτῶν σωθήσεται</span>. <span class="greekheb">λόγον συντελῶν καὶ συντέμνων</span> [<span class="greekheb">ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι λόγον συντετμημένον</span>] <span class="greekheb">κύριος ποιήσει ἐν τῇ οἰκουμένῃ ὅλῃ</span>. The words bracketed are omitted by most editors, but the sense is not affected. <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπόλειμμα</span> has the emphasis: <span class="ital">only</span> the remnant shall be saved. This doctrine Paul apparently finds confirmed by the words <span class="greekheb">λόγον γὰρ συντελῶν καὶ συντέμνων ποιήσει κύριος ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς</span>. It is doubtful whether any one could assign meaning to these words unless he had an idea beforehand of what they ought to or must mean. Cheyne renders the Hebrew to which they answer, “For a final work and a decisive doth the Lord execute within all the land”; and there is the same general idea in Sanday and Headlam’s version of Paul: “For a word, accomplishing and abridging it, that is, a sentence conclusive and concise, will the Lord do upon the earth”. Weiss, who retains the words bracketed, makes <span class="greekheb">λόγον</span> = God’s promise: God fulfils it indeed (<span class="greekheb">συντελῶν</span>), but He at the same time limits or contracts it (<span class="greekheb">συντέμνων</span>), <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, fulfils it to some of Israel, not to all. This, no doubt, is the sense required, but can any one say that the words convey it? We should rather say that Paul put his own thought into the words of the LXX, in which a difficult passage of Isaiah was translated almost at haphazard, and in doing so lent them a meaning which they could not be said to have of themselves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">Esaias also</span>] Better, <span class="bld">But Esaias</span>.

Heb. is “For though thy people Israel (or, O Israel,) be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall return thereof; the consumption decreed is overflowing in righteousness; for a final work and a decisive work doth the Lord execute in the midst of all the earth (or, land).” The LXX. reads; “Even if the people Israel become as the sand of the sea; their (or, the) remnant shall be saved. (He is) completing and cutting short in righteousness; because a work cut short will the Lord (or, Lord God of Hosts) do in the whole world.” St Paul adopts nearly the words of LXX.; again (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-25.htm" title="As he said also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.">Romans 9:25</a>, and very often,) developing a second and deeper fulfilment where the first fulfilment lay in past events of Israelite history; e.g. here, in the comparatively <span class="ital">small</span> returns of the exiles, under Zerubbabel and Ezra. The “return,” in the Second Fulfilment, is a return to Christ, and thus equivalent to “<span class="ital">salvation</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the number of</span>] These words are perhaps borrowed and inserted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm" title="Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there it shall be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.">Hosea 1:10</a>; a verse close to the last quotation.

The passage is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>, which had primary reference to the remnant of the house of Israel that should "return unto the mighty God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21</a>) after the then predicted devastation of the nation by the Assyrian king. The series of prophecies with which this is connected begins at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>, which gives an account of Isaiah's memorable visit to Ahaz King of Judah, on the occasion of the combination of Pekah King of Israel, and Rezin King of Syria, against Jerusalem, in the course of which visit he predicts the birth of Immanuel. He took with him his son, who bore the symbolical name of Shear-jashub ("A remnant shall return"). Subsequently another son was born to the prophet, to whom was given the name Maher-shalal-hash-baz ("Swift of spoil, hasty of prey," as Ewald renders; or, "The spoil speedeth, the prey hasteth," as in margin of the Revised Version); the latter name having been previously written on a great roll (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>). The primary drift of the prophecies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>. and the following chapters is that the confederacy of Pekah and Reziu against Jerusalem shall fail, that their own lands would ere long be devastated by the Assyrian king, who would sweep irresistibly over Judah too; but that God's people may still trust in the LORD'S protection, who would preserve and bring back a remnant, though a remnant only. The three names, Maher-shalal-hash-baz, Shear-jashub, and Immanuel ("God with us"), are throughout significant of the leading ideas of the whole series of predictions; the first expressing the certainty of coming judgment, the second the return of the remnant, and the third God's own presence with his people. Now, without pausing to consider what primary historical fulfilment of the prophecy about Immanuel there might be in the way of type, we cannot but perceive, in the language and tone of much in this series of prophecies, a distinct Messianic reference. We cannot, for instance, otherwise understand <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6, 7</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11</a>. there succeeds an ideal picture of peace and blessing under the "rod out of the stem of Jesse," which is undoubtedly Messianic. Hence the relevance of the passage, not only as showing God's way of dealing with his people in times of old, but also as an intimation of how it should be when the Messiah should come. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Crieth (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>An impassioned utterance.
