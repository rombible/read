Or, as some understand the expression to mean, I recommend a duty to you, suited to human nature; yea, even to the infirmities thereof; that you should do as much for God as you have done for sin, and be as diligent in the service of Christ as you have been in the pursuit of your lusts. <span class="ital">For as </span>— In time past, while you were ignorant of the gospel, and many of you the slaves of heathen vice and idolatry; <span class="ital">ye yielded your members servants to uncleanness </span>— To various fleshly lusts which defiled you; <span class="ital">and to iniquity </span>— Or unrighteousness toward others; <span class="ital">unto iniquity </span>— Adding one iniquity to another; <span class="ital">even so now </span>— Being enlightened by the gospel to see the evil of such things, and the miserable consequences awaiting them; and being renewed by the influences of divine grace, it is but reasonable that you should be as ready to pursue a pious and virtuous line of conduct, and to do good now, as formerly you were to do evil; and become <span class="ital">servants of righteousness unto holiness </span>— Observe, reader, they who are true servants of righteousness, which may here mean a conformity to the divine will, go on to holiness, which implies a conformity to the divine nature. <span class="ital">For when ye were the servants of sin — </span>Were under its guilt and power; <span class="ital">ye were free from righteousness </span>— You not only had not righteousness enough, but, strictly speaking, had no true righteousness at all; never doing any single action that was truly good, and, on the whole, acceptable to God, because none was performed from such principles as could entitle it to his complete approbation. In all reason, therefore, ye ought now to be free from unrighteousness; to be as uniform and zealous in serving God as you were in serving the devil. <span class="ital">What fruit had ye then in those things </span>— Consider, what advantage did you derive from the practices to which you were then habituated, and <span class="ital">whereof ye are now ashamed? </span>— The very remembrance of which now gives you pain, and creates in you much remorse and trouble? <span class="ital">For the end of those things is death </span>— The word <span class="greekheb">τελος</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">end, </span>signifies both the end for which a thing is done, and the last issue of it. It is used in the former sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-9.htm" title="Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.">1 Peter 1:9</a>; <span class="ital">receiving, </span><span class="greekheb">το τελος</span>, <span class="ital">the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls; </span>the end or purpose for which ye believed.

The apostle rejoiced now they obeyed from the heart the gospel, into which they were delivered as into a mould. As the same metal becomes a new vessel, when melted and recast in another mould, so the believer has become a new creature. And there is great difference in the liberty of mind and spirit, so opposite to the state of slavery, which the true Christian has in the service of his rightful Lord, whom he is enabled to consider as his Father, and himself as his son and heir, by the adoption of grace. The dominion of sin consists in being willingly slaves thereto, not in being harassed by it as a hated power, struggling for victory. Those who now are the servants of God, once were the slaves of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I speak after the manner of men - I speak as people usually speak; or I draw an illustration from common life, in order to make myself better understood.<p>Because of the infirmity of your flesh - The word "infirmity" means weakness, feebleness; and is opposed to vigor and strength. The word "flesh" is used often to denote the corrupt passions of people; but it may refer here to their intellect, or understanding; "Because of your imperfection of spiritual knowledge; or incapacity to discern arguments and illustrations that would be more strictly spiritual in their character." This dimness or feebleness had been caused by long indulgence in sinful passions, and by the blinding influence which such passions have on the mind. The sense here is, "I use an illustration drawn from common affairs, from the well-known relations of master and slave, because you will better see the force of such an illustration with which you have been familiar, than you would one that would be more abstract, and more strictly spiritual." It is a kind of apology for drawing an illustration from the relation of master and slave.<p>For as ye have yielded - Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>. Servants to uncleanness. Have been in bondage to impurity. The word "uncleanness" here refers to impurity of life in any form; to the degraded passions that were common among the heathen; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a>.<p>And to iniquity - Transgression of law.<p>Unto iniquity - For the purpose of committing iniquity. It implies that they had done it in an excessive degree. It is well for Christians to be reminded of their former lives, to awaken repentance, to excite gratitude, to produce humility and a firmer purpose to live to the honor of God. This is the use which the apostle here makes of it.<p>Unto holiness - In order to practice holiness. Let the surrender of your members to holiness be as sincere and as unqualified as the surrender was to sin. This is all that is required of Christians. Before conversion they were wholly given to sin; after conversion they should be wholly given to God. If all Christians would employ the same energies in advancing the kingdom of God that they have in promoting the kingdom, of Satan, the church would rise with dignity and grandeur, and every continent and island would soon feel the movement. No requirement is more reasonable than this; and it should be a source of lamentation and mourning with Christians that it is not so; that they have employed so mighty energies in the cause of Satan, and do so little in the service of God. This argument for energy in the divine life, the apostle proceeds further to illustrate by comparing the rewards obtained in the two kinds of servitude, that of the world, and of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

This refers either to what the apostle had said already concerning service and liberty, things which were known among men, and easy to be understood; or to the following exhortation: what he was about to say, he delivered in a manner suited to their understandings, and was  "that which was human"; not angelic, or what required the power, purity, and perfection of angels; or what was unreasonable or impossible, but what was their reasonable service, as men; and might be done through the grace of God, in the strength of Christ, and by the assistance of the Spirit: and though he might have insisted upon it with good reason, that they ought to be more diligent and industrious in the service of God than they had been in the service of sin; yet <p>because of the infirmity of their flesh, considering that they had flesh, or corrupt nature, and were attended with weakness in knowledge, faith, and obedience; he only pressed this upon them, that in like manner as they had been servants to sin, they would be servants to righteousness: <p>for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity unto iniquity; what they yielded to the service of sin were their "members"; by which, as before, may be meant, either the powers and faculties of their souls, or the parts and members of their bodies, or both; and particularly the latter, as the eyes and ears, the tongue, the mouth, the hands, and feet, which are all employed by a natural man in the drudgery of sin: these are yielded to sin under the form and character of "servants"; and as such are governed, directed, and ordered to fulfil this and the other lust, which is done willingly and readily: these members are "yielded", presented, and given up cheerfully to this slavery; which is both scandalous and unrighteous: it is "to uncleanness"; which designs all sorts of pollution and filthiness, both of flesh and spirit: "and to iniquity"; everything that is contrary to the law, all unrighteousness and ungodliness; and it is added, "unto iniquity"; which may design all sorts of sin, a progress in it, adding continually to it; which shows them to have been thorough hearty servants of sin. Now what the apostle exhorts to, and requires of them, is, that <p>even so now they would yield their members servants to righteousness unto holiness; that is, let the same members that have been employed in the service of sin, be made use of in the service of righteousness: let your eyes be employed in looking and diligently searching into the Scriptures of truth; your ears in hearing the Gospel preached; your lips, mouth, and tongue, in expressing the praises of God, for what he has done for you; your hands in distributing to the interest of religion, and the necessities of the saints; and your feet in hastening to attend on public worship, and observe the testimonies of the Lord: let them be employed under the same form and character as servants, waiting upon the Lord, ready to fulfil his will; and in the same manner, freely, willingly, and cheerfully, and that constantly and universally, in all acts of righteousness and holiness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-19.htm" title="I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness to holiness.">Romans 6:19</a>. Paul had, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-16.htm" title="Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?...">Romans 6:16-18</a>, represented the idea of the highest moral freedom—in a form corresponding indeed with its nature as a moral necessity (“Deo servire vera libertas est,” Augustine), but still borrowed from human relations—as <span class="greekheb">δουλεία</span>. He now therefore, not to justify himself, but to induce his readers to separate the idea from the form, announces <span class="ital">the fact that</span>, and the <span class="ital">reason why</span>, he thus expresses himself regarding the loftiest moral idea in this concrete fashion, derived from an ordinary human relation. <span class="ital">I speak</span> (in here making mention of <span class="ital">slavery</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-16.htm" title="Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?...">Romans 6:16-18</a>) <span class="ital">what is human</span> (belonging to the relations of the natural human life) <span class="ital">on account of the</span> (intellectual) <span class="ital">weakness of your flesh, i.e.</span> in order thereby to come to the help of this your weakness. For the setting forth of the idea in some such sensuous form is the appropriate means of stimulating and procuring its apprehension in the case of one, whose knowledge has not yet been elevated by divine enlightenment to a higher platform of strength and clearness released from such human forms. Respecting <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπινον</span> see the examples in Wetstein. It is the antithesis of <span class="greekheb">θεῖον</span>, Plat. <span class="ital">Rep.</span> p. 497 C. The expression <span class="greekheb">κατὰ ἄνθρωπον λέγω</span> in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-5.htm" title="But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)">Romans 3:5</a> is in substance equivalent, since <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπινον</span> also necessarily indicates the <span class="ital">form and dress</span> employed for the idea, for whose representation the Apostle has uttered <span class="ital">what is human</span>. The <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>, however, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the material human nature in its psychical determination, as contrasted with the divine pneumatic influence (comp on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm" title="What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?">Romans 4:1</a>), is <span class="ital">weak</span> for religious and moral <span class="ital">discernment</span>, as well as for good (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-41.htm" title="Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.">Matthew 26:41</a>); hence the <span class="greekheb">σοφία σαρκική</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>) is foolishness with God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm" title="For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>). Others, taking it not of intellectual weakness, but of <span class="ital">moral</span> weakness, refer it to what <span class="ital">follows</span> (Origen, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Erasmus, Calvin, Estius, Hammond, Wetstein, and others, including Klee, Reithmayr, and Bisping), in the sense: “I do not demand what is too hard (<span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπ</span>., comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>); for although I might require a far higher degree of the new obedience, yet I require only the same as ye have formerly rendered to sin.”[1483] But the following <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὭΣΠΕΡ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ΟὝΤΩ</span></span></span> introduces not the equality of the <span class="ital">degree</span>, but, as is plain from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-20.htm" title="For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.">Romans 6:20</a>, only the comparison in general between the former and the present state. Besides, the demand itself, which by this interpretation would only concern a lower stage of Christian life, would be inappropriate to the morally ideal character of the whole hortatory discourse, which is not injured by the concrete figurative form. This remark also applies to the dismembering explanation of Hofmann (comp Th. Schott), who makes <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΘΡΏΠΙΝΟΝ ΛΈΓΩ</span></span></span> form a parenthesis, and then connects <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΤῊΝ ἈΣΘΈΝΕΙΑΝ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΣΑΡΚῸς ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΔΟΥΛΏΘΗΤΕ Τῇ ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝῌ</span></span></span>, so that the thought would be: the weakness of our in born nature gives occasion that our translation into the life of righteousness is dealt with as an <span class="ital">enslavement</span> thereto, while otherwise it would be simply restoration to the freedom of doing our own will; according to this weakness what is right is not done freely of itself, but in the shape of a <span class="ital">service</span>. But how could Paul have so <span class="ital">degraded</span> the moral <span class="ital">loftiness</span> of the position of the <span class="greekheb">δουλωθέντες τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ</span>!

Paul apologises for using this human figure of the relation of slave to master to convey spiritual truths. But what is “the weakness of the flesh” which makes him have recourse to such figures? Weiss makes it moral. The Apostle speaks with this unmistakable plainness and emphasis because he is writing to morally weak persons whose nature and past life really made them liable to temptations to libertinism. This seems to me confirmed by the reference, which immediately follows, to the character of their pre-Christian life. Others make the weakness rather intellectual than ethical, as if Paul said: “I condescend to your want of spiritual intelligence in using such figures”. But this is not a natural meaning for “the weakness of your flesh,” and does not yield so good a connection with what follows. <span class="greekheb">δοῦλα τῇ ἀκαθαρσίᾳ καὶ τῇ ἀνομίᾳ</span>: <span class="greekheb">ἀκαθαρσία</span> defiling the sinner, <span class="greekheb">ἀνομία</span> disregarding the will of God.

St. Paul may mean, "In saying you were made <span class="accented">slaves to</span> righteousness, I am using human language not properly applicable to your spiritual relations. For you are not really in bondage now; you have been emancipated from your former bondage to sin, and are now called upon to render a free willing allowance to righteousness; being, in fact, sons, not slaves." This view of the true position of the Christian being one of freedom recurs so often and so forcibly with St. Paul that it is peculiarly likely to be the thought before him here; the very word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> would be likely to suggest it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, <span class="accented">seq.</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-17.htm">2 Corinthians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1, 13</a>). If (he would say) you fully realized your position as sons of God, you would feel it impossible even to think of sinning willingly; but, in accommodation to your human weakness, I put the case as if you had only been transferred from one bondage to another, so as to show that, even so, you are under an <span class="accented">obligation</span> not to sin. According to this view of the meaning of the passage, "the infirmity of your flesh" has reference to dulness of spiritual perception, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> being opposed in a general sense to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>.

Some, however, taking <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> to denote <span class="accented">moral</span> weakness, which renders the attainment of holiness difficult for man (cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-38.htm">Mark 14:38</a>), understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span> as meaning, "I require of you no more than is possible &Ntilde; for your frail humanity; for I call on you only to render to righteousness the same allegiance you once rendered to sin." This interpretation gives a totally different meaning to the clause. It has the support of Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Calvin, Estius, Wetstein, and others; but it does not appear so natural or probable as the other, which is accepted by most modern commentators. <span class="cmt_word">For as ye yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto sanctification</span> (rather than <span class="accented">holiness</span>, as in the Authorized Version; the word is <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, always so translated elsewhere). This is a setting forth of what must follow in practice from the view that has been taken of the change in the Christian's position resembling the transference of bondservants from one master to another. They must devote their <span class="accented">members</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> above on ver. 13) to the service of the new master in the same way as they had done to that of the old one; the aims or results of the two services being also intimated. The old service was in giving themselves up to <span class="accented">uncleanness</span> (with reference to sins of sensuality), and generally to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. lawlessness</span>, or disregard of duty; and its result is expressed by a repetition of the latter word. For sin leads to nothing positive; lawless conduct only results in a habit or state of lawlessness; whereas the service of righteousness in itself leads to sanctification to the abiding result of participation in the holiness of God. "Qui justitiae serviunt, proficiunt; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">iniqui</span>, sunt <span class="accented">iniqui</span>, nil amplius" (Bengel). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>After the manner of men (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., what is human, popularly.
