Unholy professors may have had the outward sign of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, but they never passed from the family of Satan to that of God. The corrupt nature, called the old man, because derived from our first father Adam, is crucified with Christ, in every true believer, by the grace derived from the cross. It is weakened and in a dying state, though it yet struggles for life, and even for victory. But the whole body of sin, whatever is not according to the holy law of God, must be done away, so that the believer may no more be the slave of sin, but live to God, and find happiness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This passage is a confirmation and illustration of what the apostle had said before, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-5.htm">Romans 6:5-7</a>.

This does not imply any doubt about it, but is rather a taking it for granted: seeing we are dead with Christ by union with him, as our head and representative, and by communion with him in the benefits of his death, and being planted together in the likeness of it; or being dead to the law, sin, and the world, through the virtue and efficacy of Christ's death: <p>we believe that we shall also live with him; not only a life of justification by faith in his righteousness; and a life of sanctification from him, and to his glory; the continuance of which, and a perseverance in it, are firmly believed; but a life of glory and happiness with him hereafter, both in the new Jerusalem, in the new heavens, and new earth, in the glorious state of the church on earth, and in heaven to all eternity; where they shall be personally and visibly with him, in soul and body, and shall live in the most intimate and uninterrupted communion with him, enjoying the highest pleasure, and the most consummate happiness; and are therefore under the greatest obligation, whilst here on earth, to live, not in sin, but to righteousness, and to his praise and glory; with whom they are now dead to sin, and with whom they not only hope, but believe they shall live throughout the endless ages of eternity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a> f. <span class="ital">Carrying onward</span> the discussion by the metabatic <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>; and thereby passing from the <span class="ital">negative</span> side of the having died with Christ as proved in personal consciousness (<span class="greekheb">τοῦτο γινώσκοντες</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>) in. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin....">Romans 6:6-7</a>, to its <span class="ital">positive</span> side, which is likewise exhibited as based on the consciousness of faith (<span class="greekheb">πιστεύομεν</span>). “But if we have <span class="ital">died</span> (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin....">Romans 6:6-7</a>) with Christ, we believe that we shall also <span class="ital">live</span> with Him, since we know,” etc. etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πιστεύομεν</span>] expresses, not confidence in the divine aid (Fritzsche), or in the divine promise (Baumgarten-Crusius), or in God not leaving His work of grace in us unfinished (Philippi); but simply the <span class="ital">being convinced of our</span> <span class="greekheb">συζήσομεν αὐτῷ</span>; in so far, namely, as the having died with Christ is, seeing that He has risen and dieth no more, in the consciousness of faith the necessary premiss, and thus the ground for belief as to our becoming alive with Him. If the former, the <span class="greekheb">ἀπεθάνομεν σὺν Χριστῷ</span>, be true, we cannot doubt the latter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συζήσομεν αὐτῷ</span>] must necessarily be understood, in accordance with the preceding and following context (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>), of the <span class="ital">ethical</span> participation in the new everlasting life of Christ. Whosoever has died with Christ is now also of the belief that his life, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the positive active side of his moral being and nature, shall be a fellowship of life with the exalted Christ; that is, shall be able to be nothing else than this. This communion of life is the <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ</span> and <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸν ἐν ἡμῖν εἶναι</span>. In the full consciousness of it Paul says: <span class="greekheb">ζῶ δὲ οὐκέτι ἐγὼ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ζῇ δὲ ἐν ἐμοὶ Χριστός</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>). At the same time it is not to be explained as if an <span class="greekheb">ἀεί</span> or the like stood beside <span class="greekheb">συζήσομεν</span> (without falling away), as is done by Tholuck; compare Theophylact. Others, in opposition to the context, hold that what is meant is the future participation of Christians in the bliss of the glorified Saviour (Flatt, Reiche, Maier, following Origen, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Grotius, and Heumann); and others still, at variance alike with the definiteness and unity of the sense, interpret it of the earthly moral and the eternal blessed life <span class="ital">together</span> (Sebastian Schmid, Böhme, Rosenmuller; and not rejected by de Wette). The reference or joint-reference to the future glory is not required either by the <span class="ital">future</span>, which, on the contrary, demands the same rendering exactly as <span class="greekheb">ἐσόμεθα</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-5.htm" title="For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:">Romans 6:5</a>, nor by <span class="greekheb">πιστεύομεν</span> (see above).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἱδότες</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[1422]] <span class="ital">Since we know, that</span>, etc. Were we, namely, obliged to fear that Christ is still subject to the power of death,[1423] that his life is not a perfected life, in that case we should lack the adequate secure <span class="ital">ground of faith</span> for that <span class="greekheb">πιστεύομεν <span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[1424] The being assured that Christ liveth eternally and dieth no more (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-34.htm" title="And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.">Acts 13:34</a>), lends to our faith in our own moral communion of life with Him its basis and firm footing; without that knowledge this faith would be wanting in that which gives it legitimacy and guarantee. For who can cherish the conviction that he stands in that holy communion of resurrection-life with Christ, if he should be compelled to doubt whether his Lord, though indeed risen, might not again fall a victim to death? This thought would only keep us aloof from that faith and make it a moral impossibility for us, since it would set before us the prospect of a similar perishing of the new life which we had gained. Hofmann, who makes a new sentence begin with <span class="greekheb">εἰδότες</span>, which is to continue till <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>, might have been warned against doing so by the absence of a particle (<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>); and should have been decisively precluded from it by the tortuous way in which, if <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-10.htm" title="For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he lives, he lives to God.">Romans 6:10</a> is set aside in a parenthesis, it is necessary to obtain a forced regimen for the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">θάνατος αὐτοῦ οὐκέτι κυρ</span>.] no longer dependent on <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, but an independent and therefore all the more emphatic repetition of the important thought: <span class="ital">death is no longer Lord over Him</span>, has no more power over Him, such as it once had at the crucifixion. Comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1422] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1423] Death <span class="ital">had become</span> lord over Him, because in obedience to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Php 2:6</a> ff.)

The <span class="greekheb">κυριεύειν</span> of death over Him was therefore a thing willed by God (v. 8–10), and realised through the voluntary obedience of Jesus.
