If it were possible that the life of Christ should fail, the whole fabric that the believer’s faith builds upon it would fall to the ground.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:3-10 Baptism teaches the necessity of dying to sin, and being as it were buried from all ungodly and unholy pursuits, and of rising to walk with God in newness of life. Unholy professors may have had the outward sign of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, but they never passed from the family of Satan to that of God. The corrupt nature, called the old man, because derived from our first father Adam, is crucified with Christ, in every true believer, by the grace derived from the cross. It is weakened and in a dying state, though it yet struggles for life, and even for victory. But the whole body of sin, whatever is not according to the holy law of God, must be done away, so that the believer may no more be the slave of sin, but live to God, and find happiness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knowing - As we all know.

That Christ is risen from the dead, is a certain fact, well attested, thoroughly known, and firmly believed; the prophets prophesied of it, Christ himself foretold it, angels affirmed it, and the apostles were witnesses of it, as is also the Holy Ghost: and it is as certain, that he <p>dieth no more; he is raised to an immortal life, and will live for evermore; there is no need of his dying again, his death having been a full atonement and expiation of all the sins and transgressions of his people: <p>death hath no more dominion over him: it once had dominion over him; it held him under its power for a time, according to the divine determination, and by his own consent: but it was not possible he should be holden of it longer; both on account of the dignity of his person, as the Son of God, and the virtue and efficacy of his sacrifice, as the surety of his people, having put away sin for ever by it. He is the holy man the Jews (u) speak of, <p>"who is the mystery of the name Jehovah, and in him there is no sin, neither shall death have the dominion over him.'' <p>(u) Tikkune Zohar, fol. 112. p. 1. apud Rittangel. de verit.

The post-resurrection life of Jesus was not His old life over again; in that life death had dominion over Him, because He made Himself one with us in all the consequences of sin; but now the dominion of death has expired. The principle of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-7.htm" title="For he that is dead is freed from sin.">Romans 6:7</a> can be applied to Christ also: He has died, and the powers which in the old relations had claims upon Him—death, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>—have such claims no more.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/romans/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">knowing</span>] As an admitted foundation-truth.
