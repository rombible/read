The Christian’s union with the crucified Christ binds him also to crucify or mortify (ascetically) the sinful desires of his body. Thus he is released from the dominion of those desires. But this is not all. Just as Christ passed from the cross to the resurrection, and overcame death once for all, exchanging for it a life wholly dependent upon God; so, too, His followers must consider themselves cut off irrevocably—as if by death itself—from sin, and living with a new life dedicated and devoted to God, through their participation in the death and life of Jesus Christ their Lord.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Our old man.</span>—“Our old self” (Vaughan), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9-10</a>.<p>The old self, or that congeries of evil habits acquired in the state of heathenism, was, ideally if not actually, mortified and killed in our baptism. This change was wrought by a power brought to bear upon the will through the contemplation of the crucifixion of Christ. Hence, instead of saying simply “mortified,” the Apostle writes rather “crucified,” <span class= "ital">i.e.</span> put to death, not in any way, but specially <span class= "ital">through the cross.</span><p><span class= "bld">That the body of sin might be destroyed.</span>—The “body of sin” is the body subject to sin, or that supplies sin with the material on which it works. This substratum of carnal and fleshly desire, the Apostle tells us, is to be ascetically chastened and disciplined until it ceases to be a source of sin.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/romans/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:3-10 Baptism teaches the necessity of dying to sin, and being as it were buried from all ungodly and unholy pursuits, and of rising to walk with God in newness of life. Unholy professors may have had the outward sign of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, but they never passed from the family of Satan to that of God. The corrupt nature, called the old man, because derived from our first father Adam, is crucified with Christ, in every true believer, by the grace derived from the cross. It is weakened and in a dying state, though it yet struggles for life, and even for victory. But the whole body of sin, whatever is not according to the holy law of God, must be done away, so that the believer may no more be the slave of sin, but live to God, and find happiness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knowing this - We all knowing this. All Christians are supposed to know this. This is a new illustration drawn from the fact that by his crucifixion our corrupt nature has been crucified also, or put to death; and that thus we should be free from the servitude of sin.<p>Our old man - This expression occurs also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>, "That ye put off ...the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts." <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>, "lie not to one another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds." From these passages it is evident that Paul uses the expression to denote our sinful and corrupt nature; the passions and evil propensities that exist before the heart is renewed. It refers to the love of sin, the indulgence of sinful propensities, in opposition to the new disposition which exists after the soul is converted, and which is called "the new man."<p>Is crucified - Is put to death, as if on a cross. In this expression there is a personification of the corrupt propensities of our nature represented as "our old man," our native disposition, etc. The figure is here carried out, and this old man, this corrupt nature, is represented as having been put to death in an agonizing and torturing manner. The pains of crucifixion were perhaps the most torturing of any that the human frame could bear. Death in this manner was most lingering and distressing. And the apostle here by the expression "is crucified" doubtless refers to the painful and protracted struggle which everyone goes through when his evil propensities are subdued; when his corrupt nature is slain; and when, a converted sinner, he gives himself up to God. Sin dies within him, and he becomes dead to the world, and to sin; "for as by the cross death is most lingering and severe, so that corrupt nature is not subdued but by anguish." (Grotius.) All who have been born again can enter into this description. They remember "the wormwood and the gall." They remember the anguish of conviction; the struggle of corrupt passion for the ascendency; the dying convulsions of sin in the heart; the long and lingering conflict before it was subdued, and the soul became submissive to God. Nothing will better express this than the lingering agony of crucifixion: and the argument of the apostle is, that as sin has produced such an effect, and as the Christian is now free from its embrace and its power, he will live to God.<p>With him - The word "with" &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;  sun here is joined to the verb "is crucified" and means "is crucified as he was."<p>That the body of sin - This expression doubtless means the same as that which he had just used, "our old man," But why the term "body" is used, has been a subject in which interpreters have not been agreed. Some say that it is a Hebraism, denoting mere intensity or emphasis. Some that it means the same as flesh, that is, denoting our sinful propensities and lusts. Grotius thinks that the term "body" is elegantly attributed to sin, because the body of man is made up of many members joined together compactly, and sin also consists of numerous vices and evil propensities joined compactly, as it were, in one body. But the expression is evidently merely another form of conveying the idea contained in the phrase "our old man" - a personification of sin as if it had a living form, and as if it had been put to death on a cross. It refers to the moral destruction of the power of sin in the heart by the gospel, and not to any physical change in the nature or faculties of the soul; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>.<p>Might be destroyed - Might be put to death; might become inoperative and powerless. Sin becomes enervated, weakened, and finally annihilated, by the work of the Cross.<p>We should not serve - Should not be the slave of sin &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  douleuein. That we should not be subject to its control. The sense is, that before this we were slaves of sin (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17</a>,) but that now we are made free from this bondage, because the moral death of sin has freed us from it.<p>Sin - Sin is here personified as a master that had dominion over us, but is now dead. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7.

By the old man is meant the corruption of nature; called a man, because natural to men; it lives and dwells in them; it has spread itself over the whole man; it rules and governs in men; and consists of various parts and members, as a man does: it is called "old", because it is the poison of the old serpent, with which man was infected by him from the beginning; it is derived from the first man that ever was; it is as old as the man is, in whom it is, and is likewise called so, with respect to its duration and continuance; and in opposition to, and contradistinction from, the new man, or principle of grace: it is called "ours", because continual to us; it is in our nature, it cleaves to us, and abides in us. This name the apostle took from his countrymen the Jews, who were wont to call the vitiosity of nature hereby; so R. Aba on that passage, "the firstborn said to the younger, our father is old", <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-31.htm">Genesis 19:31</a>, asks, what is the meaning of this, "our father is old?" this, answers he, is the evil imagination, or corruption of nature, which is called  "old", according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:13</a>; and is said to be old,  , "because it is born with the man" (o); or as the reason is elsewhere given (p), because it is joined to him from his birth, to his old age: this, they say (q), is with a man as soon as he is born, from the hour of his birth, as soon as ever he comes into the world. Now this is said to be "crucified with him"; that is, with Christ, when he was crucified: the Jews (r) have a notion that the evil imagination, or corruption of nature, , will not be made to cease, or be abolished out of the world, till the King Messiah comes, and by him it is abolished: this is so crucified by the death, and at the cross of Christ, as that it cannot exert its damning power over believers; and is so crucified by the Spirit and grace of Christ in them, as that it cannot reign over them, or exercise its domineering power over them; wherefore they are dead unto it, and that to them, and therefore cannot live in it; which is done, <p>that the body of sin might be destroyed: by "the body of sin" is meant sin itself, which consists, as a body does, of various members; and also the power and strength of it, which the Jews (s) call  , "the power of the evil imagination"; this is crucified with Christ, and nailed to his cross by his sacrifice and satisfaction, that its damning power might be destroyed, abolished, and done away: and it is crucified by the Spirit and grace of Christ, that its governing power might be took away, and that itself be subdued, weakened, and laid under restraints, and its members and deeds mortified: <p>that henceforth we should not serve sin; not that it should not be in us, for as yet, neither by virtue of the sacrifice of Christ, nor by the power of his grace, is sin as to its being removed from the people of God: but that we should not serve it, make provision for it, indulge it and obey it, in the lusts thereof. <p>(o) Midrash Haneelam in Zohar in Gen. fol. 68. 1.

He might even have-written merely <span class="greekheb">ἡ σάρξ</span>, but <span class="greekheb">τὸ σῶμα</span> was given in the immediate context (<span class="greekheb">συνεσταυρ</span>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1416] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/romans/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>. All this can be asserted, knowing as we do that “our old man” = our old self, what we were before we became Christians—was crucified with Him. Paul says <span class="greekheb">συνεσταυρώθη</span> simply because Christ died on the <span class="ital">cross</span>, and we are baptised into that death, not because “our old man” is the basest of criminals for whom crucifixion is the proper penalty. The object of this crucifixion of the old man was “that the body of sin might be brought to nought”. <span class="greekheb">τὸ σῶμα τῆς ἁμαρτίας</span> is the body in which we live: apart from the crucifixion of the old self it can be characterised as “a body of sin”. It may be wrong to say that it is necessarily and essentially sinful—the body, as such, can have no moral predicate attached to it; it would be as wrong to deny that it is invariably and persistently a seat and source of sin. The genitive is perhaps qualitative rather than possessive, though “the body of which sin has taken possession” (S. and H.) is a good paraphrase. See Winer, p. 235, 768. This body is to be reduced to impotence <span class="greekheb">τοῦ μηκέτι δουλεύειν ἡμᾶς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. “that we may no longer be slaves to sin”. The body is the instrument we use in the service of sin, and if it is disabled the service must cease.

In view of these, the word “<span class="ital">self</span>” in its popular use (“a man’s true self,” &c.) appears to be a fair equivalent for “<span class="ital">man</span>” here. Meyer here gives “<span class="ital">unser altes Ich</span>,” (“our old Ego”).

This clause explains the last: “The body of sin” is so “cancelled” as to its power that the “inner man” no longer is the slave, or obedient victim, of sin, but combats it, with final victory. Before our “death with Christ,” the will, although it was swayed by conscience away from single acts or courses of sin, had never decisively revolted from sin as such, under the one effective motive—supreme love to the Holy God as the God of Peace. Hence, little as he might know it, the man’s will was, in the main respect of all, in harmony with sin, and the tool of sin; for sin in its essence is the not-loving the true God. And the <span class="ital">impending doom</span> of sin, (in other words, <span class="ital">sin as unforgiven sin</span>,) was the strength and secret of this bondage; for till the removal of the doom the man could not love God; God could not be to him the God of Peace.

It does not imply anything further (as some have supposed) as to the manner of our own spiritual dying, such as painfulness or lingering; it merely means that in his death our old man died (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>).

It denotes man's unregenerate self, when under sin and condemnation; the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being his regenerate self.

In Ephesians and Colossians the old man is said to be <span class="accented">put away</span>, or <span class="accented">put off</span>, and the new one <span class="accented">put on, as</span> though they were two clothings, or investments, of his personality, determining its character. Here, by a bolder figure, they are viewed as an old self that had died and a new one that had come to life in its place (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The idea of a new man being born into a new life in baptism was already familiar to the Jews in their baptism of proselytes (see Lightfoot, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3.htm">John 3</a>.); and our Lord, discoursing to Nicodemus of the new birth, supposes him to understand the figure; but he teaches him that the change thus expressed should be no mere change of profession and habits of life, but a radical inward change, which could only be wrought by the regenerating Spirit. Such a change St. Paul teaches to be signified by Christian baptism; not only deliverance from condemnation through participation in the benefits of the death of Christ, but also the birth or creation of a new self corresponding to his risen body, which will not be, like the old self, under the thraldom of sin. "The body of sin" may be taken as meaning much the same as "our old man;" sin being conceived as embodied in our former selves, and so possessing them and keeping them in bondage. It certainly does not mean simply our bodies as distinct from our souls, so as to imply the idea that the former must be macerated that the latter may live. The asceticism inculcated elsewhere in the New Testament is in no contradiction to the ideal of <span class="accented">mens sana in corpore sano.</span> Our former sin-possessed and sin-dominated personality being now crucified with Christ, dead, and done away with, we are no longer, in our new personality, in slavery to sin, and are both bound and able to renounce it; "for he that hath died is freed [<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, literally, 'is justified'] from sin." In Scotland, one who is executed is said to be <span class="accented">justified</span>, the idea apparently being that he has satisfied the claims of law.

Thus <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>, where the two are conceived as forming one organism, so that the material ministries which are predicated of the one are predicated of the other, and the meanings of the two merge into one another.<p>In Paul it can scarcely be said to be used of a dead body, except in a figurative sense, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>, or by inference, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>.

Not the body as containing the principle of evil in our humanity, since Paul does not regard sin as inherent in, and inseparable from, the body (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19</a>), nor as precisely identical with the old man, an organism or system of evil dispositions, which does not harmonize with <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-12.htm">Romans 6:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>, where Paul uses body in the strict sense. "Sin is conceived as the master, to whom the body as slave belongs and is obedient to execute its will. As the slave must perform his definite functions, not because he in himself can perform no others, but because of His actually subsistent relationship of service he may perform no others, while of himself he might belong as well to another master and render other services; so the earthly &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; body belongs not of itself to the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; sin, but may just as well belong to the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13</a>), and doubtless it is de facto enslaved to sin, so long as a redemption from this state has not set in by virtue of the divine Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a> : Dickson).<p>continued...</body></html>
