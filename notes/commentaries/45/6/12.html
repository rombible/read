Therefore expel sin, and refuse to obey its evil promptings. Keep your bodies pure and clean. Let them no longer be weapons in the hands of wickedness; let them rather be weapons with which to fight the battle of righteousness and of God. You have every encouragement to do this. For sin shall no longer play the tyrant over you. The stern and gloomy Empire of Law (which only served to heighten the guilt of sin) is over, and in its stead the only power to which you are subject is that of free forgiveness.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">Mortal.</span>—And therefore at variance with the immortal life just described.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/romans/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-12.htm" title="Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the lusts thereof....">Romans 6:12-14</a>. </span><span class="ital">Let not sin </span>— Any sinful disposition or inclination; <span class="ital">therefore</span> — Since you are regenerate and spiritually alive; <span class="ital">reign in your mortal body</span> — That is, reign in your soul while it dwells in your body. Many of our sinful inclinations have their seat in the body, and such evil inclinations as are of a more spiritual nature, are always some way more or less turned toward the body. <span class="ital">That ye should obey it </span>— Should yield to and be overcome by it; <span class="ital">in the lusts thereof </span>— In the irregular or inordinate desires which it excites within you. <span class="ital">Neither yield ye your members </span>— The members of your bodies, or the faculties of your minds; the word <span class="greekheb">μελη</span>, here used, as also chapter <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm" title="For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death.">Romans 7:5</a>, signifying both, and indeed every thing in us and belonging to us, which is employed as an instrument in performing the works of the flesh, enumerated <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,...">Galatians 5:19-21</a>. For some of these do not require the members of the body to their being performed, but are wholly confined in their operation to the mind. Hence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>, <span class="ital">evil desire </span>and <span class="ital">covetousness </span>are mentioned among our members upon the earth which we are to mortify. <span class="ital">As instruments of unrighteousness </span>— Employed in its service; <span class="ital">unto sin </span>— For the committing of it. The original word <span class="greekheb">οπλα</span>, rendered <span class="ital">instruments, </span>properly denotes military weapons; and may be here used to signify, that those who employ their powers, whether of body or mind, or any ability they possess, in the service of sin, do in fact fight for it, and for its master and father, Satan; and the principalities and powers under his command, against God and Christ, and all the company of heaven. <span class="ital">But yield yourselves unto God </span>— Your lawful king, governor, and captain: dedicate yourselves, both body and soul, to his service; <span class="ital">as those that are alive from the dead </span>— Who, after having been spiritually dead, are quickened and put in possession of spiritual life; that is, are no longer alienated from the life of God, but have vital union with God; not as formerly, <span class="ital">carnally minded, which is death, </span>but <span class="ital">spiritually minded, which is life and peace, </span>chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-6.htm" title="For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.">Romans 8:6</a>; no longer under condemnation to the second death, but justified and entitled to eternal life; <span class="ital">and your members </span>— All your powers and abilities; <span class="ital">as instruments of righteousness </span>— Instruments employed in the promotion of piety and virtue; <span class="ital">unto God </span>— For his service and to his glory; or as <span class="ital">weapons, </span>to fight his battles, and oppose the designs of your spiritual enemies. <span class="ital">For sin shall not have dominion over you </span>— It has no right, and shall not have power to reign over you. The word <span class="greekheb">κυριευσει</span>, denotes the government of a master over his slave, and might be rendered, <span class="ital">shall not lord it over you. </span>As if he had said, Though it is true sin is strong, and you are weak in yourselves, yet if you faithfully strive against it, looking to God for power from on high, you shall be enabled to conquer. <span class="ital">For ye are not under the law </span>— Under a dispensation of terror and bondage, which only shows you your duty, but gives you no power to perform it; and which condemns you for your past violations of it, but offers no pardon to any on their repentance. The Mosaic law seems to be particularly intended, and the propriety of what is here observed is well illustrated, in that view, by the apostle in the next chapter. But his words may well imply also, that we are not so under any law as to be utterly condemned for want of a perfect conformity, or unsinning obedience to it. Not under a dispensation that requires such an obedience, under the penalty of death; which offers no assistance for enabling those who are under it to perform its requisitions, and grants no pardon to any sinner on his repentance. For the apprehension of being under such a dispensation would tend utterly to discourage us in all our attempts to conquer sin, and free ourselves from its power. <span class="ital">But under grace </span>— Under the merciful dispensation of the gospel, which offers to all that will accept it, in the way of repentance toward God and faith in Christ, a free and full pardon for all that is past, an entire change of nature, and those continual supplies of grace, which strengthen human weakness, and confer both the will and the power to conquer every besetting sin, and live in the practice of universal holiness and righteousness. For the nature of the grace, that is, of the new gracious covenant, under which we are placed, is such, that it does not require an impossible perfect obedience to the law of Moses, or any law, but the obedience of faith; promising, at the same time, the aids of the Holy Spirit, to enable men to do God’s will sincerely as far as they know it, and offering the pardon of sin to all on condition of repentance and faith in Christ, and in the declarations and promises of the gospel through him. Now under this gracious covenant mankind have been placed ever since the fall; ever since God said, <span class="ital">The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent’s head; </span>ever since that time the apostle’s doctrine here, <span class="ital">Ye are not under the law, but under grace, </span>has been true of all the posterity of Adam; a doctrine which, instead of weakening the obligation of the law of God, written on men’s hearts, or the moral law in any of its requirements, establishes it in the most effectual manner. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith?

Being made free from the reign of sin, alive unto God, and having the prospect of eternal life, it becomes believers to be greatly concerned to advance thereto. But, as unholy lusts are not quite rooted out in this life, it must be the care of the Christian to resist their motions, earnestly striving, that, through Divine grace, they may not prevail in this mortal state. Let the thought that this state will soon be at an end, encourage the true Christian, as to the motions of lusts, which so often perplex and distress him. Let us present all our powers to God, as weapons or tools ready for the warfare, and work of righteousness, in his service. There is strength in the covenant of grace for us. Sin shall not have dominion. God's promises to us are more powerful and effectual for mortifying sin, than our promises to God. Sin may struggle in a real believer, and create him a great deal of trouble, but it shall not have dominion; it may vex him, but it shall not rule over him. Shall any take occasion from this encouraging doctrine to allow themselves in the practice of any sin? Far be such abominable thoughts, so contrary to the perfections of God, and the design of his gospel, so opposed to being under grace. What can be a stronger motive against sin than the love of Christ? Shall we sin against so much goodness, and such love?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let not sin therefore - This is a conclusion drawn from the previous train of reasoning.

The "body" is here viewed as the instrument by which all the sins of the heart become facts of the outward life, and as itself the seat of the lower appetites; and it is called "our mortal body," probably to remind us how unsuitable is this reign of sin in those who are "alive from the dead." But the reign here meant is the unchecked dominion of sin within us.

Since grace reigns in you, sin should not: seeing ye are dead to sin, are baptized into the death of Christ, and are dead with him, and alive through him, sin therefore should not reign in you, and over you. This exhortation does not suppose a freewill power in man naturally, for this is spoken to persons, who had the Spirit and grace of Christ, and in whom God had wrought both to will and to do of his good pleasure; nor is this exhortation unnecessary to believers, though they are dead to sin, and though God has promised it shall not have the dominion over them, and though reigning sin, as divines say, cannot be in regenerate persons; for though they are entirely dead to sin as justified persons, yet not perfectly so as sanctified: they are indeed dead to sin, but sin is not dead in them; it struggles, it makes war, leads captive, and threatens absolute and universal dominion, wherefore such an exhortation is necessary; besides, though God has promised that sin shall not have the dominion, yet making use of means, such as prayer to God that it may not, striving against it, opposing it, in order to hinder its dominion, are no ways inconsistent with the promise of God, whose promises often have their accomplishment in the use of means: moreover, whereas some divines say, that reigning sin may be and others that it cannot be in regenerate persons, it should be observed, that if by reigning sin is meant, sinning against God out of malice and contempt, with the whole heart, without any struggle against it, or repentance for it, or so as to lose the grace of God, and never rise more, then it must be said that it cannot be in a regenerate man; but if by it is meant, falling into sin against their consciences, knowingly and willingly, so as to distress their minds, lose their peace, and grieve the Spirit of God, so as to be held under it, and be led captive by it, such power sin may have in them, and over them; and therefore the exhortation is not needless; and when the apostle says, let it not reign "in your mortal body", by it is either meant the whole man, or rather the body only, which is the instrument of sinning, and is become mortal through sin; and being so, is a reason why it should not reign in it, since it has done so much mischief to it already: and this also denotes the time of sin's being in us, and of the danger of its reigning in us; it is only whilst we are in this mortal body; and the consideration of our mortality should quicken us to war against sin, and be careful not to <p>obey it in the lusts thereof; the lusts of the body, or flesh, which are therefore sometimes called fleshly lusts, are many, and have great power and influence; and may be said to be obeyed, when provision is made to fulfil them, when these are the business of a man's life, and the whole of his conversation is taken up in them, without struggle against them, or opposition to them; and heroin lies the reign of sin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Let not sin therefore <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</span><p>(6) An exhortation to contend and strive with corruption and all the effects of it.<p>(o) By reigning Paul means that principal and high rule which no man strives against, and even if anyone does, it is in vain.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-12.htm" title="Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the lusts thereof.">Romans 6:12</a> f. <span class="greekheb">Οὖν</span>] in consequence of this <span class="greekheb">λογίζεσθε</span>, for the proof of it in the practice of life.

Schott thinks). As to <span class="greekheb">θνητῷ</span>, every explanation is to be avoided which takes the word in any other sense than the ordinary one of <span class="ital">mortal</span> (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a>), because it has no other signification (see all the examples in Wetstein), and because the context contains nothing at all in favour of giving any other turn to the notion of the word. We must reject therefore the opinion that it is equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΕΚΡῷ</span></span></span>, as taken in the ethical sense: dead <span class="ital">for sin</span> (Turretin, Ch. Schmidt, Ernesti, Schleusner, Schrader, and Stengel). Directly affirmed of the body, the mortality could not but be understood by every reader quite definitely as the <span class="ital">physical</span>. The <span class="ital">purpose</span> of the epithet however must manifestly result from the relation <span class="ital">of motive</span>, in which the mortality of the body stands to the prohibition of the reign of sin in the body. And the more precise definition of this motive is to be derived from the previous <span class="greekheb">νεκροὺς μὲν τῇ ἁμαρτιᾷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ζῶντας δὲ τῷ Θεῷ</span>. If we are convinced, namely, that we are dead for sin and alive for God; if we account ourselves as those who have put off the ethical mortality (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς ἘΚ ΝΕΚΡῶΝ ΖῶΝΤΑς</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm" title="Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.">Romans 6:13</a>), then it is <span class="ital">an absurdity</span> to allow sin to reign in the body, which in fact is <span class="ital">mortal</span>. This quality stands in a relation of <span class="ital">contradiction</span> to our <span class="ital">immortal</span> life entered upon in the fellowship of Christ, and thus the dominion, for which we should deliver over our body to sin, would prove that we were not that for which, nevertheless, in genuine moral self-judgment, we have to take ourselves; since in fact the mortal life of the body, if we yield it to the government of sin, excludes the immortal Christian life described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a>. Hofmann imports more into the passage than its connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-11.htm" title="Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:11</a> suggests; namely the double folly, that such an one should not use the <span class="ital">power</span>, which the life of Christ gives him over the mortal body and therewith over sin; and that he should permit himself <span class="ital">to be entangled in the death</span> to which his body falls a victim, while he possesses a life of which also his body would become joint-participant. This is a finespun <span class="ital">application</span> of the true interpretation. Different is the view of Köllner (comp Calvin: “per <span class="ital">contemtum</span> vocat mortale”), that it is here hinted how <span class="ital">disgraceful</span> it is to make the <span class="ital">spirit</span> subordinate to sin, <span class="ital">which only dwells in the perishable body</span>; and of Grotius: “de vita altera cogitandum, nee formidandos <span class="ital">labores haud sane diuturnos</span>” (comp Chrysostom and Theodoret; so also on the whole Reiche). But the context contains neither a contrast between body and spirit, nor between this and the other life. Flatt thinks that Paul wished to remind his readers of the <span class="ital">brevity of sensual pleasure</span>; comp Theophylact. But how little would this be in keeping with the high standpoint of the moral sternness of the Apostle! According to others, Paul desired to remind them warningly of the <span class="ital">destructiveness</span> of sin, which had brought death on the body (de Wette, Krehl, Nielsen, Philippi, also Maier). But this point of view as to destructiveness is remote from the connection, in which the pervading theme is rather the <span class="ital">unsuitableness</span> of the dominion of sin to the communion of death and life with Christ. Others still explain it variously.[1442]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΏΜΑΤΙ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">body</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>; not a symbolic expression for the entire ego (Reiche, following Ambrosiaster and various early expositors); nor yet body <span class="ital">and soul</span>, so far as it is not yet the recipient of the Spirit of God (Philippi); for even in all such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm" title="For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm" title="And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a> <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> retains purely its signification <span class="ital">body</span>.
