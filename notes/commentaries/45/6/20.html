The apostle rejoiced now they obeyed from the heart the gospel, into which they were delivered as into a mould. As the same metal becomes a new vessel, when melted and recast in another mould, so the believer has become a new creature. And there is great difference in the liberty of mind and spirit, so opposite to the state of slavery, which the true Christian has in the service of his rightful Lord, whom he is enabled to consider as his Father, and himself as his son and heir, by the adoption of grace. The dominion of sin consists in being willingly slaves thereto, not in being harassed by it as a hated power, struggling for victory. Those who now are the servants of God, once were the slaves of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/romans/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye were free from righteousness - That is, in your former state, you were not at all under the influence of righteousness. You were entirely devoted to sin; a strong expression of total depravity. It settles the question; and proves that they had no native goodness. The argument which is implied here rather than expressed is, that now they ought to be equally free from sin, since they had become released from their former bondage, and had become the servants of another master. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/romans/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

The import of it seems clearly to be this:&#8212;"Since no servant can serve two masters, much less where their interests come into deadly collision, and each demands the whole man, so, while ye were in the service of Sin ye were in no proper sense the servants of Righteousness, and never did it one act of real service: whatever might be your conviction of the claims of Righteousness, your real services were all and always given to Sin: Thus had ye full proof of the nature and advantages of Sin's service." The searching question with which this is followed up, shows that this is the meaning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/romans/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> q.d. When you served sin, you knew that God and righteousness had no whit of your service; why then should sin have any of your service now, when ye have delivered up yourselves to righteousness, or godliness, to be the observant followers thereof?

This is an argument used, or a reason given, why regenerate persons should be diligent in the service of righteousness; because when they were employed in the drudgery of sin, they <p>were free from righteousness; they had no righteousness, nor were they desirous of any; yea, averse to it, threw off the yoke of the law of righteousness, and lived in a very unrighteous manner: hence may be observed what is the free will of man in an unregenerate state; not free to, but "from" righteousness; free enough to evil, but from all that is good; and also what obligation lies upon believers, who are delivered from the bondage of corruption, and the servitude of sin, to a life and service of righteousness; inasmuch as they were before free from it, and unconcerned about it, but are now made by the grace of God free to it, they ought therefore cheerfully to pursue it, and neglect no opportunity of performing it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/romans/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> free from righteousness.</span><p>(t) Righteousness had no rule over you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/romans/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-20.htm" title="For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness....">Romans 6:20-22</a>.

What leads at last to death, could bring you no moral gain. For the grammatical explanation <span class="greekheb">ἐκείνων</span> is to be supplied before <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ οἷς</span> (which in fact is perfectly regular, Winer, p. 149 [E.

But how could the reader think of such <span class="ital">enjoyments</span> without any hint being given by the text? And how arbitrary in this particular place is that interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span>, especially when the verb itself is compounded with <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span>, and that in the sense: to be ashamed <span class="ital">thereupon</span>, and accordingly indicates how <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ οἷς</span> is to be resolved and properly understood! See generally on <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> with the dative, as specifying the ground with verbs of emotion, Kühner, II. 1, p. 436, and with <span class="greekheb">αἰσχύν</span>. II. 2, p. 381, rem. 6. Many others (Syriac, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Melancthon, Erasmus Schmid, Heumann, Carpzov, Koppe, Tholuck undecidedly, Rückert, Köllner, de Wette, Olshausen, Baumgarten-Crusius, Lachmann, Tischendorf, Philippi, Reithmayr, Ewald, van Hengel, and Th. Schott) end the question with <span class="greekheb">τότε</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ οἷς νῦν ἐπαισχ</span>. becomes the answer, of which again <span class="greekheb">τὸ γὰρ τέλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ θάν</span>. is the proof: “<span class="ital">what sort of fruit had ye then? Things</span> (ye had as fruit) <span class="ital">of which ye are now ashamed; for the end of them is death</span>.” <span class="greekheb">Καρπόν</span> is likewise regarded as a figurative description either of <span class="ital">gain</span> or <span class="ital">reward</span> (“ignoble and pernicious joys and pleasures,” Ewald), or of <span class="ital">actions</span>, which are the penal consequence of reprobate sentiments. But fatal to all this explanation, which breaks up the passage, is the antithesis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-22.htm" title="But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.">Romans 6:22</a>, where the <span class="ital">having of fruit</span>, not its <span class="ital">quality</span>, is opposed to the preceding; if Paul had inquired in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-21.htm" title="What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.">Romans 6:21</a> regarding the <span class="ital">quality</span> of the fruit, he must have used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-22.htm" title="But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.">Romans 6:22</a> some such expression as <span class="greekheb">νυνὶ δὲ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἁγιασμὸν ἔχετε τὸν καρπὸν ὑμῶν</span>. Besides, we cannot well see why he should not have written either <span class="greekheb">τίνας καρπούς</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ᾧ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐκείνου</span>; he would by annexing the <span class="ital">plurals</span>, though these were in themselves admissible on account of the collective nature of <span class="greekheb">καρπός</span>, have only expressed himself in a fashion obscure and misleading. Finally, it is to be observed that he never attributes <span class="greekheb">καρπόν</span> or <span class="greekheb">καρπούς</span> to immorality; he attributes to it <span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19</a>), but uses <span class="greekheb">καρπός</span> only of the good; he speaks of the <span class="greekheb">καρπὸς του πνεύματος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>; of the <span class="greekheb">καρπὸς τοῦ φῶτος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-9.htm" title="(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)">Ephesians 5:9</a>; of the <span class="greekheb">καρπὸς δικαιοσύνης</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-11.htm" title="Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.">Php 1:11</a>; of the <span class="greekheb">καρπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔργου</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-22.htm" title="But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.">Php 1:22</a>; comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm" title="Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.">Romans 1:13</a>; in fact he <span class="ital">negatives</span> the idea of <span class="greekheb">καρπός</span> in reference to evil, when he describes the <span class="greekheb">ἔργα τοῦ σκότους</span> as <span class="greekheb">ἄκαρπα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-11.htm" title="And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.">Ephesians 5:11</a>; comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-14.htm" title="And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.">Titus 3:14</a>.

The most plausible objection to our explanation is this, that in accordance with it <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ οἷς νῦν ἐπαισχ</span>. becomes merely an incidental observation. But an incidental observation may be of great weight in its bearing on the matter in hand. It is so here, where it contains a trenchant argumentative point in favour of replying in a negative sense to the question. Calvin aptly says: “non poterat gravius exprimere quod volebat, quam appellando eorum conscientiam et quasi in eorum persona pudorem confitendo.” Compare also Chrysostom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκείνων</span>] <span class="ital">neuter</span>: those things, on account of which ye are now ashamed, the <span class="ital">pre-Christian sins and vices</span>.

There is here a deep and solemn irony, (if we may venture the word), which has some parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-3.htm" title="For the time past of our life may suffice us to have worked the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, parties, and abominable idolatries:">1 Peter 4:3</a>; q. d., “You had nothing to do with the righteousness of God; you were not justified before Him: therefore His righteousness had, as it were, nothing to do with you; it laid no <span class="ital">bond</span> of grateful love upon you.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/romans/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-20.htm" title="For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.">Romans 6:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τῆς ἁμαρτίας</span>, <span class="ital">of sin</span>) This case contains the emphasis of the sentence; <span class="ital">sin</span> had taken possession of you.—<span class="greekheb">τῇ δικαιοσύνῃ</span>, <span class="ital">to</span> [towards] <span class="ital">righteousness</span>) that is in respect of righteousness.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/romans/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness</span> (more literally, <span class="accented">to righteousness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ye were not in any bondage to righteousness). <span class="cmt_word">What fruit had ye then</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> when you were formerly slaves of sin) <span class="cmt_word">in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?, for the end of those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and made servants to God, ye have your fruit unto sanctification; and the end life eternal. For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of god is life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord</span>. The logical connection with the previous context of the above series of verses, beginning with ver. 20, as well as the sequence of thought running through them (intimated by the particles <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>), is not at once obvious. It seems to be as follows: the <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> in ver. 20 introduces a reason for the exhortation of ver. 19, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, etc. But ver. 20 is not in itself the reason, being only an introduction to the statement of it in the verses that follow. The drift of the whole passage seems to be this: Yield ye your members to the sole service of righteousness; <span class="accented">for</span> (ver. 20) ye were once in the sole service of sin, owning no allegiance to righteousness at all; <span class="accented">and</span> (ver. 21) what fruit had ye from that service? None at all; for ye know that the only end of the things ye did then, and of which ye are now ashamed, is death. <span class="accented">But</span> (ver. 22) your new service <span class="accented">has</span> its fruit: it leads to your sanctification now, and in the end eternal life. Authorities, however, both ancient and modern, are divided as to the punctuation, and consequent construction, of ver. 21. In the Vulgate and the Authorized Version (as in the interpretation given above) the stop of interrogation is placed after "ashamed;" the answer, <span class="accented">none</span>, being understood, and "for the end," etc., being the reason why there is no fruit The other way is to take the question as ending at "had ye then," and "those things whereof," etc., as the answer to it, and for the end, etc., as the reason why they are ashamed. Thus: "What fruit had ye then (when you were free from righteousness)? The works (or pleasures) of which you are now ashamed were the only fruit; you are ashamed of them now; <span class="accented">for their</span> end is death." The latter interpretation is defended by Alford on the ground that it is more consistent "with the New Testament meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which is 'actions,' the ' fruit of the man' considered as the tree, not 'wages' or 'reward,' the 'fruit of his actions.'" This is true. But, on the other hand, it may be argued that such use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> by St. Paul is always in a good sense; he usually regards <span class="accented">sin</span> as having no fruits at all; to the <span class="accented">fruit</span> of the Spirit is opposed, not any fruit of a different character, but <span class="accented">the works</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) of the flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19, 22</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a> (again in opposition to the <span class="accented">fruit of the Spirit</span>) he speaks of the <span class="accented">unfruitful</span> works (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">of</span> darkness. Thus the idea of ver. 21, understood as in the Authorized Version, seems closely to correspond with that of the passage last cited. "The things of which ye are now ashamed," in ver. 21, are "the works of darkness" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>; and in both places they are declared to have no fruit. Sin is a barren tree, and only ends in death. Cf. what was said above with respect to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 19. It is true, however, that the expression in the next chapter, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>), in opposition to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>, in some degree weakens the force of the above argument. We observe, lastly, on ver. 23, that to the "wages" of sin (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> , used usually to denote a soldier's pay) is opposed "free gift" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> for sin earns death as its due reward; but eternal life is not earned by us, but granted us by the grace of God. As to the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>, in ver. 22, it can be used without the need of any such apology as seems to be implied in ver. 19 (according to the meaning of the verse that has been preferred) for speaking of our becoming <span class="accented">slaves</span> to righteousness. For we do belong to God as his <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and to Christ, having been "bought with a price" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>); and St. Paul at the beginning of his Epistles often calls himself <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>). But it does not follow that our service should be the service of slaves; it may be a free, willing, enthusiastic obedience notwithstanding; we obey, not because we are under bondage to obey, but because love inspires us (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>, etc., "Because ye are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no longer a servant, but a son"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/romans/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Free from righteousness (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>An ambiguous translation.
