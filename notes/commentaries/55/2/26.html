Those taken in the snare of the devil are represented as not only captives in the snare of the devil, but as also helplessly wrapped in slumber.<p>The deadly peril of all “captives of sin” is here well painted. These unhappy ones, before they can free themselves from the toils of the evil one, must awake from the deep slumber in which they are wrapped: in other words, must first be <span class= "ital">conscious</span> of their awful danger.<p><span class= "bld">Who are taken captive by him at his will.</span>—These words have been variously interpreted by commentators. The meaning that, on the whole, seems most satisfactory, represents the captive to sin waking up from his deathly slumber and escaping the toils of the evil one, for the purpose of carrying out for the future the will of God. The rendering of the whole verse would be as follows: “<span class= "ital">And that they may recover</span> <span class= "ital">themselves out of the snare of the devil</span>—<span class= "ital">being held captive by him</span>—<span class= "ital">to do His</span> (God’s) <span class= "ital">will.</span>”<p>It must be remembered that the first pronoun in this sentence, “being held captive by him,” referred here to the devil, and the second pronoun in the sentence, “to do <span class= "ital">His</span> will,” referred here to God, are represented in the Greek by two distinct words: the first by <span class= "greekheb">αυ</span>̓<span class= "greekheb">του</span>͂, the second by <span class= "greekheb">ε</span>̓<span class= "greekheb">κει</span>́<span class= "greekheb">νου</span><span class= "ital">.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:22-26 The more we follow that which is good, the faster and the further we shall flee from that which is evil. The keeping up the communion of saints, will take us from fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness. See how often the apostle cautions against disputes in religion; which surely shows that religion consists more in believing and practising what God requires, than in subtle disputes. Those are unapt to teach, who are apt to strive, and are fierce and froward. Teaching, not persecution, is the Scripture method of dealing with those in error. The same God who gives the discovery of the truth, by his grace brings us to acknowledge it, otherwise our hearts would continue to rebel against it. There is no peradventure, in respect of God's pardoning those who do repent; but we cannot tell that he will give repentance to those who oppose his will. Sinners are taken in a snare, and in the worst snare, because it is the devil's; they are slaves to him. And if any long for deliverance, let them remember they never can escape, except by repentance, which is the gift of God; and we must ask it of him by earnest, persevering prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And that they may recover themselves - Margin, "awake." The word which is rendered "recover" in the text, and "awake" in the margin -  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  anane&#772;pso&#772;sin - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means, to become sober again, as from inebriation; to awake from a deep sleep, and then, to come to a right mind, as one does who is aroused from a state of inebriety, or from sleep. The representation in this part of the verse implies that, while under the influence of error, they were like a man intoxicated, or like one in deep slumber. From this state they were to be roused as one is from sleep, or as a man is recovered from the stupor and dullness of intoxication.<p>Out of the snare of the devil - The snare which the devil has spread for them, and in which they have become entangled. There is a little confusion of metaphor here, since, in the first part of the verse, they are represented as asleep, or intoxicated; and, here, as taken in a snare. Yet the general idea is clear. In one part of the verse, the influence of error is represented as producing sleep, or stupor; in the other, as being taken in a snare, or net; and, in both, the idea is, that an effort was to be made that they might be rescued from this perilous condition.<p>Who are taken captive by him at his will - Margin, "alive." The Greek word means, properly, to take alive; and then, to take captive, to win over <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>; and then, to ensnare, or seduce. Here it means that they had been ensnared by the arts of Satan "unto (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;  eis) his will;" that is, they were so influenced by him, that they complied with his will. Another interpretation of this passage should be mentioned here, by which it is proposed to avoid the incongruousness of the metaphor of "awaking" one from a "snare." It is adopted by Doddridge, and is suggested also by Burder, as quoted by Rosenmuller, "A. u. n. Morgenland." According to this, the reference is to an artifice of fowlers, to scatter seeds impregnated with some intoxicating drugs, intended to lay birds asleep, that they may draw the snare over them more securely. There can be no doubt that such arts were practiced, and it is possible that Paul may have alluded to it. Whatever is the allusion, the general idea is clear. It is an affecting representation of those who have fallen into error. They are in a deep slumber. They are as if under the fatal influence of some stupefying potion. They are like birds taken alive in this state, and at the mercy of the fowler. They will remain in this condition, unless they shall be roused by the mercy of God; and it is the business of the ministers of religion to carry to them that gospel call, which God is accustomed to bless in showing them their danger. That message should be continually sounded in the ears of the sinner, with the prayer and the hope that God will make it the means of arousing him to seek his salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. recover themselves&#8212;Greek, "awake to soberness," namely from the spiritual intoxication whereby they have fallen into the snare of the devil.<p>the snare&#8212;(Eph 6:11, "the wiles of the devil": 1Ti 3:7; 6:9).<p>taken captive by him at his will&#8212;so as to follow the will of "THAT" (the Greek emphatically marks Satan thus) foe. However, different Greek pronouns stand for "him" and "his"; and the Greek for "taken captive" means not "captured for destruction," but "for being saved alive," as in Lu 5:10, "Thou shalt catch men to save them unto life"; also there is no article before the Greek participle, which the English Version "who are taken captive," would require. Therefore, translate, "That they may awake &#8230; taken as saved (and willing) captives by him (the servant of the Lord, 2Ti 2:24), so as to follow the will of HIM (the Lord, 2Ti 2:24, or "God," 2Ti 2:25)." There are here two evils, the "snare" and sleep, from which they are delivered: and two goods to which they are translated, awaking and deliverance. Instead of Satan's thrall comes the free and willing captivity of obedience to Christ (2Co 10:5). It is God who goes before, giving repentance (2Ti 2:25); then the work of His servant following is sure to be crowned with success, leading the convert henceforth to "live to the will of God" (Ac 22:14; 1Pe 4:2).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And that they may recover themselves</span>; the Greek word ananhqwsin properly signifieth to awake out of a drunken sleep.

Or "awake", and come to themselves, and appear to be sober, and in their right mind: the metaphor is taken from drunken men, who are overcharged, and are not in their senses, and being stupified fall asleep; and like these are persons intoxicated with errors and heresies, who when their minds are enlightened, and they are convinced of their evil tenets, repent of them, come to themselves, and acknowledge the truth, and so escape <p>out of the snare of the devil; for as carnal lusts and pleasures are the snares and nets, in which Satan, who may be compared to a fowler, catches some; so errors and heresies are those with which he ensnares others: "who are taken captive", or "alive", <p>by him at his will; such are taken in his nets and snares, as creatures are taken alive, by fowlers, and huntsmen; and they are held fast, and become his captives, and his slaves, and do his will, being led by him to whatsoever he pleases; he works powerfully in them, and they readily comply with him, and obey his lusts. Though some understand this, not of the will of the devil, but of the will of God; and that the sense is, that such persons are held captive by Satan, as long as it is the pleasure of God, and no longer; when the prey is taken from the mighty, and the lawful captive is delivered; and so it is an encouragement to the ministers of the word to go on in instructing, hoping this may be the case. Others connect this phrase, "to his will" or "according to his will", as they differently render it, with the word, "recover": and then the meaning is, that such, repenting of their errors, might escape out of the snare of Satan, in which they were taken alive; that so they might do the will of God, by professing and holding fast his truths; or that their repentance, recovery, and escape out of Satan's snare and captivity, are according to the will of God, and his sovereign good pleasure. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-26.htm" title="And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.">2 Timothy 2:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνανήψωσιν</span> is to be connected with <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ ἐκείνου θέλημα</span>.

Winer, <span class="ital">Gr</span>. § 66, 2, p. 547.

But (1) St Paul’s use of the perfect passive participle, <span class="bld">held captive</span>, is very strongly in favour of a reference to <span class="ital">the final state</span> of ‘recovery,’ not to the previous state of ‘entanglement.’ The final clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm" title="If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work.">2 Timothy 2:21</a>, where this participle ends the sentence, expresses the final state of ‘the vessel unto honour.’ The final clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm" title="Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.">2 Timothy 3:5</a> where the false teachers are described, has the same participle to shew their permanent rejection of vital godliness. The final clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm" title="That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all good works.">2 Timothy 3:17</a>, where the man of God is described, is ended in the same weighty form, ‘for every good work in a state of perfect preparedness.’ Hence the force of the perfect participle (as distinguished from the aorist) required here is ‘that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, continuing in the state of willing captivity into which they have been brought,’ ‘held willing captives.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) St Paul’s use of the first pronoun here, rendered ‘by him,’ is strongly in favour of a reference to the ‘servant of the Lord.’ A certain person or thing is in his mind as his chief subject; and he refers to him or it after an interval, short or long, merely with this pronoun. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-16.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, and to the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.">1 Timothy 4:16</a>, ‘continue in them’—the words of the faith and of the good doctrine; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-1.htm" title="Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,">Titus 3:1</a>, ‘Put them in mind’—the aged men and women, the younger men and servants of ch. 2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-17.htm" title="And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;">2 Timothy 2:17</a>, ‘their word will eat’—‘those who strive about words,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-14.htm" title="Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.">2 Timothy 2:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) St Paul’s use of the preposition ‘unto’ for ‘into a state of,’ ‘into conformity with’ is strongly in favour of the last clause being intended to express the resulting state and condition; cf. ‘unto honour,’ ‘unto every good work,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm" title="If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work.">2 Timothy 2:21</a>; ‘unto full knowledge,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-25.htm" title="In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;">2 Timothy 2:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Render, therefore, <span class="bld">held willing captives henceforth by their deliverer</span> (the servant of the Lord) <span class="bld">to do the will of God</span>.

Here, therefore, the meaning is "having been captured and enslaved." <span class="cmt_word">By him</span> (margin), (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of course the devil, who had just been named as having ensnared them. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the will of him</span> (margin), (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The difficulty of the passage lies in the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which at first sight seems to indicate a different antecedent from the antecedent of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. This grammatical difficulty has led to the strange rendering of the R.V., and to the wholly unjustifiable intrusion into the text of the words, "the Lord's servant" and of "God," producing altogether a sentence of unparalleled awkwardness and grotesqueness, and utter improbability. But there is no real difficulty in referring <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to the same person as <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (meaning in both cases the devil), as in the passage from Plato's 'Cratylus,' cited by Huther, after De Wette, the cause of the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> being that St. Paul was at the moment emphasizing the fact of these captives being deprived of their own will, and made subservient to the will of another. The passage may be paraphrased: "If peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, so as to recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, after they had been led captive by him, so as to be no longer their own masters, but obliged to do his will."  The implied contrast is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, just as in the passage from the 'Cratylus,' p. 430 (vol. 4. p. 306, Bekker's edit.), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The full passage is <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Another example of the transition from <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7, 8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>, where there is a contrast between John as the witness and Christ as the true Light (compare, too, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> has the force of "not you, but he"). For the general turn of phrase, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>, "Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ," where <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>) corresponds to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. It should be noted further that the sentence is certainly rather a peculiar one, from the use of such uncommon words as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, and the mixture of metaphors. But the sense of the A.V. is fully borne out. The interpretation preferred by Bishop Ellicott is "they may recover themselves from the snare of the devil unto his will (viz.
