This it is which the Apostle will help others to win, regardless of any suffering it may cost him; then, with his mind full of the thoughts of the “eternal glory,” once more he addressed himself to Timothy. “Faithful is the saying, namely, if we be dead with him,” &c. It was as though he said, “Do you not remember that well-known watchword of our own faith, so often repeated among us in our solemn assemblies when the brotherhood meet together?” Many have supposed, from the rhythmical character of the clauses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2Timothy 2:11-13</a>, that this “saying” was taken from some most ancient Christian hymns, composed and used in the very earliest days of the faith; but whether or no this be the case, there is high probability that the words formed part of a liturgy in common use in the days of Timothy. If not as a hymn—which seems, on the whole, the most likely supposition—we can well conceive them as part of the tapestry of a primitive Christian liturgy, woven in like the introductory sentences in our morning and evening prayer, or like the “comfortable words” of the Communion Service. The expression “If we be dead with Him”—more accurately, <span class= "ital">If we died with Him</span>—is well explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-31.htm" title="I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our LORD, I die daily.">1Corinthians 15:31</a> : “I die daily.” The Apostle <span class= "ital">died</span> when he embraced the lot of daily death. The meaning is still further illustrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2Corinthians 4:10</a>, where we read how St. Paul and his companions were “always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus.” “He and his faithful companions (was Timothy, to whom he was then writing, to be ranked in this blessed company? ) had given themselves up to a life that involved exposure to sufferings, bitter enmity, cruel persecutions, even death; but if we be thus dead with Him, what matters it? How can we fear even that last agony man can inflict on us—physical death?—for <span class= "ital">death</span> with Him involves, surely, <span class= "ital">life</span> with Him too: that life endless, fadeless, full of glory, we know He is now enjoying, in the possession of which I, Paul, and some of us have even seen Him, face to face, eye to eye.

There is an awful solemnity, as Doddridge justly observes, in this charge, which plainly shows the great folly and mischief of striving about little controversies. Indeed, consequences such as those here referred to, are wont to flow from most religious disputes as they are commonly managed; so that they tend to nothing out to the subverting of the faith and morals of those who engage keenly in them. They ought therefore to be carefully avoided by all who desire to promote true piety and virtue, agreeably to the apostle’s direction.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-13 Let suffering saints remember, and look to Jesus, the Author and Finisher of their faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despised the shame, and is now set down at the right hand of the throne of God. We must not think it strange if the best men meet with the worst treatment; but this is cheering, that the word of God is not bound. Here we see the real and true cause of the apostle's suffering trouble in, or for, the sake of the gospel. If we are dead to this world, its pleasures, profits, and honours, we shall be for ever with Christ in a better world. He is faithful to his threatenings, and faithful to his promises.

Greek, "Faithful is the saying."<p>For&#8212;"For" the fact is so that, "if we be dead with Him (the Greek aorist tense implies a state once for all entered into in past times at the moment of regeneration, Ro 6:3, 4, 8; Col 2:12), we shall also live with Him." The symmetrical form of "the saying," 2Ti 2:11-13, and the rhythmical balance of the parallel clauses, makes it likely, they formed part of a Church hymn (see on [2496]1Ti 3:16), or accepted formula, perhaps first uttered by some of the Christian "prophets" in the public assembly (1Co 14:26). The phrase "faithful is the saying," which seems to have been the usual formula (compare 1Ti 1:15; 3:1; 4:9; Tit 3:8) in such cases, favors this.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It is a faithful saying:</span> see the notes on <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.">1 Timothy 1:15</a></span>, and <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-9.htm" title="This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.">1 Timothy 4:9</a></span>, where we had the same phrase. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For if we be dead with him:</span> we are said to be dead with Christ two ways: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

This may refer either to what goes before, that all things, all reproaches and sufferings, through the ministration of the Gospel, are endured for the elects' sake; and that shall certainly obtain salvation in Christ, and eternal glory, to which they are predestinated: or to what follows, which being of moment and importance, and difficult to be believed, as that death led to life, and sufferings were the way to the kingdom; the apostle prefaces it in this manner, affirming the truth of it, that it was sure and certain, and to be believed, and depended on as such. <p>For if we be dead with him; with Christ, as all his people are, by virtue of union to him; they are dead with him, he and they being one, in a legal sense; when he died, they died with him; being crucified with him, as their head and representative, their old man, their sins, were also crucified with him, being imputed to him, and laid upon him; and through the efficacy of his death, they became dead to sin, both to its damning and governing power, and so are planted together in the likeness of his death; so that as he died unto sin once, and lives again to die no more, they die unto sin, and are alive to God, and shall live for ever. Moreover, this, agreeably to what follows, may be understood of the saints dying for Christ's sake, and the Gospel, whereby they are conformed unto him, and feel the fellowship of his sufferings, and so may be said to be dead with him: and such may assure themselves of the truth of what follows, <p>we shall also live with him; as many as were crucified with Christ, and buried with him, rose with him from the dead, and were justified in him, as their head and representative; the free gift came on them to justification of life; and they that are dead to sin, through the efficacy of his death, live a life of sanctification, which they have from him, and is maintained and supported by him, and is to his glory; and they live a life of communion with him, in whose favour is life; and though they die, and for his sake, they shall rise again; and because he lives, they shall live also, even a life of glory, happiness, and endless pleasure. And this is part of the faithful saying, and to be believed, and is believed by the saints: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm">Romans 6:8</a>. Moreover, since the word "him" is not in the original text, and the elect are spoken of in the preceding verse, what if the sense should be this, this is true doctrine, and a certain matter of fact, if we and the elect of God die together in the same cause, and for the sake of Christ, and the Gospel, we shall live together in everlasting bliss and glory? <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_timothy/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:...">2 Timothy 2:11-13</a>. In order to arouse the courage of faith, Paul has been directing attention to the resurrection of Christ and to His own example; he now proceeds, in a series of short antithetical clauses, to set forth the relation between our conduct here and our condition hereafter. This he introduces with the words <span class="greekheb">πιστὸς ὁ λόγος</span>. The <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> following seems, indeed, to make the words a confirmation of the thought previously expressed, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-9.htm" title="This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.">1 Timothy 4:9</a> (Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Flatt, de Wette, Wiesinger, Plitt); but Paul only uses this formula to confirm a <span class="ital">general</span> thought. There is, however, no general thought in the preceding words, where Paul is speaking only of his own personal circumstances. Hence the formula must, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.">1 Timothy 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.">1 Timothy 3:1</a>, be referred here to what follows, and <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> explained by “namely” (so, too, van Oosterzee).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We cannot say for certain whether the sentences following are really strophes from a Christian hymn (Münter, <span class="ital">Ueber die älteste christliche Poesie</span>, p. 29, and Paulus, <span class="ital">Memorabilia</span>, i. 109) or not; still it is not improbable that they are, all the more that the same may be said of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a>. The first sentence runs: <span class="greekheb">εἰ συναπεθάνομεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ συζήσομεν</span>] <span class="greekheb">συν</span> refers to Christ, expressing fellowship, and not merely similarity. De Wette points us to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a> for an explanation of the thought; but the context shows that he is not speaking here of spiritual dying, the dying of the old man, which is the negative element of regeneration (against van Oosterzee), but of the actual (not merely <span class="ital">ideal</span>) dying with Christ. In other words, he is speaking of sharing in the same sufferings which Christ endured (so also Hofmann), and whose highest point is to undergo death. The meaning therefore is: “if we in the faith of Christ are slain for His sake;” comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Php 3:10</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.">Matthew 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-20.htm" title="Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord.

The aorist <span class="greekheb">συναπεθάνομεν</span> is either to be taken: “if we have entered into the fellowship of His death,” or it denotes the actual termination: “if we are dead with Him, we shall also live with Him.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συζήσομεν</span>, corresponding to <span class="greekheb">συναπεθάνομεν</span>, is not used of the present life in faith, but of the future participation in Christ’s glorified life (so, too, Hofmann); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-10.htm" title="Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.">1 Thessalonians 5:10</a>.—<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-12.htm" title="If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:">2 Timothy 2:12</a>.

We have here contrasted two crises, and two states in the spiritual life: <span class="greekheb">συναπεθάνομεν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀρνησόμεθα</span> point to definite acts at definite times; while <span class="greekheb">ὑπομένομεν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀπιστοῦμεν</span> indicate states of being, more or less prolonged.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰ συναπεθάνομεν καὶ συνζήσομεν</span>: The two verbs are coupled also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-3.htm" title="I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die and live with you.">2 Corinthians 7:3</a>; but the actual parallel in thought is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life....">Romans 6:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>. <span class="ital">We died</span> (aor., R.V.) with Christ at our baptism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>), which, as normally administered by immersion, symbolises our burial with Christ and our rising again with Him to newness of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>). The future, <span class="greekheb">συνζήσομεν</span>, must not be projected altogether into the resurrection life; it includes and is completed by that; and no doubt the prominent notion here is of the life to come; but here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-8.htm" title="Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:">Romans 6:8</a>, it is implied that there is a beginning of eternal life even while we are in the flesh, <span class="ital">viz</span>. in that newness of life to which we are called, and for which we are enabled, in our baptism.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_timothy/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. It is <span class="ital">a faithful saying</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">Faithful is the saying</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.">1 Timothy 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.">1 Timothy 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-9.htm" title="This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.">1 Timothy 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that you affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men.">Titus 3:8</a>. See note on the first passage and Appendix, E. To close the argument, this rhythmical, perhaps liturgical, strain is quoted. It is introduced by ‘for,’ as is the quotation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>. The R.V. by printing ‘For’ in the text and ‘for’ in the margin thus incline to regarding the conjunction as part of the quotation. If it be not part, it will still have quite a fitting sense, as often in classical Greek ‘indeed’ or ‘in fact’ gives a better translation than ‘for’; cf. Donaldson’s <span class="ital">Greek Grammar</span>, p. 605.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">For if we be dead with</span> him] Read, <span class="bld">For if we died with him</span>. It is most natural to refer this to the dying with Christ in Baptism, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-20.htm" title=" Why if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances,">Colossians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>, where the aorists are equally to be observed. This would be the thought in the original framing of such a Christian hymn as this may have been. But St Paul’s baptism was no old ceremony and out of date; he was ‘always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>; just as the English Prayer Book Service bids Christians after their baptism ‘die from sin, continually mortifying all evil and corrupt affections.’ Hence he can well use the phrase so as to cover his ‘hardship even unto bonds,’ and his ‘daily dying’ to ‘fill up the sufferings of Christ.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we shall … live with</span> him] in the ‘eternal glory.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_timothy/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2 Timothy 2:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συναπεθάνομεν</span>) The <span class="greekheb">σὺν</span> occurs thrice in the compound verbs here: viz. <span class="ital">with</span> Christ: <span class="greekheb">συναπεθάνομεν</span>, in the sense of the preterite, having respect to them that hope for life.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Faithful is the saying</span> for <span class="accented">it is a faithful saying</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">died</span> for <span class="accented">be dead</span>, A.V.
