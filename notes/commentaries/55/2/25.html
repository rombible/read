In <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10</a> we read how these pronounced heretics—no doubt the teachers and leaders of the school—were, after a first and second admonition, to be shunned, were to be left to themselves. These, however, were evidently to be dealt with in a different manner. Their treatment was to be a gentle one. Nothing is here said respecting a first and second admonition only; no hint is given that these are to be shunned. They are clearly not the same as those referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-10.htm" title="A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition reject;">Titus 3:10</a>, or above in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm" title="If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work.">2Timothy 2:21</a> of this chapter, where, again, separation is definitely urged.<p><span class= "bld">If God peradventure will give them repentance.</span>—The Greek original here also carries out what was said in the Note on the last clause, and may be rendered literally, <span class= "ital">if perchance at any time God might</span> <span class= "ital">grant to them</span> . . . This suggests a hope at least that at some time or other God’s grace would work in these “opposing” members of the congregation a change. The “repentance” here signifies an abandonment on the part of those erring Christians of that wrong course on which they had entered, and a return to the true Church of God and to the full knowledge of the gospel truth.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:22-26 The more we follow that which is good, the faster and the further we shall flee from that which is evil. The keeping up the communion of saints, will take us from fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness. See how often the apostle cautions against disputes in religion; which surely shows that religion consists more in believing and practising what God requires, than in subtle disputes. Those are unapt to teach, who are apt to strive, and are fierce and froward. Teaching, not persecution, is the Scripture method of dealing with those in error. The same God who gives the discovery of the truth, by his grace brings us to acknowledge it, otherwise our hearts would continue to rebel against it. There is no peradventure, in respect of God's pardoning those who do repent; but we cannot tell that he will give repentance to those who oppose his will. Sinners are taken in a snare, and in the worst snare, because it is the devil's; they are slaves to him. And if any long for deliverance, let them remember they never can escape, except by repentance, which is the gift of God; and we must ask it of him by earnest, persevering prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves - That is, those who embrace error, and array themselves against the truth. We are not to become angry with such persons, and denounce them at once as heretics. We are not to hold them up to public reproach and scorn; but we are to set about the business of patiently "instructing them." Their grand difficulty, it is supposed in this direction, is, that they are ignorant of the truth. Our business with them is, "calmly to show them what the truth is." If they are angry, we are not to be. If they oppose the truth, we are still calmly to state it to them. If they are slow to see it, we are not to become weary or impatient. Nor, if they do not embrace it at all, are we to become angry with them, and denounce them. We may pity them, but we need not use hard words. This is the apostolic precept about the way of treating those who are in error; and can any one fail to see its beauty and propriety? Let it be remembered, also, that this is not only beautiful and proper in itself; it is the wiseST course, if we would bring others over to our opinions. You are not likely to convince a man that you are right, and that he is wrong, if you first make him angry; nor are you very likely to do it, if you enter into harsh contention. You then put him on his guard; you make him a party, and, from self-respect, or pride, or anger, he will endeavor to defend his own opinions, and will not yield to yours. "Meekness" and "gentleness" are the very best things, if you wish to convince another that he is wrong. With his heart first, and then modestly and kindly show him "what the truth is," in as few words, and with as unassuming a spirit, as possible, "and you have him."<p>If God peradventure will give them repentance, ... - Give them such a view of the error which they have embraced, and such regret for having embraced it, that they shall be willing to admit the truth. After all our care in teaching others the truth, our only dependence is on God for its success. We cannot be absolutely certain that they will see their error; we cannot rely certainly on any power which argument will have; we can only hope that God may show them their error, and enable them to see and embrace the truth; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-18.htm">Acts 11:18</a>. The word rendered "peradventure," here - &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  me&#772;pote - means, usually, "not even, never;" and then, "that never, lest ever" - the same as "lest perhaps." It is translated "lest at any time," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-6.htm">Matthew 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>; "lest," Matt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-6.htm">Luke 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-29.htm">Luke 13:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-32.htm">Luke 15:32</a>; "et al.: lest haply," <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-12.htm">Luke 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-39.htm">Acts 5:39</a>. It does not imply that there was any CHance about what is said, but rather that there was uncertainty in the mind of the speaker, and that there was need of caution LesT something should occur; or, that anything was done, or should be done, to prevent something from happening.<p>It is not used elsewhere in the New Testament in the sense which our translators, and all the critics, so far as I have examined, give to it here - as implying A hope that God would give them repentance, etc. But I may be permitted to suggest another interpretation, which will accord with the uniform meaning of the word in the New Testament, and which will refer the matter to those who had embraced the error, and not to God. It is this: "In meekness instructing 'those that oppose themselves' (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  antidiatithemenous) 'lest' - &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  me&#772;pote - God should give them repentance, and they should recover themselves out of the snare of the devil," etc. That is, they put themselves in this posture of opposition so that they shall not be brought to repentance, and recover themselves. They do it with a precautionary view that they may not be thus brought to repentance, and be recovered to God. They take this position of opposition to the truth, intending not to be converted; and this is the reason why they are not converted. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. instructing&#8212;Greek, "disciplining," instructing with correction, which those who deal in "uninstructive" or "undisciplined questions" need (see on [2500]2Ti 2:23; [2501]1Ti 1:20).<p>those that oppose themselves&#8212;Greek, "oppositely affected"; those of a different opinion.<p>if &#8230; peradventure&#8212;Greek, "if at any time."<p>repentance&#8212;which they need as antecedent to the full knowledge (so the Greek for 'acknowledgment') of the truth" (1Ti 2:4), their minds being corrupted (2Ti 3:8), and their lives immoral. The cause of the spiritual ignorance which prompts such "questions" is moral, having its seat in the will, not in the intellect (Joh 7:17). Therefore repentance is their first need. That, not man, but God alone can "give" (Ac 5:31).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; </span> without passion better informing such as have sucked in an error, not reviling them, but gently instructing them, and labouring to convince them of their mistake; for all those who for a time may oppose the truth, are not such as never repent, nor do it out of malice or hatred, they may do it out of ignorance and weakness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; </span> and God may give them a power, and a heart to repent, and to acknowledge that truth, which they at present oppose; and although this must be God’s work, yet he doth it by ministers as his means and instruments, who are to use probable means in order to it; such are not railing and reviling, but meek instructions, and a kind and gentle behaviour to them.

To the truth; resist it and deny it; or contradict some other tenets and principles of theirs, or the Scriptures, which they themselves allowed to be the word of God, and the rule of faith and practice, and so are self-convinced and self-condemned. These are to be instructed, being ignorant, and in a tender and gentle manner, though very perverse and obstinate. <p>If God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth: repentance here designs a repentance of errors in principle, a change of mind upon conviction, and such as issues in a free and ingenuous confession, and acknowledgment of the truth before opposed; and such a repentance is the gift of God: it is he that opens the eyes of the understanding, and works conviction in the mind, and leads into all truth, as it is in Jesus; and induces men to repent of their errors, confess their mistakes, and own the truth; even as repentance of evil practices is not owing to the power of men, nor to the bare influence of means, but to the efficacious grace of God, it being a grant from him. And though this is not certain, that God will give repentance to such contradictors and blasphemers of his Gospel; yet as it is his will, that all his chosen ones should come to repentance, and that some of all sorts should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth; and seeing these things have been brought about under and by the ministry of the word, it is an encouragement to the ministers of the Gospel to continue their instructions in the manner here directed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In meekness instructing those that <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</span><p>(k) He means those who do not yet see the truth.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-25.htm" title="In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;">2 Timothy 2:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">τοὺς ἀντιδιατιθεμένους</span>: They who err from right thinking are to be dealt with as tenderly and considerately as they who err from right living. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a>, <span class="greekheb">καταρτίζετε τὸν τοιοῦτον ἐν πνεύματι πραΰτητος</span>.
