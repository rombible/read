Then their work would be the work of workmen tested by trial, and would be found to have stood the test. (Comp. here <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.">1Corinthians 3:10-15</a>, where the final testing of the work done by God’s workmen, such as Timothy, is spoken of in very clear, heart-searching language.) His own words in the First Epistle to the Corinthians were evidently in St. Paul’s mind when he wrote down this direction to Timothy.<p><span class= "bld">Rightly dividing the word of truth.</span>—Better rendered <span class= "ital">rightly laying out the word of truth.</span> The Greek word translated in the English version “rightly dividing,” literally signifies “cutting a straight line.” It seems most correct to regard it as a metaphor from laying out a road (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-6.htm" title="In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths.">Proverbs 3:6</a>, in the LXX. rendering, where the word is so used), “or drawing a furrow, the merit of which consists in the straightness with which the work of cutting, or laying out, is performed. The word of truth is, as it were, a road which is to be laid out straightly and truly.” So Ellicott. To affirm (see Alford and Huther-Meyer) that the notion of “cutting” had been gradually lost, and that the word already in the time of St. Paul signified simply “to manage rightly,” “to treat truthfully without falsifying,” and that the exact opposite is to corrupt or adulterate the Word of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2Corinthians 2:17</a>), seems premature. (Comp. Eur. <span class= "ital">Rhesus, </span>422, ed. Dindorf.)<p>In the third century, Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Stromata, </span>7), for instance, certainly uses the word in a sense in which the idea of “cutting” has been lost, when he writes <span class= "ital">orthotomia</span> (a substantive) as an equivalent for <span class= "ital">orthodoxia</span>—orthodoxy. It is not improbable that the use of the word here by St. Paul gave the word a fresh starting-point, and that gradually the original meaning passed out of sight.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.">2 Timothy 2:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Study to show thyself approved, </span>&c. — Greek, <span class="greekheb">σπουδασον σεαυτον δοκιμον παραστησαι τω Θεω</span>, literally, <span class="ital">be zealous, make haste, </span>or <span class="ital">diligently endeavour, to present thyself approved to God, </span>what ever men may judge of thee and thy services; <span class="ital">a workman that needeth not to be ashamed </span>— Either on account of unfaithfulness, unskilfulness, lukewarmness, negligence, or sloth; <span class="ital">rightly dividing the word of truth </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ορθοτομουντα</span>, literally, <span class="ital">rightly cutting up the word </span>— In allusion, as some think, to the action of the Jewish priests in dissecting the victims, and separating the parts in a proper manner, as some were to be laid on God’s altar, and others to be given to those who were to share in the sacrifices. Or rather, the metaphor may be taken from the distribution made by a steward in delivering out to each person under his care such things as his office and their necessities require; or to the action of one who carves at a table, and distributes meat to the guests, according to their ages, and their state of health. In this manner the apostle himself divided the word to the Corinthians, feeding them <span class="ital">with milk, </span>as <span class="ital">babes in Christ, </span>and <span class="ital">not with meat, </span>as not being then <span class="ital">able to bear it. </span>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat....">Hebrews 5:12-14</a>.

Thus those ministers handle it who duly explain and apply the whole gospel, so as to give each hearer his due portion.

But strifes of words destroy the things of God. The apostle mentions some who erred. They did not deny the resurrection, but they corrupted that true doctrine. Yet nothing can be so foolish or erroneous, but it will overturn the temporary faith of some professors. This foundation has two writings on it. One speaks our comfort. None can overthrow the faith of any whom God hath chosen. The other speaks our duty. Those who would have the comfort of the privilege, must make conscience of the duty Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, Tit 2:14. The church of Christ is like a dwelling: some furniture is of great value; some of smaller value, and put to meaner uses. Some professors of religion are like vessels of wood and earth. When the vessels of dishonour are cast out to be destroyed, the others will be filled with all the fulness of God. We must see to it that we are holy vessels. Every one in the church whom God approves, will be devoted to his Master's service, and thus fitted for his use.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Study to show thyself approved unto God - Give diligence <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-10.htm">2 Peter 2:10</a>, or make an effort so to discharge the duties of the ministerial office as to meet the divine approbation. The object of the ministry is not to please men. Such doctrines should be preached, and such plans formed, and such a manner of life pursued, as God will approve. To do this demands study or care - for there are many temptations to the opposite course; there are many things the tendency of which is to lead a minister to seek popular favor rather than the divine approval. If any man please God, it will be as the result of deliberate intention and a careful life.<p>A workman that needeth not to be ashamed - A man faithfully performing his duty, so that when he looks over what he has done, he may not blush.<p>Rightly dividing the word of truth - The word here rendered "rightly dividing," occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, "to cut straight, to divide right;" and the allusion here may be to a steward who makes a proper distribution to each one under his care of such things as his office and their necessities require; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-52.htm">Matthew 13:52</a>. Some have supposed that there is an allusion here to the Jewish priest, cutting or dividing the sacrifice into proper parts; others, that the allusion is to the scribes dividing the law into sections; others, to a carver distributing food to the guests at a feast. Robinson (Lexicon) renders it, "rightly proceeding as to the word of truth;" that is, rightfully and skillfully teaching the word of truth. The idea seems to be, that the minister of the gospel is to make a proper distribution of that word, adapting his instructions to the circumstances and wants of his hearers, and giving to each that which will be fitted to nourish the soul for heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

The Septuagint, Pr 3:6; 11:5, use it of "making one's way": so Bengel here takes Paul to mean that Timothy may make ready a straight way for "the word of truth," and may himself walk straight forward according to this line, turning neither to the right nor to the left, "teaching no other doctrine" (1Ti 1:3). The same image of a way appears in the Greek for "increase" (see on [2498]2Ti 2:16).

The sense is, rightly handling the word of God, and giving to all their portion. For their notion who would make the sense of it, cutting out a right way for others by thy example, because the word oryotomein sometimes signifies to cut a right way, it no way agreeth to the text, for whatever the verb signifies alone, he is meanly skilled in the Greek that knows not it cannot have that sense, being joined (as here) with ton logon thv alhyeiav, the word of truth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_timothy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Study to show thyself approved unto God,.... The Alexandrian copy reads, "to Christ"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-10.htm">Romans 16:10</a>. Not unto men, as pleasing them; for such who study to please men, are not the servants of Christ; and sometimes those that are approved to and by men, are disapproved of by God and Christ: but unto God, showing all fidelity and uprightness; speaking out the Gospel openly, and freely, with all sincerity, as in the sight of God; commending themselves to him, and to every man's conscience, by manifestation of the truth; and such will hear, "Well done, good and faithful servant" another day. <p>A workman that needeth not to be ashamed; the ministry of the word is a work, and it is a good work; and those that perform it aright are worthy of honour and esteem; and it requires industry, diligence, and application, and for which no man is sufficient without the grace of God; and those who are employed in it are workmen, workers together with God, and labourers in his vineyard: and such who are faithful and diligent ones, "need not to be ashamed"; such do not cause shame, neither in themselves nor in others, as false teachers do, who foam out their own shame, and as negligent ministers of the word, and such whose lives are not agreeable to the doctrines they preach; nor have they any reason to be ashamed, neither of the Gospel, which they preach, nor of their sufferings, which they endure for the sake of it, nor of their upright ministrations of the word; and as they are not afraid to suffer shame for the sake of Christ now, they will not be ashamed before him at his coming. <p>rightly dividing, or "cutting" <p>the word of truth; that is, the Scriptures of truth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a> which come from the God of truth, are concerning Christ, who is the truth, and are dictated and led into by the spirit of truth, and contain in them nothing but truth: to divide the word, is not merely to divide the text into its proper parts, though care should be taken that this be done aright; and some think that the allusion is to the verses of the Hebrew Bible, which are called  "divisions", sections, or cuttings, from the word  "to cut" or "divide", being cut or divided one from another; hence those that were employed in the law, and were conversant with the sacred writings, and exercised therein, were called , "cutters", or "dividers of the law" (e); and so  is one that is well versed in the Bible, and knows every part of it, and readily uses it, in speaking or writing; and such an one was Timothy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a> though I rather think the apostle refers to a wrong way of dividing the Scriptures by the Jews, to which he opposes the right dividing of them. They had used not only to take away a letter out of one word, and add it to another, and so expound the text, but to remove words in it, and make that which went before to go behind, and that which was behind to go before; and this they call a sharp knife, which  , "cuts and divides the Scriptures" (f): but this way, which his countrymen used, the apostle would not have Timothy, and other Gospel ministers, make use of; for this is not rightly to divide, but to mangle and tear in pieces the word of truth. Moreover, to divide the word of truth, or to cut it, is to cut it open, and dissect its several parts, and search and look into the inside and bottom of it, for to find out every truth contained in it, and lay them open to others; and may be, as some have thought, an allusion to the cutting open the sacrifices, and laying the parts of them aright, and in a decent manner: to which may be added, that since ministers of the Gospel are stewards, and who, when wise and faithful, give to everyone of the household their portion of meat in due season; the metaphor may be taken from such, and from masters and governors of families, who cut up the food, and distribute it to each, according to their age and appetite; and so the ministers of the Gospel are to distribute the spiritual food of the word to babes in Christ, and to grown Christians, according to their capacities, and suitable to their cases and circumstances, dividing to everyone what is proper for him: in short, one that divides the word of truth rightly, is, as the Vulgate Latin version renders it, one that "rightly handles"; or, as the Syriac version, that "rightly preaches the word of truth"; who gives the true sense of Scripture, does not pervert and wrest it, and take from it, or add to it; who points out the truth in it, and shows unto men the way of salvation, and plainly and faithfully preaches the Gospel contained in it, without keeping back anything that is profitable, but declares the whole counsel of God. This same Greek word is used by the Septuagint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a> where it answers to the Hebrew word  which signifies to direct the way, and make it plain; and may here design a plain and open interpretation of the word of God: and to answer these several characters in the text should be the studious concern of every Gospel minister; and study is necessary thereunto; it requires great care that a man take heed to himself, and to his doctrine; and great industry, diligence, and application, and much reading, meditation, and prayer. <p>(e) Vid.

The most reliable interpretation is to keep by the fundamental meaning of the word taken in a good sense: “who is not ashamed, because he has nothing to be ashamed of.” Bengel: cui tua ipsius conscientia nullum pudorem incutiat; de Wette, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, Plitt translate it simply: “who has nothing to be ashamed of.” Hofmann arbitrarily explains it as equivalent to: “of whom God is not ashamed,” a meaning suitable to the context only if <span class="greekheb">δόκιμος</span> be taken in the sense he maintains. The next words make the definition still more precise: <span class="greekheb">ὀρθοτομοῦντα τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας</span>] <span class="greekheb">ὀρθοτομεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἅπαξ λεγ</span>., is rightly explained by most as recte tractare (which is the actual translation of the Vulgate); but there is very great variety in the derivation of the notion.

De Wette (Wiesinger agreeing with him) maintains the latter; recte secare viam, <span class="greekheb">λόγον</span> being put for <span class="greekheb">ὁδόν</span>. Certainly <span class="greekheb">τέμνειν</span> is often joined with <span class="greekheb">ὁδός</span>, <span class="greekheb">κέλευθος</span>; but it does not follow that in <span class="greekheb">ὀρθοτομεῖν</span> by itself there is contained a reference to the way.[32] As little can we say that any other of the references is contained in it. The word in itself means: “cut rightly,” or, according to Pape: “cut straight, in straight direction;” then, the notion of <span class="greekheb">τέμνειν</span> falling into the background, as is often the case with <span class="greekheb">καινοτομεῖν</span>, it has the more general signification: “deal rightly with something so as not to falsify it.”[33]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hofmann’s explanation is curious: “cut straight through the word of truth, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> cut it, so that it is a straight cut, passing into the heart of it, whereas a slanting cut would not reach the inner part of the word of God, but only touch the outwork.” This explanation—apart from other reasons—is refuted by the fact that <span class="greekheb">ὀρθοτομεῖν</span> has not the signification: “cut through the middle point.” The Gloss. ordinar. explains it: secundum competentiam singulorum, ut: altis spiritualia, lac distribuere parvulis, so that Paul is directing Timothy to preach the word according to his hearers’ capacity of understanding. This is the meaning also according to Luther’s translation: “who rightly parts the word of truth;” but the thought is entirely foreign to the context.[34]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Chrysostom explains it by <span class="greekheb">τέμνειν τὰ νόθα καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐκκόπτειν</span>; so, too, Oecumenius; but this is unsuitable, for there is nothing false in the <span class="greekheb">λόγος τῆς ἀληθ</span>., and therefore nothing to be separated from it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The expositors are quite wrong who refer the expression to a life in accordance with God’s word = <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ὀρθότατα βιοῦν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The right interpretation makes it the simple opposite of <span class="greekheb">καπηλεύειν τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>.[35]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[32] De Wette, indeed, appeals to LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-6.htm" title="In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths.">Proverbs 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-5.htm" title="The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.">Proverbs 11:5</a>; but in these passages <span class="greekheb">ὁδόν</span> appears, and the verb, like the יִשֵׁר, has the transitive signification: “make straight, smooth.”—Nor does the passage in Eurip. Rhes. v. 422: <span class="greekheb">εὐδεῖαν λόγων τέμνων κέλευθον</span>, justify de Wette’s explanation. The possibility of substituting <span class="greekheb">λόγον</span> for <span class="greekheb">ὁδόν</span> is not proved simply by remarking that “the word is a way.” We certainly do speak of “walking in the path of the divine word, of virtue,” etc., but not of “walking in the divine word, in virtue.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[33] Perhaps the expression may be explained in this way, that the imparting of the <span class="greekheb">λόγος τῆς ἀληθείας</span> makes it necessary to part it, since only a part of it can be delivered each time; it therefore amounts to saying that this parting is to be done rightly, so that the <span class="greekheb">λόγος τῆς ἀληθείας</span> may receive no injury.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[34] In Beza’s explanation: nihil praetermittere, quod dicendum sit, nil adjicere de suo, nil mutilare, discerpere, torquere, deinde diligenter spectare, quid ferat auditorum captus, the first part alone is to the point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[35] In the Fathers the word <span class="greekheb">ὀρθοτομία</span> is sometimes found synonymous with <span class="greekheb">ὀρθοδοξία</span>. Clemens Alex. <span class="ital">Stromata</span>, vii. p. 762: <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀποστολικὴν ἐκκλησιαστικὴν σώζων ὀρθοτομίαν τῶν δογμάτων</span>; but this usage took its rise from the above passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.">2 Timothy 2:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">σπούδασον</span>: <span class="ital">Give diligence to present thyself</span> (as well as thy work) <span class="ital">to God, approved</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀνεπαίσχυντον</span>: Chrys. takes this to mean <span class="ital">a workman that does not scorn to put his hand to anything</span>; but it is better explained as <span class="ital">a workman who has no cause for shame when his work is being inspected</span>.

Theodoret explains it of a ploughman who drives a straight furrow. Similarly R.V. m. (1), <span class="ital">Holding a straight course in the word of truth</span>. Chrys., of cutting away what is spurious or bad. Alf. follows Huther in supposing that the idea of cutting has passed out of this word, as it has out of <span class="greekheb">καινοτομεῖν</span>, and renders, <span class="ital">rightly administering</span>, as opposed to “adulterating the word of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>). Other examples of words which have wholly lost their derivational meaning are <span class="greekheb">πρόσφατος</span> and <span class="greekheb">συκοφαντέω</span>. The imagery underlying the A.V., R.V.m.

The workman whose work is skimped is put to shame when, upon its being tested, it is found to be bad, dishonest work; the workman whose work, like himself, is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, honest, conscientious, good work, and moreover sound and skilful work, never has been, and never can be, put to shame.

Hence, to cut straight, as paths; to hold a straight course; generally, to make straight; to handle rightly. Vulg. recte tractare. The thought is that the minister of the gospel is to present the truth rightly, not abridging it, not handling it as a charlatan (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>), not making it a matter of wordy strife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-14.htm">2 Timothy 2:14</a>), but treating it honestly and fully, in a straightforward manner. Various homiletic fancies have been founded on the word, as, to divide the word of truth, giving to each hearer what he needs: or, to separate it into its proper parts: or, to separate it from error: or, to cut straight through it, so that its inmost contents may be laid bare. Others, again, have found in it the figure of dividing the bread, which is the office of the household steward; or of dividing the sacrificial victims; or of cutting a straight furrow with the plough. </body></html>
