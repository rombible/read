This is opposed to our being strong in our own strength. All Christians, but especially ministers, must be faithful to their Captain, and resolute in his cause. The great care of a Christian must be to please Christ. We are to strive to get the mastery of our lusts and corruptions, but we cannot expect the prize unless we observe the laws. We must take care that we do good in a right manner, that our good may not be spoken evil of. Some who are active, spend their zeal about outward forms and doubtful disputations. But those who strive lawfully shall be crowned at last. If we would partake the fruits, we must labour; if we would gain the prize, we must run the race. We must do the will of God, before we receive the promises, for which reason we have need of patience. Together with our prayers for others, that the Lord would give them understanding in all things, we must exhort and stir them up to consider what they hear or read.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou therefore - In view of the fact stated in the previous chapter, that many had turned away from the apostle, and had forsaken the paths of truth.<p>Be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus; - compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10</a>.

The illative particle, "therefore", shows the connection between this and the preceding chapter; the appellation, "thou, my son", expresses the apostle's tender affection for Timothy, and is the rather used to engage his attention to the advice he was about to give him; which is, that since he had received the true grace of God, and unfeigned faith dwelt in him; and since he had such gifts, qualifying him for the work of the ministry; and since so good a thing as the glorious Gospel of the blessed God was committed to his trust; and since there were so many who had departed from it, and so few that abode by it, he would have him <p>be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus; by which may be meant either the free favour and love of God in Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-39.htm">Romans 8:39</a> which is in itself always strong, immovable, and unalterable; and is the strength and security of the saints, though they have not always the same strong believing views of it; and to be strong in it, is to be rooted and grounded in it, and to have a strong sense and firm persuasion of interest in it, and that nothing can separate from it: or else the Gospel, which is a declaration of grace, and is in Christ, and comes by him; and to be strong in it, is to preach it boldly, to defend it bravely, and courageously oppose every error and heresy, and every abettor thereof; and it also becomes every private believer to hold it fast, stand fast in it, abide by it, and earnestly contend for it; and so the phrase may stand opposed to , or  "one strong in the law", which is so often used by the Jews (d): or rather by grace is meant the fulness of grace which is in Christ, for the supply of his people; for in that grace which is in him, and not in that which is in themselves, should their dependence be. It is very agreeable to be strong in grace received, in point of exercise, but not in point of contentment; so as to rest satisfied with the present measure of it, without growing in it, and going on to perfection; and much less in point of consolation, so as to derive peace and comfort from it; and still less in point of trust and confidence in it; for it is but a creature, though a very glorious one, being the workmanship of God, and very variable as to its exercise, and as yet imperfect; and not that, but the object of it, is to be trusted in: though indeed a person's enjoyment of everlasting glory and happiness may be strongly concluded from the work of grace which is begun in him; that being an immortal seed, and a well of living water springing up into eternal life; and with which glory is inseparably connected. But grace in Christ is what believers should always have recourse unto, and exercise faith on; and not only believe that there is such a fulness of grace in Christ, which they have both heard of and seen, and which they know is laid up for them, and given to them, and is sufficient for them; but they should go forth out of themselves unto it, and draw water with joy out of the full wells of salvation in Christ: and this grace is of a strengthening nature, both to ministers of the word, to enable them to fulfil their ministry, to bear reproaches, afflictions, and persecution for the Gospel, and the infirmities of weak brethren; and to private believers, to strengthen them against every corruption, temptation, and snare, to exercise every grace, and discharge every branch of duty. <p>(d) Targum in Ruth ii. 1. &amp; in Psal. lxxxii. 1. &amp; cxii. 2. &amp; in Eccl. x. 17. &amp; in Cant. viii. 10, vid.

After interrupting his exhortations by an allusion to the unfaithful Asiatics and to the faithful Onesiphorus, Paul with <span class="greekheb">σύ</span> resumes his exhortations to Timothy, at the same time connecting them by <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> with those already given. In the first place, he now appeals to him: <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυναμοῦ ἐν τῇ χάριτι τῇ ἐν Χρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησ</span>.] <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυναμοῦσθαι</span> does not mean: “feel oneself strong,” nor: “depend on something” (Heydenreich); but: “become strong, grow strong” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>). The active voice is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm" title="Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.">2 Timothy 4:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-12.htm" title="And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;">1 Timothy 1:12</a>. As the apostle sees the end of his labours draw nearer, he is the more anxious that Timothy, for whom he has the warmest paternal love (<span class="greekheb">τέκνον μου</span>), should become a stronger and bolder champion for the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ χάριτι</span>] may either be a completion of the idea of <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυναμοῦ</span> (Wiesinger), or define it more precisely (van Oosterzee, Plitt, Hofmann). The second view is the correct one: Timothy is to become strong by the <span class="greekheb">χάρις ἡ ἐν Χρ</span>., that he may be capable of discharging faithfully the office entrusted to him; comp. the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-10.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.">Ephesians 6:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις ἡ ἐν Χρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>.] is not the office of teacher (Calovius and others), nor is it equivalent to <span class="greekheb">χάρισμα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm" title="Why I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you by the putting on of my hands.">2 Timothy 1:6</a>; on the other hand, it is not “the life imparted by divine grace,” nor “the redemption” of the Christian (Wiesinger); it is objectively the grace dwelling in Christ, the grace of Jesus Christ, or better: “the grace obtained for us in the person of Christ” (Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is explained by Chrysostom and others as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">διά</span>; this is not incorrect, only that <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> indicates a more internal relation than <span class="greekheb">διά</span>. The believer lives <span class="ital">in</span> the grace which is in Christ; the strengthening to which Timothy is exhorted can only be effected by his abiding in this grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-1.htm" title="You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 2:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">σύ</span>: emphatic, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-11.htm" title="But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.">1 Timothy 6:11</a> and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm" title="But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,">2 Timothy 3:10</a>; but the appeal is not primarily that Timothy should imitate Onesiphorus, or learn by the example of Phygelus and Hermogenes, but rather marks the intensity of the apostle’s anxiety for the future conduct of Timothy in the Church; and similarly <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> is resumptive of all the considerations and appeals for loyalty in chap. 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τέκνον</span>: See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-2.htm" title="To Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.">1 Timothy 1:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐνδυναμοῦ ἐν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: The thought is resumed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/1-8.htm" title="Be not you therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be you partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;...">2 Timothy 1:8-9</a>, and expanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ....">2 Timothy 2:3-13</a>.

Although the verb is passive, as indicated in the R.V., those who are, or who are exhorted to be, strengthened are not merely passive recipients of an influence from without. The act of reception involves man’s co-operation with God. Compare “Abide in me, and I in you” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm" title="Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me.">John 15:4</a>). The perfection of God’s power is conditioned by the weakness of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.
