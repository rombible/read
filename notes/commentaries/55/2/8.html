They were to be the foundation stones of his whole life’s work. Remembering these in the hour of his greatest trouble, he was never to be cast down, but ever to take fresh courage. And the two facts he was to remember were: that Jesus Christ, for whose sake he suffered—like him, Timothy, or like St. Paul—was born of flesh and blood, and yet He had risen from the dead. Surely, in the hour of his weakness, such a thought would be sufficient to inspire him with comfort and courage. Two facts, then, are to be ever in Timothy’s mind: the Resurrection and the Incarnation of his Lord. The thought of the first mentioned, “the Resurrection,” would always be reminding him of his Master’s victory over death and of His present glory. The thought of the second mentioned, “born of the seed of David,” “the Incarnation,” would ever be whispering to him, “Yes, and the risen and glorified One sprang, too, like himself, from mortal flesh and blood.” The reason of the “Incarnation” being expressed in this special manner, “born of the seed of David,” was to include another truth. The “risen One “was not only born of flesh and blood, but belonged to the very race specified in those prophets so revered by Timothy and the chosen people as <span class= "ital">the</span> race from which should spring the Messiah: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth . . . and this is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>). To raise the fainting heart of his much-tried disciple in this hour of discouragement, to supply a ground of confidence to yet unborn Christians, who in their day would be tried as Timothy was then, was the Apostle’s first purpose when he pressed these thoughts on his son in the faith; but in the background, no doubt, there lay another purpose. These great comforting truths were to be maintained and taught in the presence of those false teachers who were ever ready to explain away or even to deny, <span class= "ital">then as now, </span>the beginning and the end of the Son of God’s life and ministry on earth—His Incarnation and His Resurrection.<p><span class= "bld">According to my gospel.</span>—This formula, for so it may be considered, occurs frequently in St. Paul’s Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>, and again <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>, and in other places), and, with very slight variations, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm" title="According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.">1Timothy 1:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;">1Corinthians 15:1</a>. Jerome’s remark, “As often as St. Paul in his Epistles writes ‘<span class= "ital">according to my Gospel,</span>’ he refers to the volume of Luke,” although received with reserve by many expositors, considering the weighty traditional evidence we possess of St. Luke’s Gospel being in reality written by St. Paul, appears on the whole substantially correct.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-8.htm" title="Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:...">2 Timothy 2:8-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Remember </span>— So as to be encouraged against, and supported under, any sufferings which thou mayest be called to endure for the truth; <span class="ital">that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David </span>— According to the flesh; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm" title="For truly he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham.">Hebrews 2:16</a>; <span class="ital">was raised from the dead </span>— And thereby demonstrated himself to be the true Messiah. So our translators have rendered the clause, understanding the sense to be, Remember and adhere to this important fact, as the great foundation of the gospel. But the original expressions, <span class="greekheb">μνημονευε Ιησουν Χριστον εγηγερμενον εκ νεκρων</span>, are, literally, <span class="ital">Remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead, </span>&c.

The evils which he was suffering for the gospel, though great, he reckoned as nothing, because of the joy which he felt from his persuasion that the honour of Christ and the happiness of mankind would be promoted by his sufferings, and because he knew that all the opposition which infidels were making to the gospel, would not hinder it from being preached and believed. They have bound me in chains, said he, and may put me to death, but the word of God they cannot bind.

We must not think it strange if the best men meet with the worst treatment; but this is cheering, that the word of God is not bound. Here we see the real and true cause of the apostle's suffering trouble in, or for, the sake of the gospel. If we are dead to this world, its pleasures, profits, and honours, we shall be for ever with Christ in a better world. He is faithful to his threatenings, and faithful to his promises.

The idea seems not to be, as our translators supposed, that he was to reflect on the fact that he was raised from the dead; but rather that he was to think of the Saviour himself. "Think of the Saviour, now raised up from the dead after all the sorrows of this life, and let this encourage you to bear your trials." There is nothing better fitted to enable us to endure the labors and trials of this life, than to think of the Saviour. On the phrase "seed of David," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>.<p>According to my gospel - The gospel which I preach; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Rather as Greek, "Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead." Remember Christ risen, so as to follow Him. As He was raised after death, so if thou wouldest share His risen "life," thou must now share His "death" (2Ti 2:11). The Greek perfect passive participle, implies a permanent character acquired by Jesus as the risen Saviour, and our permanent interest in Him as such. Christ's resurrection is put prominently forward as being the truth now assailed (2Ti 2:18), and the one best calculated to stimulate Timothy to steadfastness in sharing Paul's sufferings for the Gospel's sake (see on [2495]2Ti 2:3).<p>of the seed of David&#8212;The one and only genealogy (as contrasted with the "endless genealogies," 1Ti 1:4) worth thinking of, for it proves Jesus to be the Messiah. The absence of the article in the Greek, and this formula, "of the seed of David" (compare Ro 1:3), imply that the words were probably part of a recognized short oral creed. In His death He assured us of His humanity; by His resurrection, of His divinity. That He was not crucified for His own sin appears from His resurrection; that He was crucified shows that He bore sin, on Him, though not in Him.<p>my gospel&#8212;that which I always taught.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle passeth from his former discourse, wherein he had armed Timothy against the afflictions of the gospel, to a discourse about the doctrine of the gospel; and here mentioneth two principal heads of that doctrine, the incarnation of Christ, and his resurrection, which he instanceth in, as more particularly to be remembered and pressed upon Christians, in regard they were those two points of the gospel which were either at that time denied, as that of the incarnation was by the Jews, or he knew would first be opposed; and the latter that which <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">declared Christ to be the Son of God with power, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a></span>, and upon a faith in which Christians’ salvation and consolation much depended, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-25.htm" title="Who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification.">Romans 4:25</a> 8:34</span>; he therefore calls to him especially to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">remember that Jesus Christ was of the seed of David, </span> truly man, and the true Messiah, who was to be the seed of David, (as the Jews themselves confessed): the manhood of Christ, soon after the apostle’s times, was denied by the Marcionites and Manichees, &c.

This is said either as an encouragement to suffer hardness in the cause of Christ; since he, who though he was of the seed of David, of the blood royal, and heir to his crown, yet suffered and died; and whereas he rose again from the dead, those who suffer for his sake shall rise also, and live and reign with him for ever: or else as a specimen of the form of sound words, or of the things which Timothy had heard of the apostle; for this, with what follows, is a summary of them: Christ being of the seed of David, according to the flesh, or human nature, is expressive of his incarnation; shows that he was really come in the flesh, and was truly man; and that he assumed human nature with all its frailties and infirmities, excepting sin, and was, like David, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with griefs; and it includes his whole life, and his righteousness, and obedience to the law of works, and points him out as the true Messiah, who was well known to the Jews by the name of the son of David. And now the apostle puts Timothy in mind, that he <p>was raised from the dead; which implies that he died; and so includes all the doctrines relating to his death; as that he died to make reconciliation, atonement, and satisfaction for the sins of his people, and to procure peace for them, and the full remission of all their iniquities; and to obtain redemption for them, from sin, Satan, the law, and its curses; as well as it expresses his resurrection from the dead, for their justification: and this being his first step to glory, has connected with it his ascension to heaven, session at the right hand of God, intercession for the saints, and his second coming to judgment; and is therefore particularly mentioned, because it is an article so comprehensive, and is a fundamental one, and of the greatest importance to faith, and was what was struck at in those times: the apostle adds, <p>according to my Gospel; meaning not the Gospel of Luke, in which there is a clear account given of the resurrection of Christ, said to be written by him, at the instigation, and under the direction of the apostle, and published with his approbation, as some think; but the doctrine of the Gospel, and which he calls his, not because he was the author, or the subject of it; for in these respects it is the Gospel of God, and of Christ; but because it was committed to him, and he was intrusted with it, and fully and faithfully preached it; and in distinction from another Gospel, that of the false teachers; and agreeably to this doctrine, which the apostle everywhere taught, Christ was raised from the dead; so the Ethiopic version renders it, "as I have taught". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</span><p>(6) He confirms plainly two principles of our faith, which are alway assaulted by heretics, the one of which (that is, that Christ is the true Messiah, made man of the seed of David) is the ground of our salvation: and the other is the highest part of it, that is, that he is risen again from the dead.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_timothy/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-8.htm" title="Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:">2 Timothy 2:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μνημόνευε Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν</span>] <span class="greekheb">μνημονεύειν</span> is usually followed by the genitive; but the accusative is found both here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>.

Heydenreich rightly rejected the secondary references which many expositors give to these words, such as: that they indicate a similarity between the vicissitudes of Christ’s life and those of David; or that they are to serve as a proof of the certainty of Christ’s resurrection (Michaelis); or that they denote the whole state of Christ’s humiliation (Mosheim), and so on.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The added words: <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸ εὐαγγέλιόν μου</span>, may be referred either to <span class="greekheb">μνημόνευε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

The latter reference is the more probable one; Paul, as a rule, does not use the formula <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸ εὐαγγ</span>. to denote the rule for the believer’s conduct, but to confirm a truth he has expressed (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm" title="According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.">1 Timothy 1:11</a>).

II. 1, pp. 113f.): “Timothy being disinclined to suffer for the gospel’s sake, the apostle reminds him that through death Jesus attained to the heavenly glory, to which He had a right through His descent from the line of David.”—Van Oosterzee incorrectly assumes that <span class="greekheb">ἐκ σπέρμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Δ</span>. simply denotes the <span class="ital">human</span> origin of Jesus.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, in the New Testament, usually governs the genitive case as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-9.htm">Matthew 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-5.htm">Revelation 18:5</a>, it has an accusative, as here, and commonly in classical Greek. There seems to be hardly sufficient ground for the distinction mentioned by Bishop Ellicott, that with a genitive it means simply "remember," with the accusative "keep in remembrance." It is more difficult to determine the exact force and intent of the clause, "of the seed of David." It seems, however, to point to Christ's human nature, so as to make the example of Christ's resurrection apposite as an encouragement to Timothy. And this view is much strengthened by <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, where the addition, "according to the flesh," as contrasted with "the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness," marks the clause, "of the seed of David," as specially pointing to the human nature of Christ. The particular form which the reference takes probably arises from the form to which the apostle refers us as "my gospel." In that creed, which was the epitome of the gospel as preached by St. Paul, there was no doubt mention made of Christ's Davidic descent. Others, as Huther, think the clause points to the Messianic dignity of David. Others that it is inserted in refutation of the Docetae, and to show the reality of the death and resurrection of Christ; or that it is meant to mark especially the fulfilment of prophecy. But the first explanation is quite satisfactory, and the general purpose of the reference to our Lord as intended to encourage Timothy to endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ, is fully borne out by the "faithful saying" in vers. 11 and 12, "If we died with him, we shall also live with him: if we endure, we shall also reign with him." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Remember that Jesus Christ - was raised, etc.<p>Incorrect.

See the parallel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, which the writer probably had in mind, and was perhaps trying to imitate.
