The age of children is the age to learn; and those who would get true learning, must get it out of the Scriptures. They must not lie by us neglected, seldom or never looked into. The Bible is a sure guide to eternal life. The prophets and apostles did not speak from themselves, but delivered what they received of God, 2Pe 1:21. It is profitable for all purposes of the Christian life. It is of use to all, for all need to be taught, corrected, and reproved. There is something in the Scriptures suitable for every case. Oh that we may love our Bibles more, and keep closer to them! then shall we find benefit, and at last gain the happiness therein promised by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the main subject of both Testaments. We best oppose error by promoting a solid knowledge of the word of truth; and the greatest kindness we can do to children, is to make them early to know the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That the man of God may be perfect - The object is not merely to convince and to convert him; it is to furnish all the instruction needful for his entire perfection. The idea here is, not that any one is absolutely perfect, but that the Scriptures have laid down the way which leads to perfection, and that, if any one were perfect, he would find in the Scriptures all the instruction which he needed in those circumstances. There is no deficiency in the Bible for man, in any of the situations in which he may be placed in life; and the whole tendency of the book is to make him who will put himself fairly under its instructions, absolutely perfect.<p>Thoroughly furnished unto all good works - Margin, "perfected." The Greek means, to bring to an end; to make complete. The idea is, that whatever good work the man of God desires to perform, or however perfect he aims to be, he will find no deficiency in the Scriptures, but will find there the most ample instructions that he needs. He can never advance so far, as to become forsaken of his guide. He can never make such progress, as to have gone in advance of the volume of revealed truth, and to be thrown upon his own resources in a region which was not thought of by the Author of the Bible. No new phase of human affairs can appear in which it will not direct him; no new plan of benevolence can be started, for which he will not find principles there to guide him; and he can make no progress in knowledge or holiness, where he will not feel that his holy counsellor is in advance of him still, and that it is capable of conducting him even yet into higher and purer regions. Let us, then, study and prize the Bible. It is a holy and a safe guide. It has conducted millions along the dark and dangerous way of life, and has never led one astray. The human mind, in its investigations of truth, has never gone beyond its teachings; nor has man ever advanced into a region so bright that its light has become dim, or where it has not thrown its beams of glory on still far distant objects. We are often in circumstances in which we feel that we have reached the outer limit of what man can teach us; but we never get into such circumstance in regard to the Word of God.<p>How precious is the book divine,<p>By, inspiration given!<p>Bright as a lamp its doctrines shine.<p>To guide our souls to heaven.<p>It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts.<p>In this dark vale of tears:<p>Life, light, and joy, it still imparts,<p>And quells our rising fears.<p>This lamp, through all the tedious night.<p>Of life, shall guide our way;<p>Till we behold the clearer light.<p>Of an eternal day. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. man of God&#8212;(See on [2505]1Ti 6:11).<p>perfect, throughly furnished&#8212;Greek, "thoroughly perfected," and so "perfect."

By the man of God may be meant everyone that in a special relation belongs to God; who is chosen by God the Father, redeemed by the Son, and called by the Spirit; but more especially a minister of the Gospel; for as it was usual to call a prophet under the Old Testament by this name, it seems to be transferred from thence to a minister of the New Testament, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a> and the design of the Scriptures and the end of writing them are, that both preachers of the word, and hearers of it, might have a perfect knowledge of the will of God; that the former might be a complete minister of the Gospel, and that nothing might be wanting for the information of the latter: <p>thoroughly furnished unto all good works, or "every good work"; particularly to the work of the ministry, which is a good one; and to every part and branch of it, a thorough furniture for which lies in the holy Scriptures; from whence, as scribes well instructed in the kingdom of heaven, do Gospel ministers bring forth things new and old, both for delight and profit: though this may be also applied to all good works in common, which the Scriptures point unto, give directions about, as well as show where strength is to be had to perform them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</span><p>(e) The Prophets and expounders of God's will are properly and distinctly called, men of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_timothy/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm" title="That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all good works.">2 Timothy 3:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἵνα</span> declares the purpose which Scripture is to serve.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄρτιος ᾖ ὁ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἄνθρωπος</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἄρτιος</span> (literally, “adapted”) is a <span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>., equivalent to <span class="greekheb">τέλειος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a>, “perfect;” according to Hofmann: “in suitable condition,” which, however, agrees with the notion of perfection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἄνθρωπος</span>] is mostly understood by expositors to denote those entrusted with the office of evangelist, and is referred specially to Timothy.
