The New Testament at this period was certainly not all written; for instance, St. John’s Gospel, St. John’s Epistles, the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the Apocalypse, with several of the Catholic Epistles, probably were composed at a later date than that assigned to this letter to Timothy. St. Paul, massing together an evidently well-known number of writings under the term <span class= "greekheb">πᾶσα γραϕή</span>, spoke of the Jewish Scriptures, the “canon” of which was then determined.<p>But such a declaration of the inspiration of these writings to Timothy and to those associated with him would seem unnecessary and uncalled for. Timothy and the trained Jew of the first century would never dream of doubting the divine origin of their most prized and sacred writings. There is nothing in the verses immediately preceding which would call out such a statement. It seems, therefore, on exegetical, as well as on grammatical, considerations best to follow the interpretation of those ancient and venerable witnesses the Syriac and Latin (Jerome’s) versions, and to understand St. Paul’s words here, as asserting that every inspired writing (this, it should be observed, does not exclude those recent sacred compositions which—Gospels or Epistles—he had seen or written himself, and the divine <span class= "ital">origin</span> of which he well knew) is profitable for doctrine, &c. Thus he exhorted Timothy to show himself a contrast to the false teachers—ever shifting their ground and waxing worse and worse—by keeping steadily to the old teaching of doctrine and of life. <span class= "ital">He</span> was not to change, not to advance, but was to remember that every inspired Scripture was profitable for doctrine and for life. It was by these writings, St. Paul would remind him, that he must test his teaching. On the way in which “inspiration of God” was understood in the Church of the first days, see <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> at the end of this Epistle.<p><span class= "bld">Inspiration of God.</span>—This thought, perhaps, rather than these words, is admirably paraphrased by St. Peter: “Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm" title="For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.">2Peter 1:21</a>). The various uses of Holy Scripture in the training of the man of God are set forth in the enumeration which closes this verse. These sacred writings must, in all ages, St. Paul would urge, be the hand-book of the Christian teacher. From it he must prove the doctrines he professes; hence, too, he must draw his reproofs for the ignorant and erring. It must be the one source whence he derives those instructions which teach the Christian how to grow in grace.<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS ON NOTES TO II.

In the hot and often angry controversies on this subject among us, it will be useful and interesting to see what were the opinions held by those learned and devoted men living, many of them, in the times immediately succeeding the first age of the Faith, when those walked on earth who had seen and conversed with the Lord Jesus.

In truth, divinely inspired <span class= "greekheb">πνευματικῶς</span><span class= "ital">, divinitus inspiratus</span>], he wrote to you Corinthians about himself, and Cephas, and Apollos, because just then factions [party spirit] existed among you.”<p>ASIA MINOR.—Polycarp of Smyrna, A.D. 108. <span class= "ital">Ep. to Philippians, </span>cap. iii.<p>Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, a disciple of St. John, in the one letter we possess of his, tells us “that neither he nor any like him is able to attain perfectly to the wisdom of the blessed and glorious Paul, who, when he was with you, before the men who were then living taught the word of truth perfectly and surely.”<p>SYRIA.—Ignatius of Antioch, A.D. 107. <span class= "ital">Ep. to Philad., </span>cap. v. <span class= "ital">Ep. to Magn., </span>cap. viii. <span class= "ital">Ep. to Romans, </span>cap. iv.<p>“Let us love the prophets” (of the Old Testament), wrote Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, the pupil of St. John, to the congregations of Philadelphia, “because they proclaimed the gospel, and believed in Christ, and waited for His coming, and through their faith in Him were saved.” “These most divine prophets lived according to Jesus Christ,” he writes to the Church of Magnesia, “being inspired by His grace.” Again: “I do not command you [Romans] like Peter and Paul: they were Apostles; I am a condemned man.”<p>EGYPT.—Barnabas of Alexandria, probably A.D. 140-160. <span class= "ital">Ep.

He wrote within half a century of St. John’s death. He in several places gives us his view of the inspiration of the divine writings. Referring to the Old Testament, he speaks of the history which Moses wrote by divine inspiration. while the Holy Spirit of Prophecy taught us through the instrumentality of Moses. Of David and of Isaiah he writes in similar terms (<span class= "ital">propheta Isaias divinitus afflatus a spiritu prophetico</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> His view, of the prophetic office is remarkable. “We must not suppose,” he writes, “that the expressions go forth from the men who are inspired, but from the divine word which moves them.” Speaking of the writers of the Old Testament, he calls them “holy men who required no eloquence, no skill in argumentative speaking, but who only needed to present themselves pure for the Divine Spirit to act upon, in order that the divine <span class= "ital">plectrum</span> [an instrument, usually of gold or ivory, used for striking the lyre], coming down from heaven, acting on just men as a plectrum on a lyre or harp, might reveal to us the knowledge of divine and heavenly things.”<p>ATHENS.—Athenagoras, A.D. 160-180. <span class= "ital">Leg. pro Christ.</span> 9.<p>This Athenian philosopher, who, while studying the Holy Scriptures with a view of refuting Christianity, was converted by the very writings he was endeavouring to bring into disrepute, writes (using the same strange, powerful metaphor which we found in the above quotation from Justin): “The prophets, while entranced . . . by the influence of the Divine Spirit, they gave utterance to what was wrought In them—the Spirit using them as instruments as a flute-player might blow a flute.”<p>LYONS.—Irenœus, A.D. 180. <span class= "ital">Contra Hœr, </span>iii. 1. <span class= "ital">Contra Hær</span>.iii. 5.<p>This famous writer and bishop of the early Church was connected in his early years with Polycarp, the pupil of St. John. He (to choose one out of many passages of his writings on this subject) thus writes of the Apostles:—“After that our Lord rose from the dead, and they [the Apostles] were clothed with the power of the Spirit from on high, they were filled with a perfect knowledge of all things.” “The Apostles, being the disciples of truth, are beyond all falsehood, though they speak according to the capacity of their hearers, talking blindly with the blind.”<p><span class= "ital">Contra Hœr.</span> ii. 28.<p>In another passage this Bishop of Lyons of the second century tells us, “The Scriptures are perfect, inasmuch as they were uttered by the Word of God and His Spirit.”<p>NORTH AFRICA: CARTHAGE.—Tertullian, A.D. 200. <span class= "ital">Apologia</span> xxxi.<p>Tertullian, perhaps the ablest—and, had it not been for his unhappy choice in later life of a wild and perverted form of Christianity, the greatest—of the Latin fathers, calls the Holy Scriptures the “voices of God” (<span class= "ital">voces Dei</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> In another place he writes that “the four Gospels are built on the certain basis of apostolical authority, and so are inspired in a far different sense from the writings of the spiritual Christian. All the faithful, it is true, have the Spirit of God; but all are not Apostles.”<p>EGYPT: ALEXANDRIA.—Clement master of the Catechetical School of Alexandria, A.D. 199-200. <span class= "ital">pæd. </span>i. 11. <span class= "ital">Protr.</span> i. 5<p>Clement of Alexandria was master of the catechetical school of the most learned city of the world at the end of the second century, only 100 years after the death of St. John; and taught in famous school—as did well-nigh all the early fathers of Christianity—the doctrine of the plenary inspiration of Scripture. “It was by the masters of Israel,” wrote Clement, “that God led men properly to the Messiah—speaking to them in the Law, the Psalms, and the Prophets . . . The word of God, disregarding the lifeless instruments, the lyre and the harp, reduces to harmony . . . man, and through that many-voiced instrument makes melody to God, and says to man, ‘Thou art my harp, my flute, my temple: my harp, from the harmony [of many notes]; my flute, from the Spirit that breatheth through thee; my temple, from the word that dwelleth in <span class= "ital">thee.’</span> Truly of man the Lord wrought a glorious living instrument, after the fashion of His own image—one which might give every harmony of God tuneful and holy.”<p><span class= "ital">De Antichriitn </span>2. ROME.—Hippolytus of Portus, A.D. 218. <span class= "ital">De antichristo, </span>2.<p>Hippolytus, Bishop of Portus (one of the suburban districts of Rome), a most learned and distinguished writer of the Italian Church of the early part of the third century, a pupil of Irenæus of Lyons, in one of his treatises preserved to us, expresses himself very clearly and with singular force on this subject. Speaking of the Jewish prophets, he writes, “These blessed men . . . spake not only of the past, but also of the present and future, that they might be shown to be heralds of things to come, not for a time merely, but for all generations. . . . For these fathers, having been perfected by the Spirit of Prophecy, and worthily honoured by the Word Himself, were brought to an inner harmony like instruments; and having the Word within them to strike the notes, by Him they were moved, and announced that which God wrote. For they did not speak of their own power, be well assured, nor proclaim that which they wished themselves, but first they were rightly endowed with wisdom by the Word, and afterwards well foretaught of the future by visions, and then, when thus assured, spake that which was revealed to them by God.”<p>ALEXANDRIA.—Origen, A.D. 230. <span class= "ital">De Principiis, </span>lib. i. <span class= "ital">Proœmium</span>, 4. <span class= "ital">De Principiis</span>, i. <span class= "ital">Proœmium</span>, i. <span class= "ital">Contr.Celsum</span>, vii. 4 <span class= "ital">Hom. in Jer.</span> xxi. 2.<p>The Church, while condemning the errors into which the greathearted Origen fell, still reads in every age with reverence and admiration his marvellous and brilliant teaching. It will be well to close this short paper on a great subject with two or three extracts from this famous Alexandrian master, on the subject of inspiration: “The Holy Spirit inspired each of the Saints, Prophets, and Apostles. . . . The same Spirit was present in those of old times as in those who were inspired at the coming of Christ.” “Christ, the Word of God, was in Moses and the prophet and by His Spirit they sake and did all things.” Again, in his work against Celsus, he writes the following wise and beautiful words:—“The true God acted on the prophets to enlighten and strengthen them, and not to cloud or to confuse their natural powers . . . . for the divine messengers, by the contact of the Holy Spirit with their soul, so to speak, gained a deeper and a clearer intuition of spiritual truth, and they then became more perfect men as well as wise seers.” In one of his homilies Origen does not hesitate even to say that “there is nothing, whether in the Law or in the Prophets, in the Evangelists or in the Apostles, which does not descend from the fulness of the divine majesty.”<p><span class= "ital">Hom. in Ex.</span> xi. <span class= "ital">Hom. in Gen.</span> xi. 3. <span class= "ital">De Principiis, </span>iv. 16 <span class= "ital">Home. in Jos.</span> xx.<p>This gifted teacher’s noble words on the way in which these God-inspired writings should be read deserve to be graven on the heart of every Christian believer: “We must read them with pure hearts, for no one can listen to the word of God . . . unless he be holy in body and spirit: . . . no one can enter into this feast with soiled garments. He who is a student of God’s oracles must place himself under the teaching of God; such a one must seek their meaning by inquiry, discussion, examination, and, which is greatest, by prayer. . . . Prayer is the most necessary qualification for the understanding of divine things. . . . If, then, we read the Bible with patience, prayer, and faith; if we ever strive after a more perfect knowledge, and yet remain content in some things to know only in part—even as prophets and apostles, saints and angels, attain not to an understanding of all things—our patience will be rewarded, our prayer answered, and our faith increased. So let us not be weary in reading the Scriptures which we do not understand, but let it be unto us according to our faith, by which we believe that <span class= "ital">all Scripture, being inspired by God, is profitable</span>” (Origen, quoted by Westcott).<p>[For many other early patristic references on this subject of the teaching of the Church of the first days on the subject of the “Inspiration of the Scriptures,” see the exhaustive paper of the Religious Professor of Divinity (Cambridge), Canon Westcott, in his <span class= "ital">Introduction to the Study of the Gospels</span>, Appendix C, pp. 383-423, upon which this short <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> is mainly based.]<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm" title="All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:">2 Timothy 3:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">All Scripture </span>— Or the whole Scripture, received by the Jewish Church, <span class="greekheb">θεοπνευστος</span>, <span class="ital">is inspired of God </span>— Respecting the inspiration of the books of the Old Testament, I find two opinions, says Dr. Benson, on this passage: “1st, That the writers of the several books had all the thoughts, and even the very words, suggested to them by the Spirit of God: and that they were the penmen of the Spirit to commit to writing just what he dictated. 2d, Others think with more latitude; and allow, indeed, that Moses received <span class="ital">the Law </span>from God; and that the prophets were inspired by the Spirit to foretel future events, which lay out of the reach of human foresight; but that they were left to express themselves in their own words and phrases, in which they give a faithful account of what the Spirit dictated to them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-20.htm" title="Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation....">2 Peter 1:20-21</a>. But as to what was handed down by authentic tradition, or the facts with which they themselves were thoroughly acquainted, they could, as faithful historians, commit them to writing, and that without any extraordinary inspiration. And their account, as far as our present copies are exact, may be depended upon as satisfactory and authentic.” He adds, “If the Spirit presided, strengthened their memories, and preserved them from mistakes, this last opinion may not be much amiss.” See <span class="ital">Introduction to the New Testament, </span>pp. 7, 8, where the subject of the divine inspiration of the Scriptures is more particularly considered. <span class="ital">Is profitable for doctrine </span>— All the great and important doctrines of religion necessary to be known in order to salvation, are there taught, and that more clearly and fully than elsewhere; and with an authority and influence to be found in no other writings. <span class="ital">For reproof </span>— Or <span class="ital">conviction, </span>as <span class="greekheb">ελεγχον </span>rather signifies; and that not only of error in judgment, but of sin in practice, and of condemnation and wrath due to us on account of sin; as also the depravity of our nature; of our weakness and inability to save ourselves, and of righteousness and salvation for us in Christ. <span class="ital">For correction </span>— Or <span class="ital">amendment, </span>as <span class="greekheb">επανορθωσιν </span>may be properly rendered; showing us clearly, 1st, What evils in temper, word, or work, are to be avoided: 2d, What graces and virtues must be possessed and practised; furnishing us, at the same time, with all proper and needful motives to holiness of heart and life, showing us where our strength lies. <span class="ital">For instruction </span>— Or training and building persons up, <span class="ital">in righteousness — </span>Leading them on from one degree of piety and virtue to another, with a progress which will continually advance in proportion to the regard they pay to these divine writings. For the Spirit of God not only once inspired those who endited them, but continually inspires and supernaturally assists those that read them in humility, simplicity, and faith, with earnest prayer to the Father of lights for a right understanding of them, and for inclination and power to reduce their contents to practice. <span class="ital">That the man of God </span>— Not only every Christian minister, or public teacher of religion, but every man devoted to the service of God; <span class="ital">may be perfect </span>— May come to <span class="ital">the measure of the stature of Christ’s fulness, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>, &c., where see the note, and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a>; or may stand complete in the whole will of God; <span class="ital">thoroughly furnished unto all good works </span>— Fitted for discharging every part of his duty. Thus we see that the apostle’s encomium on the Jewish Scriptures consists of two parts; their divine inspiration, and their usefulness for illustrating the gospel revelation; so that a Christian minister, who rightly understands them, is thereby fitted for every part of his work. Our Lord also, on various occasions, bare testimony to the Jewish Scriptures, and to their connection with the gospel. What then are we to think of those teachers who are at so much pains to disjoin the Christian revelation from the Jewish, as if the latter were not of divine original, and had no connection with the gospel; and, instead of illustrating and confirming the gospel, were rather an encumbrance to it? <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:14-17 Those who would learn the things of God, and be assured of them, must know the Holy Scriptures, for they are the Divine revelation. The age of children is the age to learn; and those who would get true learning, must get it out of the Scriptures. They must not lie by us neglected, seldom or never looked into. The Bible is a sure guide to eternal life. The prophets and apostles did not speak from themselves, but delivered what they received of God, 2Pe 1:21. It is profitable for all purposes of the Christian life. It is of use to all, for all need to be taught, corrected, and reproved. There is something in the Scriptures suitable for every case. Oh that we may love our Bibles more, and keep closer to them! then shall we find benefit, and at last gain the happiness therein promised by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the main subject of both Testaments. We best oppose error by promoting a solid knowledge of the word of truth; and the greatest kindness we can do to children, is to make them early to know the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All Scripture - This properly refers to the Old Testament, and should not be applied to any part of the New Testament, unless it can be shown that that part was then written, and was included under the general name of "the Scriptures;" compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15-16</a>. But it includes the whole of the Old Testament, and is the solemn testimony of Paul that it was all inspired. If now it can be proved that Paul himself was an inspired man, this settles the question as to the inspiration of the Old Testament.<p>Is given by inspiration of God - All this is expressed in the original by one word - &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Theopneustos. This word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It properly means, God-inspired - from &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  Theos, "God," and &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  pneo&#772;, "to breathe, to breathe out." The idea of "breathing upon, or breathing into the soul," is that which the word naturally conveys. Thus, God breathed into the nostrils of Adam the breath of life <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, and thus the Saviour breathed on his disciples, and said, "receive ye the Holy Ghost;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-22.htm">John 20:22</a>. The idea seems to have been, that the life was in the breath, and that an intelligent spirit was communicated with the breath. The expression was used among the Greeks, and a similar one was employed by the Romans. Plutarch ed. R. 9:p. 583. 9. &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  tous oneirous tous theopneustous.

So it is understood by Bloomfield. Cicero, pro Arch. 8. "poetam - quasi divino quodam spiritu inflari." The word does not occur in the Septuagint, but is found in Josephus, Contra Apion, i. 7. "The Scripture of the prophets who were taught according to the inspiration of God - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  kata te&#772;n epipnoian te&#772;n apo tou Theou. In regard to the manner of inspiration, and to the various questions which have been started as to its nature, nothing can be learned from the use of this word. It asserts a fact - that the Old Testament was composed under a divine influence, which might be represented by "breathing on one," and so imparting life. But the language must be figurative; for God does not breathe, though the fair inference is, that those Scriptures are as much the production of God, or are as much to be traced to him, as life is; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-43.htm">Matthew 22:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>. The question as to the degree of inspiration, and whether it extends to the words of Scripture, and how far the sacred writers were left to the exercise of their own faculties, is foreign to the design of these notes. All that is necessary to be held is, that the sacred writers were kept from error on those subjects which were matters of their own observation, or which pertained to memory; and that there were truths imparted to them directly by the Spirit of God, which they could never have arrived at by the unaided exercise of their own minds. Compare the introduction to Isaiah and Job.<p>And is profitable. - It is useful; it is adapted to give instruction, to administer reproof, etc. If "all" Scripture is thus valuable, then we are to esteem no part of the Old Testament as worthless. There is no portion of it, even now, which may not be fitted, in certain circumstances, to furnish us valuable lessons, and, consequently, no part of it which could be spared from the sacred canon. There is no part of the human body which is not useful in its place, and no part of it which can be spared without sensible loss.<p>For doctrine - For teaching or communicating instruction; compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a>.<p>For reproof - On the meaning of the word here rendered "reproof" - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  elengmos - see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>. It here means, probably, for "convincing;" that is, convincing a man of his sins, of the truth and claims of religion, etc.; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8</a>.<p>For correction - The word here used - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  epanortho&#772;sis - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, "a setting to rights, reparation, restoration," (from &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9;  epanorthoo&#772;, to right up again, to restore); and here means, the leading to a correction or amendment of life - "a reformation." The meaning is, that the Scriptures are a powerful means of reformation, or of putting men into the proper condition in regard to morals. After all the means which have been employed to reform mankind; all the appeals which are made to them on the score of health, happiness, respectability, property, and long life, the word of God is still the most powerful and the most effectual means of recovering those who have fallen into vice. No reformation can be permanent which is not based on the principles of the word of God.<p>For instruction in righteousness - Instruction in regard to the principles of justice, or what is right. Man needs not only to be made acquainted with truth, to be convinced of his error, and to be reformed; but he needs to be taught what is right, or what is required of him, in order that he may lead a holy life. Every reformed and regenerated man needs instruction, and should not be left merely with the evidence that he is "reformed, or converted." He should be followed with the principles of the word of God, to show him how he may lead an upright life. The Scriptures furnish the rules of holy living in abundance, and thus they are adapted to the whole work of recovering man, and of guiding him to heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. All scripture&#8212;Greek, "Every Scripture," that is, Scripture in its every part. However, English Version is sustained, though the Greek article be wanting, by the technical use of the term "Scripture" being so well known as not to need the article (compare Greek, Eph 3:15; 2:21). The Greek is never used of writings in general, but only of the sacred Scriptures. The position of the two Greek adjectives closely united by "and," forbids our taking the one as an epithet, the other as predicated and translated as Alford and Ellicott. "Every Scripture given by inspiration of God is also profitable." Vulgate and the best manuscripts, favor English Version. Clearly the adjectives are so closely connected that as surely as one is a predicate, the other must be so too. Alford admits his translation to be harsh, though legitimate. It is better with English Version to take it in a construction legitimate, and at the same time not harsh. The Greek, "God-inspired," is found nowhere else. Most of the New Testament books were written when Paul wrote this his latest Epistle: so he includes in the clause "All Scripture is God-inspired," not only the Old Testament, in which alone Timothy was taught when a child (2Ti 3:15), but the New Testament books according as they were recognized in the churches which had men gifted with "discerning of spirits," and so able to distinguish really inspired utterances, persons, and so their writings from spurious. Paul means, "All Scripture is God-inspired and therefore useful"; because we see no utility in any words or portion of it, it does not follow it is not God-inspired. It is useful, because God-inspired; not God-inspired, because useful. One reason for the article not being before the Greek, "Scripture," may be that, if it had, it might be supposed that it limited the sense to the hiera grammata, "Holy Scriptures" (2Ti 3:15) of the Old Testament, whereas here the assertion is more general: "all Scripture" (compare Greek, 2Pe 1:20). The translation, "all Scripture that is God-inspired is also useful," would imply that there is some Scripture which is not God-inspired. But this would exclude the appropriated sense of the word "Scripture"; and who would need to be told that "all divine Scripture is useful ('profitable')?" Heb 4:13 would, in Alford's view, have to be rendered, "All naked things are also open to the eyes of Him," &c.: so also 1Ti 4:4, which would be absurd [Tregelles, Remarks on the Prophetic Visions of the Book of Daniel]. Knapp well defines inspiration, "An extraordinary divine agency upon teachers while giving instruction, whether oral or written, by which they were taught how and what they should speak or write" (compare 2Sa 23:1; Ac 4:25; 2Pe 1:21). The inspiration gives the divine sanction to all the words of Scripture, though those words be the utterances of the individual writer, and only in special cases revealed directly by God (1Co 2:13). Inspiration is here predicated of the writings, "all Scripture," not of the persons. The question is not how God has done it; it is as to the word, not the men who wrote it. What we must believe is that He has done it, and that all the sacred writings are every where inspired, though not all alike matter of special revelation: and that even the very words are stamped with divine sanction, as Jesus used them (for example in the temptation and Joh 10:34, 35), for deciding all questions of doctrine and practice. There are degrees of revelation in Scripture, but not of inspiration. The sacred writers did not even always know the full significancy of their own God-inspired words (1Pe 1:10, 11, 12). Verbal inspiration does not mean mechanical dictation, but all "Scripture is (so) inspired by God," that everything in it, its narratives, prophecies, citations, the whole&#8212;ideas, phrases, and words&#8212;are such as He saw fit to be there. The present condition of the text is no ground for concluding against the original text being inspired, but is a reason why we should use all critical diligence to restore the original inspired text. Again, inspiration may be accompanied by revelation or not, but it is as much needed for writing known doctrines or facts authoritatively, as for communicating new truths [Tregelles]. The omission here of the substantive verb is,' I think, designed to mark that, not only the Scripture then existing, but what was still to be written till the canon should be completed, is included as God-inspired. The Old Testament law was the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ; so it is appropriately said to be "able to make wise unto salvation through faith in Jesus Christ": the term wisdom being appropriated to a knowledge of the relations between the Old and New Testaments, and opposed to the pretended wisdom of the false teachers (1Ti 1:7, 8).<p>doctrine&#8212;Greek, "teaching," that is, teaching the ignorant dogmatic truths which they cannot otherwise know. He so uses the Old Testament, Ro 1:17.<p>reproof&#8212;"refutation," convicting the erring of their error. Including polemical divinity. As an example of this use of the Old Testament, compare Ga 3:6, 13, 16. "Doctrine and reproof" comprehend the speculative parts of divinity. Next follow the practical: Scripture is profitable for: (1) correction (Greek, "setting one right"; compare an example, 1Co 10:1-10) and instruction (Greek, "disciplining," as a father does his child, see on [2504]2Ti 2:25; Eph 6:4; Heb 12:5, 11, or "training" by instruction, warning, example, kindnesses, promises, and chastisements; compare an example, 1Co 5:13). Thus the whole science of theology is complete in Scripture. Since Paul is speaking of Scripture in general and in the notion of it, the only general reason why, in order to perfecting the godly (2Ti 3:17), it should extend to every department of revealed truth, must be that it was intended to be the complete and sufficient rule in all things touching perfection. See Article VI, Common Prayer Book.<p>in&#8212;Greek, "instruction which is in righteousness," as contrasted with the "instruction" in worldly rudiments (Col 2:20, 22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All Scripture is given by inspiration of God:</span> Scripture signifies no more than writing; some therefore translate this text thus: All Scripture which is inspired of God; not all writings, but all the books of the Old Testament, is yeopneustov.

That is, all holy Scripture; for of that only the apostle is speaking; and he means the whole of it; not only the books of the Old Testament, but of the New, the greatest part of which was now written; for this second epistle to Timothy is by some thought to be the last of Paul's epistles; and this also will hold good of what was to be written; for all is inspired by God, or breathed by him: the Scriptures are the breath of God, the word of God and not men; they are "written by the Spirit", as the Syriac version renders it; or "by the Spirit of God", as the Ethiopic version. The Scriptures are here commended, from the divine authority of them; and which is attested and confirmed by various arguments; as the majesty and loftiness of their style, which in many places is inimitable by men; the sublimity of the matter contained in them, which transcends all human understanding and capacity ever to have attained unto and discovered; as the trinity of persons in the Godhead, the incarnation of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, &amp;c. The purity and holiness of them before observed, show them to be the word of him that is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity; as also their harmony and agreement, though wrote by different persons, in different places, and ages, and at sundry times, and in divers manners; what seeming inconsistencies are observed in them may, with labour and industry, by divine assistance, be reconciled. The predictions of future events in them, as particularly concerning Josiah and Cyrus, by name, long before they were born, and especially concerning Jesus Christ, and which have had their accomplishment, and many others in the New Testament both by Christ and his apostles, are a proof that they could not be the writings of men, but must have the omniscient God for their author; the impartiality of the writers of them, in not concealing the mean extract of some of them, the sins of others before conversion, and even their sins and failings afterwards, as well as those of their nearest relations and dearest friends, strengthens the proof of their divine authority; to which may be added, the wonderful preservation of them, through all the changes and declensions of the Jewish church and state, to whom the books of the Old Testament were committed; and notwithstanding the violence and malice of Heathen persecutors, particularly Dioclesian, who sought to destroy every copy of the Scriptures, and published an edict for that purpose, and notwithstanding the numbers of heretics, and who have been in power, as also the apostasy of the church of Rome; and yet these writings have been preserved, and kept pure and incorrupt, which is not the case of other writings; nor are there any of such antiquity as the oldest of these: to which may be subjoined the testimony of God himself; his outward testimony by miracles, wrought by Moses and the prophets, concerned in the writings of the Old Testament, and by the apostles in the New; and his internal testimony, which is the efficacy of these Scriptures on the hearts of men; the reading and hearing of which, having been owned for the conversion, comfort and edification of thousands and thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand: and <p>is profitable for doctrine; for the discovering, illustrating, and confirming any doctrine concerning God, the being, persons, and perfections of God; concerning the creation and fall of man; concerning the person and offices of Christ, redemption by him, justification by his righteousness, pardon by his blood, reconciliation and atonement by his sacrifice, and eternal life through him, with many others. The Scripture is profitable for ministers to fetch doctrine from, and establish it by; and for hearers to try and prove it by: <p>for reproof; of errors and heresies; this is the sword of the Spirit, which cuts all down. There never was, nor is, nor can be any error or heresy broached in the world, but there is a sufficient refutation of it in the Scriptures; which may be profitably used for that purpose, as it often has been by Christ and his apostles, and others since in all ages: <p>for correction; of vice; there being no sin, but the evil nature of it is shown, its wicked tendency is exposed, and the sad effects and consequences of it are pointed out in these writings: for instruction in righteousness; in every branch of duty incumbent upon men; whether with respect to God, or one another; for there is no duty men are obliged unto, but the nature, use, and excellency of it, are here shown: the Scriptures are a perfect rule of faith and practice; and thus they are commended from the usefulness and profitableness of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> All scripture <i>is</i> given by inspiration of God, and <i>is</i> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</span><p>(5) The eighth admonition which is most precious: a pastor must be wise by the word of God alone: in which we have perfectly delivered to us, whatever pertains to discerning, knowing and establishing true opinions, and to prove which opinions are false: and furthermore, to correct evil manners, and to establish good.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_timothy/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm" title="All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:">2 Timothy 3:16</a>.

Vulg.; so also in Clement, Origen, Tertullian, etc.) <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is wanting; and Luther did not express it in his translation; in that case <span class="greekheb">θεόπν</span>. is clearly an attribute belonging to the subject; Luther: “all Scripture inspired by God is.” With the correct reading, however, <span class="greekheb">θεόπν</span>. <span class="ital">may</span> be a predicate; so Bengel: est haec pars non subjecti (quam enim scripturam dicat Paulus, per se patet), sed praedicati; so, too, Matthies, de Wette, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, and others. Other expositors, again, such as Grotius, Rosenmüller, Heinrichs, Plitt, Hofmann, take <span class="greekheb">θεόπνευστος</span> as an attribute of the subject, even with this reading, and explain <span class="greekheb">καί</span> as “also.” This construction is the right one. On the one hand, it is ungrammatical to explain <span class="greekheb">πᾶσα γραφή</span> by “the whole of Scripture.” Wiesinger argues against this by appealing to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a> and to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-3.htm" title="For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house.">Hebrews 3:3</a>; see Meyer on the one passage and Delitzsch on the other, where, too, Lünemann translates: “every house.”[55] Wiesinger argues also that <span class="greekheb">γραφή</span> is regarded as a proper name, which he tries to prove by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-20.htm" title="Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.">2 Peter 1:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-15.htm" title="And the Jews marveled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?">John 7:15</a>; but, though a substantive is used once without an article, it does not follow that it has the signification of a proper name (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-15.htm" title="And the Jews marveled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?">John 7:15</a>, comp. Meyer). On the other hand, this sentence does not properly give a reason for the preceding thought (Wiesinger), but rather confirms it, and hence there was no reason for directing attention to the fact that the <span class="ital">whole</span> of Scripture is <span class="greekheb">θεόπνευστος</span>. There was no doubt on that point (viz. that the <span class="ital">whole</span> of Scripture and not a part of it was inspired by God), but on the point whether the Scriptures as <span class="greekheb">θεόπνευστοι</span> are <span class="ital">also</span> (<span class="greekheb">καί</span> serves to confirm) <span class="greekheb">ὠφέλιμοι</span>. There is no ground for asserting that, with this view, there could not have been an ellipse of <span class="greekheb">ἐστιν</span> (Wiesinger).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πρὸς διδασκαλίαν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Heydenreich thinks that the apostle is not speaking here of the profitableness of Scripture in general and for all Christians, but of its utility to teachers of religion. So also Hofmann: “The sentence does not say of what service Holy Scripture is to him who reads it, but what use can be made of it by him who teaches.” This view, however, is wrong; neither in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-14.htm" title="But continue you in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them;">2 Timothy 3:14</a> nor <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm" title="And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 3:15</a> is there anything said regarding Timothy’s work in teaching; the apostle does not pass on to this point till the next chapter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm" title="That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all good works.">2 Timothy 3:17</a> notwithstanding.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πρὸς διδασκ</span>.; Holy Scripture is profitable for teaching by advancing us in knowledge; <span class="greekheb">πρὸς ἔλεγχον</span> (or <span class="greekheb">ἐλεγμόν</span>), by convincing us of sin and rebuking us on account of sin. Theodoret: <span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχει γὰρ ἡμῶν τὸν παράνομον βίον</span>. Chrysostom understands it only of the conviction of error; so, too, Bengel: convincit etiam in errore et praejudicio versantes; Heydenreich, too, refers it, like <span class="greekheb">διδασκαλία</span>, only to what is theoretical. <span class="greekheb">Ἐλέγχειν</span> certainly does occur in this sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-9.htm" title="Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the disputers.">Titus 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-13.htm" title="This witness is true.

In the absence of any extant Greek MS. authority for the omission of <span class="greekheb">καί</span> before <span class="greekheb">ὠφέλιμος</span>, we may assume that the early writers who ignored it did so from carelessness.

Hence the rendering <span class="ital">writing</span> or <span class="ital">passage</span> is less free from ambiguity than <span class="ital">scripture</span> (R.V.). The nearest parallel to this <span class="ital">ascensive</span> use of <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, as Ellicott terms it, is <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-7.htm" title="Why you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.">Galatians 4:7</a>, <span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ νἱός</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ κληρονόμος</span>.

But as <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> is invariably used in the New Testament for "Scripture," and not for any profane writing: it is not in accordance with biblical language to say, "every inspired Scripture," because every <span class="accented">Scripture</span> is inspired. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The sentence, taken according to (B), is an extremely awkward, and, as Alford admits. harsh construction, net supported in its entirety by one single parallel usage in the whole New Testament. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The sentence, taken according to (A), is a perfectly simple one, and is exactly parallel with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is in perfect harmony with the context.

They are inspired of God, and hence their wide use and great power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> This interpretation is supported by high authority: Chrysostom, Gregory of Nyssa, etc., among the ancients (Alford); and Bengel, Wiesinger, De Wette, etc., among modern. The advocates of (B), as Bishop Ellicott, Dean Alford, etc., speak very doubtfully. With regard to the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, no doubt, strict grammar, in the absence of the article, favours the rendering in the R.V., "every Scripture," rather than that of the A.V., "all Scripture." But Alford's remark on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a> applies with full force here: "When a word or an expression came to bear a technical conventional meaning, it was also common to use it without the article, as if it were a proper name, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>," etc. Therefore, just as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-3.htm">Matthew 2:3</a>) means "all Jerusalem," not "every Jerusalem," so here <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> means "all  Scripture." What follows of the various uses of Holy Scripture is not true of "every Scripture." One Scripture is profitable for doctrine, another for reproof, and so on. Examples of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> without the article are <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-2.htm">Romans 1:2</a>; and of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> not followed by the article, and yet meaning "all," are in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a> and Ephesians 3:15. <span class="cmt_word">Inspired of God,</span> etc. (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament or LXX., but occasionally in classical Greek, as Plutarch. <span class="cmt_word">For teaching</span>, etc. The particular uses for which Scripture is said to be profitable present no difficulty.

Here in the same sense for the "conviction" or "refutation" of false teachers (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-9.htm">Titus 1:9, 13</a>), but probably including errors in living (compare in the 'Ordering of Priests,' "That there be no place left among you, either for error in religion or for viciousness in life"). <span class="cmt_word">Correction</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but occasionally in the LXX., and frequently in classical Greek, as Aristotle, Plato, etc., in the sense of "correction," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. setting a person or thing straight, "revisal," "improvement," "amendment," or the like.
