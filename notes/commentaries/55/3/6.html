As we shall see, these unhappy men busied themselves in securing popularity among the female portion of the flock in the Ephesian Church, and the way by which they won their popularity was by supplying anodynes for the guilty consciences of these women, laden, we are told, with sins The expression, “which creep into houses,” although perfectly natural, and one which, even in these Western countries, could be used with propriety to express the method in which these deceiving and perverting men make their way into households, yet, when we remember the comparative state of seclusion in which women usually lived and still live in Eastern lands, the words used by Paul acquire an increased force. Special fraud and deceit was needful for these false teachers to creep into the women’s apartments in Asia. The Greek word translated “lead captive” is a peculiar one, and is only found in comparatively later Greek. It is supposed to be a word of Alexandrian or Macedonian origin. It here represents these women as wholly under the influence of these bad men, to the utter destruction of all true, healthy, home life. The Greek word translated “silly women,” in the Vulgate “mulierculas,” is simply a diminutive, expressing contempt. There is no doubt but that the older Heresiarchs made great use of women in the propagation of their new and strange systems. They worked more easily, perhaps, on the impulsive and emotional female mind; but what has never sufficiently been taken into account is the reaction which was <span class= "ital">then</span> taking place among women, so long relegated to an inferior and subordinate position, and now, by the teaching of Christ and His Apostles, raised to a position of equality with men as regards the hope of future glory. In many instances, in the first ages of Christianity, there is no doubt, but that they misunderstood their position; they claimed work they could never do, and aimed after an influence they could never exercise, and thus, no doubt, in these first feverish years many a woman fell a comparatively easy prey to these proselytisers, who, laying claim to a higher and deeper wisdom, proposed now to lead some into the knowledge of profound and hidden mysteries, now offered ease of conscience to others if they would but follow them. Irenæus, in the second century, speaks of the special power which the Valentinian Gnostic Marcus had acquired over women; and Epiphanius, in the same century, also refers to the Gnostics’ deceitful influence with the female sex. Jerome, in an interesting though rhetorical passage (<span class= "ital">Epist. ad Ctesiphontem</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>cites a number of instances in which a woman shared in the baleful influence exercised by the leading masters of heresy in doctrine and laxity of life.<p>Simon Magus, he tells us, was accompanied by the wicked Helen. Nicolas, of Antioch, a teacher of immorality, gathered round him what Jerome calls <span class= "ital">choros fæmineos.</span> Montanus is associated with the well-known names of Maximilla and Prisca. Donatus is coupled with Lucilla. Marcion, Arius, Priscillian, and other Heresiarchs, famous in the annals of the early churches, he speaks of as intimately associated with or supported by female influence.<p><span class= "bld">Laden with sins, led away with divers lusts.</span>—This gives us some insight into the source of the power which these false teachers acquired over those women of Ephesus who <span class= "ital">in name</span> were Christians. They had accepted the faith of Christ, but were unable to live His life; over their passions and lusts had these no mastery. “Laden with sins,” and “led away with divers lusts,” these weak women fell an easy prey to men who procured them, by means of their lying doctrines, a false peace. By their words they seemed to have lulled the consciences of their female listeners to sleep. They showed them, no doubt, how in <span class= "ital">their</span> school they might still be Christians and yet indulge their divers lusts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/3-6.htm" title="For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,...">2 Timothy 3:6-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">For, </span>&c. — As if he had said, There is need to watch against such, because there are some of them already in the church; <span class="ital">for of this sort </span>are those artful deceivers who <span class="ital">creep into houses </span>— Insinuate themselves into families, and, having the appearance of godliness, <span class="ital">lead captive silly women </span>— Gain such influence over women of low rank and mean understandings as to obtain the direction of their consciences and purses; women who, whatever pretences they may make to sanctity, <span class="ital">are laden with sins, </span>and <span class="ital">led away with divers lusts </span>— Or desires, which these seducers know how to flatter, so as to make such persons their own property. “This, with the two subsequent verses, is thought by some a prophetical description of the practices of the Romish monks and friars in the dark ages, who, by hypocritical pretensions to extraordinary sanctity, and by auricular confession and other wicked arts, deluded and corrupted their female votaries. But practices similar to those began very early in the church, and, by a gradual progress, were at length, under the Romish hierarchy, formed into a regular system of deceit. We may therefore suppose, that as in the prophecies which foretel the political state of the world, so in those concerning the apostacy, in which its religious state is represented the general course of things through a succession of ages is foretold, rather than the state of things in any particular age. This will be allowed, when it is considered that not the rise only, but the progress and downfall of the apostacy is foretold in these prophecies. So that their subject being a series of things which were to happen throughout a long course of years, and which were gradually to produce a widely-extended and confirmed state of corruption in the church, there is no reason for limiting their fulfilment to any particular period.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Ever learning — </span>Pretending to hear with great eagerness, and, it may be, charmed with every appearance of fervour and novelty in their teachers, <span class="ital">but, </span>being tossed about with every wind of doctrine, they are <span class="ital">never able to come to the </span>experimental and practical <span class="ital">knowledge of the truth </span>— As it is in Jesus, or to attain any fixed and steady principles of religion.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 Even in gospel times there would be perilous times; on account of persecution from without, still more on account of corruptions within. Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and do their duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious to keep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men do not fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedient to their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy and without the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. We abuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts. Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection to children. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despise that which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all; but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing before him, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very different from the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, real Christians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within the outward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have been artful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour and confidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful. All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every new notion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptian magicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against the truth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For of this sort are they which creep into houses - Who go slyly and insidiously into families. They are not open and manly in endeavoring to propagate their views, but they endeavor by their address to ingratiate themselves first with weak women, and through them to influence men; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-11.htm">Titus 1:11</a>. The word translated "creep into," is rendered by Doddridge, "insinuate themselves;" by Bloomfield, "wind their way into," in the manner of serpents; by Bretschneider, "deceitfully enter;" by Robinson and Passow," go in, enter in." It is not certain that the idea of deceit or cunning is contained in this "word," yet the whole complexion of the passage implies that they made their way by art and deceitful tricks.<p>And lead captive silly women - One of the tricks always played by the advocates of error, and one of the ways by which they seek to promote their purposes. Satan began his work of temptation with Eve rather than with Adam, and the advocates of error usually follow his example. There are always weak-minded women enough in any community to give an opportunity of practicing these arts, and often the aims of the impostor and deceiver can be best secured by appealing to them. Such women are easily flattered; they are charmed by the graceful manners of religious instructors; they lend a willing ear to anything that has the appearance of religion, and their hearts are open to anything that promises to advance the welfare of the world. At the same time, they are just such persons as the propagators of error can rely upon. They have leisure; they have wealth; they are busy; they move about in society, and by their activity they obtain an influence to which they are by no means entitled by their piety or talents. There are, indeed, very many women in the world who cannot be so easily led away as men; but it cannot be denied also that there are those who are just adapted to the purposes of such as seek to spread plausible error. The word rendered "silly women," means properly "little women," and then "weak women."<p>Laden with sins - With so many sins that they seem to be "burdened" with them. The idea is, that they are under the influence of sinful desires and propensities, and hence, are better adapted to the purposes of deceivers.<p>Led away with divers lusts - With various kinds of passions or desires - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  epithumias - such as pride, vanity, the love of novelty, or a susceptibility to flattery, so as to make them an easy prey to deceivers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. of this sort&#8212;Greek, "of these," such as were described (2Ti 3:5).<p>creep into&#8212;stealthily.<p>laden with sins&#8212;(Isa 1:4); applying to the "silly women" whose consciences are burdened with sins, and so are a ready prey to the false teachers who promise ease of conscience if they will follow them.

Privily and unawares, in a clandestine manner, and insinuate themselves into families, by fawning and flattering, and under specious pretences to knowledge and virtue. The Syriac version uses a word, from whence comes  "Chulda", which signifies "a weasel"; suggesting, that their entrance into houses was like to the way of that creature, which is sometimes covered, and sometimes open: there was also a gate of the temple, which was called "Huldah"; whether there is any allusion in the word to that, may be inquired (k). <p>And lead captive silly women; the coming of antichrist is after the working of Satan; as Satan attacked the woman, and not the man, and beguiled Eve and not Adam, so these his instruments and emissaries, work themselves into the affections of the weaker vessel, and into the weaker sort of women, as the diminutive word here used signifies; and gain upon them, instil their principles into them, attach them to their interests, captivate them to them, and lead them as they please: <p>laden with sins; covered with them, full of them, and so ready to receive any set of principles that would encourage them to continue in them; or else were pressed down with a sense of them, their consciences being awakened, and they under some concern on account of them, and so fit persons for such deceivers to gain upon, by pretending to great sanctity and religion, and by providing them with pardons and indulgences, and putting them upon penance, &amp;c. though the former sense seems most agreeable, and is confirmed by what follows, <p>led away with divers lusts. The Alexandrian copy adds, "and pleasures"; that is, sinful ones; though this may be understood, not of unclean lusts, but of the itch and desire after new teachers, and new doctrines, and practices, which prevail in weak women, and by which they are governed and led away. <p>(k) Vid.

In this verse the apostle passes on to definite facts in the present.

Hofmann says that “Paul was thinking of people who wished to be considered, and pretended to be, on good terms with Timothy;” but there is no hint of this in the context. By similarity of disposition they belong already to the number of the godless men of the future; hence Paul says: <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τούτων γάρ εἰσιν</span>] <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> gives the reason of the previous exhortation, as the apostle means to declare that men such as he has described already exist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐνδύνοντες εἰς τὰς οἰκίας</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐνδύνειν</span> here, “<span class="ital">enter, press into</span>,” with a suggestion of secrecy; Luther: “who slip into houses here and there;” Bengel: irrepentes clanculum; in this sense the word is <span class="greekheb">ἅπαξ λεγ</span>.[46] The form of expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ἘΝΔΎΝΟΝΤΕς</span></span></span> shows that this <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝΔΎΝΕΙΝ</span></span></span> is a characteristic of those of whom the apostle is speaking.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The purpose of this secret entering is given in the next words: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΑἸΧΜΑΛΩΤΊΖΟΝΤΕς ΓΥΝΑΙΚΆΡΙΑ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.] <span class="greekheb">ΑἸΧΜΑΛΩΤΊΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, a verb belonging to later Greek: “make a prisoner of war;” it denotes here, getting complete possession of; the word is thoroughly apposite for describing the conduct of the founders of heretical sects.[47]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γυναικάρια</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>., the diminutive with a suggestion of contempt; “the contemptuous epithet indicates their weakness and proneness to temptation” (van Oosterzee).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The nature of these <span class="greekheb">γυναικάρια</span> is described in the following three participial clauses: <span class="greekheb">σεσωρευμένα ἁμαρτίαις</span>] <span class="greekheb">σωρεύειν</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-20.htm" title="Therefore if your enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head.">Romans 12:20</a>), “gather, heap up,” corresponds to the Latin cumulare: “cumulatae peccatis.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀγόμενα ἐπιθυμίαις ποικίλαις</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-14.htm" title="For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.">Romans 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-18.htm" title="But if you be led of the Spirit, you are not under the law.">Galatians 5:18</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἄγεσθαι πνεύματι</span>). Luther is inaccurate: “who go on with manifold lusts.” Their internal motive and spring of action are their manifold lusts; Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">τί ἐστι ποικίλαις</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἐνταῦθα πολλὰ ἠνίξατο</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν τρυφὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀσχημοσύνην</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν λαγνείαν</span>.

Hence it goes on: <span class="greekheb">καὶ μηδέποτε εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν ἀληθείας ἐλθεῖν δυνάμενα</span>] <span class="greekheb">μηδέποτε</span> is <span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>.; <span class="greekheb">δυνάμενα</span> is emphatic; they <span class="ital">cannot</span> attain to the truth, because the necessary conditions do not exist in their inner life.
