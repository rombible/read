St. Paul now (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2Timothy 3:1</a>), having told him that although there was no reason to fear, yet warns him that grave dangers to the Church <span class= "ital">would</span> surely arise, and that God’s servants, like Timothy, must be prepared to combat.<p><span class= "bld">In the last days.</span>—The majority of commentators have referred “the last days” here spoken of to the period immediately preceding the second coming of the Lord—a day and an hour somewhere in the future but hidden, not merely from all men, but from the angels, and even from the Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.">Mark 13:32</a>).<p>It seems, however, more in accordance with such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1John 2:18</a> : “Little children, it is the last time”—where <span class= "ital">the present, </span>and not an uncertain future is alluded to—to understand “the last days “as that period, probably of very long duration, extending from the days of the first coming of Messiah—in which time St. Paul lived—to the second coming of Christ in judgment. The Jewish Rabbis of the days of St. Paul were in the habit of speaking of two great periods of the world’s history—“this age,” and “the age to come.” The former of these, “this age,” including all periods up to Messiah’s advent; the latter, “the age to come,” including all periods subsequent to the appearance of Messiah. We find the same idea embodied later in the Talmud (treatise “Sanhedrim”) 6,000 years are mentioned as the duration of the world, 2,000 years, waste or chaos, 2,000 years under the law, 2,000 years the days of Messiah.” This last period, “the days of Messiah,” are often alluded to by the Hebrew prophets under the expression, “in the last days”—literally, <span class= "ital">in the end of days.</span> (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow to it.">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm" title="Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.">Hosea 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm" title="But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow to it.">Micah 4:1</a>.) The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm" title="Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.">2Timothy 3:5</a>, “from such turn away,” would require certainly a strained interpretation if we are to suppose that the “last days” referred to a time immediately preceding the end, or, in other words, the last period of the Christian era. The sad catalogue of vices is, alas, one with which all ages of the Church of Christ has been too well acquainted. The Christian teacher has no need to look forward to a future time of deeper iniquity, when in the Church of the living God will be found those who will deserve the dreary titles of this passage. The Church of his own age will supply him with examples of many such, for “In a great house . . . are there not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood, and earth, and some to honour and some to dishonour.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come....">2 Timothy 3:1-2</a></span>. The apostle, at the close of the preceding chapter, having intimated to Timothy that false teachers did and would arise in the church, he, in the beginning of this chapter, foretels that in future times, through the pernicious influence of corrupt doctrines propagated by these teachers, many professing Christians, and, among the rest, the false teachers themselves, would become so wicked, that it would become dangerous to the truly pious to live among them. As if he had said, It is the more necessary to urge thee, as I do, to use every precaution and every effort which may tend to preserve the purity and honour of the Christian Church, since, after all we can do for this purpose, sad scenes will open in it. <span class="ital">This know also </span>— Besides what I formerly told thee concerning the apostacy, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>,) <span class="ital">that in the last, </span>or <span class="ital">latter days </span>— That is, under the gospel dispensation, called the latter days, as being intended to wind up the economy of providence, and to remain in full force even to the end of the world: <span class="ital">perilous times shall come </span>— In which it will be difficult for the faithful followers of Jesus to discharge their consciences, and yet, at the same time, to maintain their safety. <span class="ital">For men </span>— Even within the pale of the outward church, <span class="ital">will be </span>— In great numbers, and to a higher degree than ever, <span class="ital">lovers of themselves </span>— Only, (the first root of evil,) not of God and their neighbours. “The vices mentioned in this and the two following verses have always existed in the world. But their being spoken of here as characteristic of the latter days, implies that, besides being common in these days, they would be openly avowed and defended. Accordingly, it is well known, the clergy of the Romish Church have defended all the enormities mentioned by the apostle, encouraged the people by their false doctrine to commit them, and gone before them in the practice of them.” <span class="ital">Covetous </span>— <span class="greekheb">Φιλαργυροι</span>, <span class="ital">lovers of money, </span>(the second root of evil,) so as to be impelled to the basest practices, by the hopes of obtaining it. The Catholic clergy, it is well known, have carried their love of money to such a height, that they pretend to sell heaven for money, even to the wickedest of men, under the name of indulgences; <span class="ital">boasters </span>— Of what they have, or are, or can do; <span class="ital">proud </span>— Thinking highly of themselves on these accounts; <span class="ital">blasphemers </span>— Of God, and revilers of their fellow-creatures; <span class="ital">disobedient to parents </span>— Notwithstanding all the obligations they are under to them. “In the language of the Hebrews, parents signified superiors of every denomination. The disobedience of the Romish clergy to princes and magistrates, and even their dethroning princes, is well known. It may also signify their encouraging children to become monks and nuns, contrary to the will of their parents.” <span class="ital">Unthankful </span>— To other benefactors, and to God for the blessings of providence and grace; <span class="ital">unholy </span>— Though they profess themselves to be devoted to God, and consecrated to his service by the most solemn rites.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-9 Even in gospel times there would be perilous times; on account of persecution from without, still more on account of corruptions within. Men love to gratify their own lusts, more than to please God and do their duty. When every man is eager for what he can get, and anxious to keep what he has, this makes men dangerous to one another. When men do not fear God, they will not regard man. When children are disobedient to their parents, that makes the times perilous. Men are unholy and without the fear of God, because unthankful for the mercies of God. We abuse God's gifts, if we make them the food and fuel of our lusts. Times are perilous also, when parents are without natural affection to children. And when men have no rule over their own spirits, but despise that which is good and to be honoured. God is to be loved above all; but a carnal mind, full of enmity against him, prefers any thing before him, especially carnal pleasure. A form of godliness is very different from the power; from such as are found to be hypocrites, real Christians must withdraw. Such persons have been found within the outward church, in every place, and at all times. There ever have been artful men, who, by pretences and flatteries, creep into the favour and confidence of those who are too easy of belief, ignorant, and fanciful. All must be ever learning to know the Lord; but these follow every new notion, yet never seek the truth as it is in Jesus. Like the Egyptian magicians, these were men of corrupt minds, prejudiced against the truth, and found to be quite without faith. Yet though the spirit of error may be let loose for a time, Satan can deceive the nations and the churches no further, and no longer, than God will permit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This know also - The "object" of this reference to the perilous times which were to occur, was evidently to show the necessity of using every precaution to preserve the purity of the church, from the fact that such sad scenes were to open upon it. The apostle had dwelt upon this subject in his First Epistle to Timothy <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4.htm">2 Timothy 4</a>, but its importance leads him to advert to it again.<p>In the last days - Under the gospel dispensation; some time in that period during which the affairs of the world will be closed up; see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a> note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a> note.<p>Perilous times shall come - Times of danger, of persecution, and of trial.

That not only men of bad principles and practices are in the churches now, as before described in the preceding chapter, but that in succeeding ages there would be worse men, if possible, and the times would be still worse; this the apostle had, and delivered by a spirit of prophecy, and informed Timothy, and others of it, that he and they might be prepared for such events, and fortified against them: <p>that in the last days perilous times shall come; "or hard" and difficult times to live in; not by reason of the outward calamities, as badness of trade, scarcity of provisions, the ravages of the sword, &amp;c. but by reason of the wickedness of men, and that not of the profane world, but of professors of religion; for they are the persons afterwards described, who will make the times they live in difficult to others, to live soberly, righteously, and godly; the days will be evil, because of these evil men: or they will be "troublesome" times, very afflicting and distressing to pious minds; as the places and times, and men and customs of them were to Lot, David, Isaiah, and others: and also "dangerous" ones to the souls of men; who will be beguiled by their fair speeches, and specious pretences, to follow their pernicious ways, which will bring destruction upon them; their doctrines will eat as a gangrene, and their evil communications will corrupt good manners, before observed. And these times will be "in the last days" of the apostolic age, and onward to the end of the world: the Jews generally understand by this phrase, when used in the Old Testament, the days of the Messiah; and which are the last days of the world, in comparison of the times before the law, from Adam to Moses, and under the law, from thence to Christ; and even in the times of the apostles, at least towards the close of them, great numbers of men rose up under the Christian name, to whom the following characters well agree, as the Gnostics, and others; and who paved the way for the man of sin, the Romish antichrist, whose priests and votaries are here likewise described to the life: so that these last days may take in the general defection and apostasy of the church of Rome, as well as those times, which followed the apostles, and those which will usher in the second coming of Christ.

"Grievous" is not a very good rendering. "Perilous," though in some contexts it is a right rendering, is a little too restricted here. "Difficult," "trying," "uneasy," or the like, is nearer the sense. They are times when a Christian hardly knows which way to turn or what to do.
