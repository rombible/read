It has been suggested that Lois, Eunice, and Timothy were kinsfolk of St. Paul, hence his intimacy with the family, and his knowledge of their faith; hence, too, perhaps, his devoted and unbroken friendship for Timothy. We are told (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a>) that this Eunice was a Jewess, married to a Greek. Lystra is no great distance from Tarsus—whence St. Paul came. The supposition is just possible; but it is only an ingenious thought, there being no data to support it. Of the names—Lois is the same with the more familiar Lais; Eunice is an equivalent of the Latin Victoria.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 The promise of eternal life to believers in Christ Jesus, is the leading subject of ministers who are employed according to the will of God. The blessings here named, are the best we can ask for our beloved friends, that they may have peace with God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. Whatever good we do, God must have the glory. True believers have in every age the same religion as to substance. Their faith is unfeigned; it will stand the trial, and it dwells in them as a living principle. Thus pious women may take encouragement from the success of Lois and Eunice with Timothy, who proved so excellent and useful a minister. Some of the most worthy and valuable ministers the church of Christ has been favoured with, have had to bless God for early religious impressions made upon their minds by the teaching of their mothers or other female relatives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee; - notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a>. On the faith of Timothy, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-6.htm">1 Timothy 4:6</a>.<p>Which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois - That is, the same faith dwelt in her; or, she was a sincere believer in Christ. It would seem probable, from this, that she was the first of the family who had been converted. In the Acts of the Apostles Act 16:1, we have an account of the family of Timothy: - "Then came he to Derbe and Lystra; and behold a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek." In this account no mention is made of the grandmother Lois, but there is no improbability in supposing that Paul was better acquainted with the family than Luke. There is, at any rate, no contradiction between the two accounts; but the one confirms the other, and the "undesigned coincidence" furnishes an argument for the authenticity of both. See Paley's Horae Paulinae, in loc. As the mother of Timothy was a Hebrew, it is clear that his grandmother was also. Nothing more is known of her than is mentioned here.<p>And in thy mother Eunice - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a>, it is said that the mother of Timothy was "a Jewess, and believed;" but her name is not mentioned. This shows that Paul was acquainted with the family, and that the statement in the Epistle to Timothy was not forged from the account in the Acts . Here is another "undesigned coincidence." In the history in the Acts , nothing is said of the father, except that he was "a Greek," but it is implied that he was not a believer. In the Epistle before us, nothing whatever is said of him. But the piety of his mother alone is commended, and it is fairly implied that his father was not a believer. This is one of those coincidences on which Paley has constructed his beautiful argument in the Horae Paulinae in favor of the genuineness of the New Testament. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. When I call to remembrance&#8212;This increased his "desire to see" Timothy. The oldest manuscripts read, "When I called to remembrance"; implying that some recent incident (perhaps the contrasted cowardice of the hypocrite Demas, who forsook him) had reminded him of the sincerity of Timothy's faith.<p>faith that is in thee&#8212;Alford translates, "that was in thee." He remembers Timothy's faith in the past as a fact; its present existence in him is only matter of his confident persuasion or hope.<p>which&#8212;Greek, "such as."<p>dwelt&#8212;"made its dwelling" or abode (Joh 14:23).

She was the furthest back of the progenitors of Timothy whom Paul knew.<p>mother Eunice&#8212;a believing Jewess; but his father was a Greek, that is, a heathen (Ac 16:1). The faith of the one parent sanctified the child (2Ti 3:15; 1Co 7:14). She was probably converted at Paul's first visit to Lystra (Ac 14:6). It is an undesigned coincidence, and so a mark of truth, that in Ac 16:1 the belief of the mother alone is mentioned, just as here praise is bestowed on the faith of the mother, while no notice is taken of the father [Paley, Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;].<p>and&#8212;Greek, "but," that is, notwithstanding appearances [Alford].<p>persuaded that&#8212;it dwells, or it shall dwell "in thee also." The mention of the faith of his mother and grandmother is designed as an incentive to stir up his faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle expresseth another cause of his affection to Timothy, viz. his sincere owning and adhering to the profession of the gospel; as his <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">grandmother Lois</span> and his <span class="bld">mother Eunice</span> had done before him (he saith nothing of his father, for he was a Jew proselyted, or a heathen, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a></span>); and though he could not infallibly determine, yet he was verily persuaded of his sincerity also. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_timothy/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee,.... This caused him to give thanks to God for it, whose gift it is and made him the more desirous of seeing one, who was a true believer, and an Israelite indeed. This is to be understood of the grace of faith, which was implanted in the heart of Timothy by the Spirit of God, and was genuine and sincere; he believed with the heart unto righteousness; his faith worked by love to God, and Christ, and to his people, and was attended with good works; <p>which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois: who was his grandmother, not by his father's side, who was a Greek, but by his mother's side; and so the Syriac version renders it, "thy mother's mother"; who, though she might not know that the Messiah was come in the flesh, and that Jesus of Nazareth was he, yet believed in the Messiah to come, and died in the faith of it, and in a dependence upon righteousness and salvation by him; and so her faith was of the same kind with Timothy's; and which dwelt in her, and continued with her to the last: <p>and thy mother Eunice: who was a Jewess, and a believer in Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a> though her name is a Greek one, and so is her mother's name; hers signifies "good victory", and is the name of one of the Nereides, the daughters of Oceanus (a); and her mother's signifies "better", or "more excellent". She lived, it seems, if her mother did not, to know that Christ was come, and that Jesus, the son of Mary, was he; and she believed in him for righteousness, life, and salvation; and in her this faith dwelt and abode to the end. <p>And I am persuaded that in thee also; not only that faith was in him, and that that was unfeigned, but that it also dwelt, remained, and would continue with him to the end of life; for true faith is an abiding grace, it is a gift of God, that is irrevocable, and without repentance; Christ is the author and finisher of it, and prays that it fail not, whose prayers are always heard; it is begun, carried on, and performed by the power of God, and has salvation inseparably connected with it. Now when the same faith is said to dwell, first in his grandmother, and in his mother, and in him, this is not to be understood as if this grace was conveyed from one to another by natural generation; for grace comes not that way, only sin; men are not born of blood, but of God; but the sense is, that the same like precious faith was obtained by one, as by another. This was a rich family mercy, and deserved special notice, as being a thing uncommon, and required a particular thanksgiving; and is designed as a motive and encouragement to stir up Timothy to the exercise of that grace, and every other gift God had bestowed upon him, as in the following verse. <p>(a) Hesiod.

Otto joins it with <span class="greekheb">ἵνα χαρᾶς πληρωθῶ</span>: “that I may be filled with joy, as I (<span class="ital">sc.</span> by thy personal presence in Rome) receive a renewal of my remembrance of thy unfeigned faith.” Against this construction, however, there are the following reasons:—(1) That to supply “by thy presence” is not only arbitrary, but does not suit with the idea <span class="greekheb">ὑπόμνησιν λαμβάνειν</span>, since the impression made on us by anything before the eyes cannot be described as reminding us of that thing. (2) That, if the remembrance of Timothy’s constancy in the faith is so unceasing with the apostle that he thanks God for it, it is quite inconceivable how he could still wish to receive a <span class="greekheb">ὑπόμνησις</span> of it. (3) That we see ourselves forced by it to prefer the reading <span class="greekheb">λαμβάνων</span> (which Tisch. adopted) to <span class="greekheb">λαβών</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The only remaining course is to connect <span class="greekheb">ὑπομν</span>. <span class="greekheb">λαβ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">χάριν ἔχω τῷ Θεῷ</span> (so Wiesinger, Plitt, and others). It does stand at some distance from it, but that cannot be considered a good reason against the construction. The construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,...">Php 1:3-5</a> is similar. Nor can we make objection that “Paul according to this view would not thank God because Timothy stands in such faith, but because he has been brought to his recollection” (Hofmann), for the participial clause does not give the reason of the thanksgiving directly, but only hints at it. It is the same here as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,">Ephesians 1:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm" title=" We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,">Colossians 1:3</a>, where, too, the subject of thanksgiving is not the <span class="greekheb">ἀκούειν</span>, but that which the apostle had heard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑπόμνησιν λαβών</span> is not equivalent to “recordans, as I remember” (de Wette: “retaining the remembrance”), for <span class="greekheb">ὑπόμνησις</span> in the N. T. (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-13.htm" title="Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;">2 Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-1.htm" title="This second letter, beloved, I now write to you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:">2 Peter 3:1</a>; also <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/16-11.htm" title="And if there be one stiffnecked among the people, it is marvel if he escape unpunished: for mercy and wrath are with him; he is mighty to forgive, and to pour out displeasure.">Sir 16:11</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/6-17.htm" title="But let this that we at spoken be for a warning unto us.

It is not said what had reminded the apostle of Timothy’s faith. Bengel supposes that it was <span class="ital">externa quaedam occasio</span>, or a <span class="ital">nuntius a Timotheo</span>; Wiesinger, that it was Onesimus. But it suits better with the context to regard the tears just mentioned as causing the recollection, inasmuch as they were to the apostle a proof of his unfeigned faith. It is unnecessary to derive the <span class="greekheb">ὑπόμνησις</span> from some inner working of the apostle’s soul (so formerly in this commentary); there is no hint of any such thing. The present <span class="greekheb">λαμβάνων</span> is not against this interpretation, since these tears came so vividly before the apostle’s soul that he was thereby reminded more and more of Timothy’s faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐν σοὶ ἀνυποκρίτου πίστεως</span>] see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1 Timothy 1:5</a>; this, now, is the subject of the thanksgiving.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As Paul is conscious that the God whom he serves was the God also of his ancestors, he can remind Timothy of the fact that the faith which dwells in him was before the possession of his grandmother and mother.[5]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἐνῴκησε πρῶτον</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐνοικεῖν</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-14.htm" title="That good thing which was committed to you keep by the Holy Ghost which dwells in us.">2 Timothy 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-16.htm" title="And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>. The word is chosen here “to denote faith on its objective side as a possession coming from God” (Wiesinger), and it declares that “it has not become a merely transient feeling, but an abiding principle of life dwelling in them” (van Oosterzee).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῶΤΟΝ</span></span></span> is not, with Luther, to be translated by “before,” but to be taken in its proper meaning, in reference to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΌΓΟΝΟΙ</span></span></span> of Timothy. The point brought out is, that Timothy was not the first of his family to be a believer, but we cannot press the point so far as to suppose that a distinction is drawn between the apostle whose ancestors served God as Jews, while Timothy’s ancestors were heathen (so Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῇ ΜΆΜΜῌ ΣΟΝ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>] Regarding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΆΜΜΗ</span></span></span>, see Wahl on the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This grandmother of Timothy is not mentioned elsewhere. Of the mother, it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a> ff. that she was a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΥΝΉ ἸΟΥΔΑΊΑ ΠΙΣΤΉ</span></span></span>; her name is given only here. The mention of the two is not to be regarded as a superfluous—or even surprising—afterthought. Paul might repose in Timothy all the greater confidence, that he, brought up by a pious mother, had before him her example and that of his grandmother.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This confidence the apostle expresses still more definitely in the next words: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΈΠΕΙΣΜΑΙ ΔῈ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὍΤΙ ΚΑῚ ἘΝ ΣΟΊ</span></span></span>, with which Heydenreich wrongly supplies <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝΟΙΚΉΣΕΙ</span></span></span> instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝΟΙΚΕῖ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[5] Since Timothy’s <span class="greekheb">ἀνυπόκριτος πίστις</span> is Christian faith, faith in Jesus Christ, it is manifestly wrong to regard the <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> of the grandmother and mother as only faith in the O. T. promise (Otto); the relative <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> shows that the two are identical. From Paul’s ascription to himself of a <span class="greekheb">λατρεύειν ἀπὸ προγόνων</span>, we cannot infer, with Otto, that the “matter of faith on the part of Timothy’s <span class="greekheb">πρόγονοι</span> cannot be taken <span class="ital">further</span> than on the part of the apostle’s <span class="greekheb">πρόγονοι</span>.” The apostle does not at all boast of the <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span> of his ancestors, but says merely that he serves <span class="ital">the same</span> God as they had served. Timothy’s faith could only mean something to him, if it was not only faith in the promise, but also faith in Him who had appeared according to the promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-5.htm" title="When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you also.">2 Timothy 1:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπόμνησιν λαβών</span>: <span class="ital">Having been reminded</span>.

The writer's thought is probably not confined to Christian faith, but has in view the continuity of Judaism and Christianity. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a> he speaks of serving God from his forefathers. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a> Paul is represented as saying that even as a Christian he serves the God of his fathers, believing all things contained in the law and the prophets.<p>Dwelt (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Paul uses the verb with sin, the divine Spirit, God, the word of Christ, but nowhere with faith. The phrase faith dwells in, N.T.o. According to Paul, Christians are or stand in faith; but faith is not represented as dwelling in them. Christ dwells in the heart through faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>).<p>First (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>With reference to Timothy, and with a comparative sense, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-24.htm">Matthew 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-5.htm">Matthew 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-27.htm">Mark 3:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>, etc. This is shown by the last clause of the verse. The writer merely means that faith had already dwelt in Timothy's grandmother and mother before it did in him. How much farther back his believing ancestry went he does not say.

From the emphasis upon Timothy's receiving his training from his Jewish mother, it has been inferred that his father died early.
