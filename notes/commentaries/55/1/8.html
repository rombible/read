This “testimony” of which Timothy was not to be ashamed, of course includes the sufferings and the shame of Christ. In these, before mocking, scornful men, must Timothy, as an example to the flock, rather glory; but “the testimony” signifies much more than what relates only to the Passion story. The Christian, instead of being ashamed of his “profession,” must before the world show fearlessly that its hopes and its promises are his most precious treasure.<p><span class= "bld">Nor of me his prisoner.</span>—Nor must Timothy either then, or in days to come, be afraid of confessing before men that he had been the disciple and friend of the prisoner St. Paul, who had paid so dearly for the courage of his opinions. Nor Timothy, nor any Christian must shrink from openly espousing the unpopular cause of the Crucified, or from publicly declaring their sympathy with its hated martyrs.<p><span class= "bld">But be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel.</span>—More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">but rather</span> <span class= "ital">suffer afflictions for the gospel.</span> But, on the contrary, instead of injuring the good cause by faint-hearted conduct, should Timothy rather be ready to suffer, if need be, with St. Paul, ready to bear some shame with him, ready to incur, perhaps, sore danger for the gospel’s sake; and then St. Paul, emphasising his words, and strengthening with a new strength his argument and his exhortation, adds, “in accordance with the power of God”—yes, join with me in suffering, if needs be, for the gospel. Mighty and pitiful was God’s power towards us: great, surely, in proportion should be <span class= "ital">our</span> readiness to suffer in return, if He asks this—as He is now doing from you and me—at our hands.<p><span class= "bld">According to the power of God.</span>—What power of God? has been asked. <span class= "ital">Not</span> according to the power we get from God, but according to the power which God has displayed towards us in our calling and in our marvellous salvation. In other words, God, with great power, has succoured us; surely we may be confident that He will never leave us, never desert us, but in the hour of our sorest trouble incurred for Him will help us, and will bring us safely through it. So Chrysostom, who, while asserting that suffering will be borne, but not in our strength but in God’s, says, “Consider how thou hast been saved, and how thou hast been called;” inferring that He who has done so great things for man, in his calling and in his salvation, will never let him want for strength.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/1-8.htm" title="Be not you therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be you partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;...">2 Timothy 1:8-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Be not thou, therefore </span>— Discouraged by any dangers or trials; or <span class="ital">ashamed of the testimony of our Lord </span>— The gospel which testifies of Christ, or of testifying the truth and importance of it to all men; <span class="ital">nor of me his prisoner </span>— The cause of the servants of God, doing his work, cannot be separated from the cause of God himself. <span class="ital">But be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel </span>— Of such afflictions as I endure for the gospel’s sake: or, be ready to undergo the persecutions and troubles which attend the profession and preaching of the gospel: <span class="ital">according to the power of God </span>— That is, as God shall enable thee; <span class="ital">who hath saved us </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By faith in his Son and in his gospel, from sin and misery, present and eternal, and therefore we may the more readily endure any temporal evils for the gospel.

Nevertheless, as these things were but obscurely revealed in the ancient oracles, the far more clear discovery of them in the gospel, but especially Christ’s express promise to raise the dead, and give eternal life to believers, might with the greatest propriety be called a <span class="ital">making these things clear.” </span>The heathen also had some confused hopes of the immortality of the soul, but as they had no ground for these hopes but uncertain tradition and their own wishes, they were much in the dark concerning it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 God has not given us the spirit of fear, but the spirit of power, of courage and resolution, to meet difficulties and dangers; the spirit of love to him, which will carry us through opposition. And the spirit of a sound mind, quietness of mind. The Holy Spirit is not the author of a timid or cowardly disposition, or of slavish fears. We are likely to bear afflictions well, when we have strength and power from God to enable us to bear them. As is usual with Paul, when he mentions Christ and his redemption, he enlarges upon them; so full was he of that which is all our salvation, and ought to be all our desire. The call of the gospel is a holy call, making holy. Salvation is of free grace. This is said to be given us before the world began, that is, in the purpose of God from all eternity; in Christ Jesus, for all the gifts that come from God to sinful man, come in and through Christ Jesus alone. And as there is so clear a prospect of eternal happiness by faith in Him, who is the Resurrection and the Life, let us give more diligence in making his salvation sure to our souls. Those who cleave to the gospel, need not be ashamed, the cause will bear them out; but those who oppose it, shall be ashamed. The apostle had trusted his life, his soul, and eternal interests, to the Lord Jesus. No one else could deliver and secure his soul through the trials of life and death. There is a day coming, when our souls will be inquired after. Thou hadst a soul committed to thee; how was it employed? in the service of sin, or in the service of Christ? The hope of the lowest real Christian rests on the same foundation as that of the great apostle. He also has learned the value and the danger of his soul; he also has believed in Christ; and the change wrought in his soul, convinces the believer that the Lord Jesus will keep him to his heavenly kingdom. Paul exhorts Timothy to hold fast the Holy Scriptures, the substance of solid gospel truth in them. It is not enough to assent to the sound words, but we must love them. The Christian doctrine is a trust committed to us; it is of unspeakable value in itself, and will be of unspeakable advantage to us. It is committed to us, to be preserved pure and entire, yet we must not think to keep it by our own strength, but by the power of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us; and it will not be gained by those who trust in their own hearts, and lean to their own understandings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord - Do not be ashamed to bear your testimony to the doctrines taught by the Lord Jesus; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-32.htm">John 3:32-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-7.htm">John 7:7</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-22.htm">Acts 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-6.htm">1 Corinthians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16</a>.

Timothy knew that he had been thrown into prison on account of his love for the gospel.

The apostle evidently supposes that they who were subjected to trials on account of the gospel, might look for divine strength to uphold them, and asks him to endure those trials, relying on that strength, and not on his own. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. therefore&#8212;seeing that God hath given us such a spirit, not that of fear.<p>Be not thou &#8230; ashamed&#8212;I agree with Ellicott, in opposition to Alford, that the Greek subjunctive here, with the negative, implies action completed at one time, not continued action, which the present imperative would express; thus implying that Timothy had not decidedly yet evinced such feeling of shame; though I think, Paul, amidst the desertion of others who once promised fair, and from being aware of Timothy's constitutional timidity (see on [2494]2Ti 1:7), felt it necessary to stir him up and guard him against the possibility of unchristian dereliction of duty as to bold confession of Christ. Shame (2Ti 1:8) is the companion of fear (2Ti 1:7); if fear be overcome, false shame flees [Bengel]. Paul himself (2Ti 1:12), and Onesiphorus (2Ti 1:16), were instances of fearless profession removing false shame. He presents in contrast sad instances of fear and shame (2Ti 1:15).<p>of the testimony of our Lord&#8212;of the testimony which thou art bound to give in the cause of our Lord; he says "our," to connect Timothy and himself together in the testimony which both should give for their common Lord.

Timothy might easily be tempted to be ashamed of one in prison, especially as not only worldly shame, but great risk, attended any recognition of Paul the prisoner.<p>be thou partaker&#8212;with me.<p>of the gospel&#8212;rather, as Greek, "for the Gospel," that is, suffered for the Gospel (2Ti 2:3-5; Phm 13).<p>according to the power of God&#8212;exhibited in having saved and called us (2Ti 1:9).

The next verse, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ σώσαντος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., is not a detailed description of God’s power to save, but a recalling of the fact that Timothy had actually experienced God’s saving grace in the past.

The spirit of power and love must show itself in a brave, unflinching acceptance of all the hardships and afflictions incident to a faithful execution of his episcopal office (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Suffer hardship with the gospel.</span> This, of course, is a possible rendering, but an  unnatural one, and not at all in harmony with the context. The force of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;</span> in <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (only found here in the New Testament and in the R.T. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3</a>) is manifestly to associate Timothy with St. Paul in the afflictions of the gospel. "Be a fellow partaker with me of the afflictions," which is in obvious contrast with being ashamed of the testimony of the Lord and of the apostle his prisoner. <span class="accented">The gospel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the gospel, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, "striving for the faith of the gospel" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), and as Chrysostom explains it: <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (Huther). <span class="cmt_word">According to the power of God;</span> either "according to that spirit of power which God gave you at your ordination," or "according to the mighty power of God manifested in our salvation and in the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ."
