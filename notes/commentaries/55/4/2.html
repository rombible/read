St. Paul charged his friend and successor with awful solemnity, as we have seen, “preach,” or proclaim. loudly and publicly, as a herald would announce the accession of his king. The exact opposite to what St. Paul would urge on Timothy is described by Isa. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-10.htm" title="His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.">Isaiah 56:10</a>), when he speaks of God’s watchmen as “dumb dogs, who cannot bark, sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.”<p><span class= "bld">Be instant in season, out of season.</span>—Some difference exists between commentators respecting the exact meaning to be given to the Greek word translated “be instant.” Some would give it the sense of drawing nigh to, and as it is not specified in the text to whom Timothy should draw nigh, they supply from the context “the brethren,” those to whom the word is preached: “draw near to Christian assemblies.” It seems, however, best to understand this rather difficult word as an injunction to Timothy to be earnest and urgent generally in the whole work of his ministry: “Press on, in season, out of season.”<p><span class= "bld">In season, out of season.</span>—In other words, “For thy work, set apart no definite and fixed hours, no appointed times. Thy work must be done at all hours, at all times. Thy work has to be done not only when thou art in church, not merely in times of security and peace, but it must be carried on, in the midst of dangers, even if thou art a prisoner and in chains, even if death threaten thee.”<p>So Chrysostom—who also uses St. Paul’s words here as an urgent call to ministers to labour on in spite of discouragement and apparent failure—telling them in his own bright, eloquent way, how fountains still flow on, though no one goes to them to draw water, and rivers still run on, though no one drinks at them.<p>Augustine asks and answers the question to whom “in season” and to whom “out of season” refers: “in season” to those willing, “out of season” to the unwilling. This, however, only touches a portion of the thought of St. Paul, who urges on God’s true servants a restless, sleepless earnestness, which struggles on with the Master’s work in spite of bodily weakness and discouragement, in face of dangers and the bitterest opposition.<p><span class= "bld">Reprove.</span>—Not merely those erring in doctrine, but generally those who are blameworthy: “Was tadelnswerthist.”<p><span class= "bld">Rebuke.</span>—A sharper and more severe word than the preceding. It is used by St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-9.htm" title="Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke you.">Jude 1:9</a>, in his report of the words addressed by St. Michael to the devil: “The Lord rebuke thee.” It frequently occurs in the Gospels. (See, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-18.htm" title="And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the child was cured from that very hour.">Matthew 17:18</a>, “And Jesus rebuked the devil.”)<p><span class= "bld">Exhort.</span>—Not only is he to remember ceaselessly to watch over the flock, and to reprove and rebuke the erring and sinners, but also with no less diligence to speak comfortable words of encouragement and hope to all, especially the dispirited and sad-hearted.<p><span class= "bld">With all longsuffering and doctrine.</span>—The word translated “doctrine” signifies, rather, <span class= "ital">teaching.</span> He must reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all gentleness and patience; and in all this he must take care that “teaching”—the teaching which is right, and true, and full of hope—accompanies his rebuke and his words of comfort.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 People will turn away from the truth, they will grow weary of the plain gospel of Christ, they will be greedy of fables, and take pleasure in them. People do so when they will not endure that preaching which is searching, plain, and to the purpose. Those who love souls must be ever watchful, must venture and bear all the painful effects of their faithfulness, and take all opportunities of making known the pure gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Preach the word - The Word of God; the gospel. This was to be the main business of the life of Timothy, and Paul solemnly charges him in view of the certain coming of the Redeemer to judgment, to be faithful in the performance of it.<p>Be instant - see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-12.htm">Romans 12:12</a>. The meaning here is, that he should be constant in this duty. Literally, "to stand by, or to stand fast by;" that is, he was to be pressing or urgent in the performance of this work. He was always to be at his post, and was to embrace every opportunity of making known the gospel. What Paul seems to have contemplated was not merely, that he should perform the duty at stated and regular times; but that he should press the matter as one who had the subject much at heart, and never lose an opportunity of making the gospel known.<p>In season - &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  eukairo&#772;s. In good time; opportunely; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-16.htm">Matthew 26:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-6.htm">Luke 22:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-11.htm">Mark 14:11</a>. The sense is, when it could be conveniently done; when all things were favorable, and when there were no obstructions or hindrances. It may include the "stated and regular" seasons for public worship, but is not confined to them.<p>Out of season - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  akairo&#772;s. This word does not elsewhere occur in the New Testament. It is the opposite of the former, and means that a minister is to seek opportunities to preach the gospel even at such periods as might be inconvenient to himself, or when there might be hindrances and embarrassments, or when there was no stated appointment for preaching. He is not to confine himself to the appointed times of worship, or to preach only when it will be perfectly convenient for himself, but he is to have such an interest and earnestness in the work, that it will lead him to do it in the face of embarrassments and discouragements, and whenever he can find an opportunity. A man who is greatly intent on an object will seek every opportunity to promote it. He will not confine himself to stated times and places, but will present it everywhere, and at all times. A man, therefore, who merely confines himself to the stated seasons of preaching the gospel, or who merely preaches when it is convenient to himself, should not consider that he has come up to the requirement of the rule laid down by the apostle. He should preach in his private conversation, and in the intervals of his public labors, at the side of the sick bed, and wherever there is a prospect of doing good to any one. If his heart is full of love to the Saviour and to souls, he cannot help doing this.<p>Reprove - Or "convince;" See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>. The meaning is that he was to use such arguments as would "convince" men of the truth of religion, and of their own need of it.<p>Rebuke - Rebuke offenders; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-15.htm">Titus 2:15</a>; see the use of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-16.htm">Matthew 12:16</a>, (rendered "charged"); <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-18.htm">Matthew 17:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-13.htm">Matthew 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-31.htm">Matthew 20:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/4-35.htm">Luke 4:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-39.htm">Luke 4:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-13.htm">Luke 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-15.htm">Luke 18:15</a>; Jde 1:9. In the New Testament the word is used to express a judgment of what is wrong or contrary to one's will, and hence, to admonish or reprove. It implies our conviction that there is something evil, or some fault in him who is rebuked. The word in this verse rendered "reprove," does not imply this, but merely that one may be in error, and needs to have arguments presented to convince him of the truth. That word also implies no superior authority in him who does it. He presents "reasons, or argues" the case, for the purpose of convincing. The word here rendered rebuke, implies authority or superiority, and means merely that we may say that a thing is wrong, and administer a rebuke for it, as if there were no doubt that it was wrong. The propriety of the rebuke rests on our authority for doing it, not on the arguments which we present. This is based on the presumption that men often Know that they are doing wrong, and need no arguments to convince them of it. The idea is, that the minister is not merely to reason about sin, and convince men that it is wrong, but he may solemnly admonish them not to do it, and warn them of the consequences.<p>Exhort - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>.<p>With all long-suffering - That is, with a patient and persevering spirit if you are opposed; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>; compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-6.htm">2 Corinthians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-11.htm">Colossians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>.<p>And doctrine - Teaching, or patient instruction. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Preach&#8212;literally, "proclaim as a herald." The term for the discourses in the synagogue was daraschoth; the corresponding Greek term (implying dialectial style, dialogue, and discussion, Ac 17:2, 18; 18:4, 19) is applied in Acts to discourses in the Christian Church. Justin Martyr [Apology, 2], describes the order of public worship, "On Sunday all meet and the writings of the apostles and prophets are read; then the president delivers a discourse; after this all stand up and pray; then there is offered bread and wine and water; the president likewise prays and gives thanks, and the people solemnly assent, saying, Amen." The bishops and presbyters had the right and duty to preach, but they sometimes called on deacons, and even laymen, to preach. Eusebius [Ecclesiastical History, 6.19]; in this the Church imitated the synagogue (Lu 4:17-22; Ac 13:15, 16).<p>be instant&#8212;that is, urgent, earnest, in the whole work of the ministry.<p>in season, out of season&#8212;that is, at all seasons; whether they regard your speaking as seasonable or unseasonable. "Just as the fountains, though none may draw from them, still flow on; and the rivers, though none drink of them, still run; so must we do all on our part in speaking, though none give heed to us" [Chrysostom, Homily, 30, vol. 5., p. 221]. I think with Chrysostom, there is included also the idea of times whether seasonable or unseasonable to Timothy himself; not merely when convenient, but when inconvenient to thee, night as well as day (Ac 20:31), in danger as well as in safety, in prison and when doomed to death as well as when at large, not only in church, but everywhere and on all occasions, whenever and wherever the Lord's work requires it.<p>reprove&#8212;"convict," "confute."<p>with, &c.&#8212;Greek, "IN (the element in which the exhortation ought to have place) all long-suffering (2Ti 2:24, 25; 3:10) and teaching"; compare 2Ti 2:24, "apt to teach." The Greek for "doctrine" here is didache, but in 2Ti 3:16, didascalia. "Didascalia" is what one receives; "didache" is what is communicated [Tittmann].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Preach; </span> proclaim like a herald, cry like a common crier in the hearing of a multitude.

Either Christ the essential Word, who is the sum and substance of the Gospel ministry; or the word of truth and faith, the Gospel of salvation, the word of righteousness, peace, and reconciliation by Christ; which is to be preached, or published, in like manner as heralds proclaim the will of their princes; openly, publicly, and with a loud voice, without adding to it, or taking from speaking out the whole, and keeping back no part of it; and that with all courage and boldness: some copies read, "the word of God"; and the Ethiopic version, "his word"; that is, the word of Christ: <p>be instant in season, out of season; that is, be constant and assiduous in the work of the ministry; be always and wholly in it, either preparing for it, or performing it; or doing those things which are annexed to it, or follow upon it; redeem time, and take every opportunity of dispensing the mysteries of grace, as a faithful steward of them; not only make use of the common and stated seasons for the ministration of the word and ordinances, but embrace every other that offers; make use not only of those seasons which may seem commodious and advantageous both to preacher and hearer, and promise usefulness and success, but even such as may seem incommodious and disadvantageous to flesh and blood; such as times of persecution and opposition; but none of these things should deter and move from the preaching of the Gospel. Several parts of the ministerial function to be insisted on and attended to are next mentioned, as being within the solemn charge given before God and Christ: <p>reprove; errors, and men for their errors and heresies; make use of convincing arguments taken out of the Scriptures, which are profitable for reproof of this kind; and which reproof sometimes is to be given with sharpness, as the case requires, that men may be sound in the faith. <p>Rebuke; or chide for sin; some privately, others more publicly, according to the nature and circumstances of the offence; some more gently, others more roughly, as is needful. <p>Exhort; to all the duties of religion respecting God and man; to show love, and to do good works; to hold fast the profession of faith, and walk as becomes the Gospel of Christ; and to persevere in faith and holiness: or "comfort", as the word may be rendered; for as the ministers of the Gospel are in some cases to be "Boanergeses", sons of thunder, so other cases they should be Barnabases, sons of consolation; and comfort distressed minds, by preaching the comfortable doctrines of peace, pardon, righteousness and salvation by Jesus Christ: <p>with all longsuffering: or patience. The success of the Gospel ministry should be patiently waited for as husbandmen do for the fruits of the earth. Those that give into error, and oppose themselves to the truth, should be instructed in meekness; and those who are overtaken in a fault should be gently rebuked, and restored in such a spirit; and every exhortation should be pressed as persons are able to bear it: <p>and doctrine; in a way that is instructive and teaching, and in agreement with the doctrine of the Scriptures, which are profitable for that purpose. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-2.htm" title="Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.">2 Timothy 4:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">κήρυξον</span>: In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm" title="I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.">1 Timothy 5:21</a> <span class="greekheb">διαμαρτ</span>. is followed by <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> with the subj.; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-14.htm" title="Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.">2 Timothy 2:14</a> by the inf.

Pricæus has collected these examples, and more, all of which do not rest on the same footing as the example in the text.

Sometimes the sense of "exhort," and sometimes that of "comfort," predominates (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>, etc.).

For "teaching" or "doctrine" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>), St. Paul more frequently uses <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the pastoral Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-10.htm">1 Timothy 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-6.htm">1 Timothy 4:6, 13, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>; ch. 3:10, 16, etc.); but there does not seem to be any great difference of meaning. Possibly <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> points more to the act of teaching. The use of it here, coupled with "long suffering," directs that the man of God, whether he preaches, reproves, rebukes, or exhorts, is always to be a patient teacher of God's Word and truth. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Be instant (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;)<p>Better, be ready.

Mostly in the Synoptic Gospels, where it is frequent.

The word implies a sharp, severe rebuke, with, possibly, a suggestion in some cases of impending penalty (&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;); charge on pain of. This might go to justify the rendering of Holtzmann and von Soden, threaten.

The combination is suggestive. Longsuffering is to be maintained against the temptations to anger presented by the obstinacy and perverseness of certain hearers; and such are to be met, not merely with rebuke, but also with sound and reasonable instruction in the truth. So Calvin: "Those who are strong only in fervor and sharpness, but are not fortified with solid doctrine, weary themselves in their vigorous efforts, make a great noise, rave,... make no headway because they build without foundation." Men will not be won to the truth by scolding. "They should understand what they hear, and learn by perceive why they are rebuked" (Bahnsen). &#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769; teaching, only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-9.htm">Titus 1:9</a> in Pastorals.
