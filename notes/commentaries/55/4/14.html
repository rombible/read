God might justly be angry with them, but he prays God to forgive them. The apostle was delivered out of the mouth of the lion, that is, of Nero, or some of his judges.

This need not be regarded as an expression of private feeling; still less should it be understood as expressing a desire of revenge. It is the language of one who wished that God would treat him exactly as he ought to be treated, and might be in accordance with the highest benevolence of any heart. It is the aim of every just government that every one should be treated exactly as he deserves; and every good citizen should desire and pray that exact justice may be done to all. It is the business of a police officer to ferret out the guilty, to bring them to trial, to secure a just sentence; and any police officer might "pray," with the utmost propriety, that God would assist him in his endeavors, and enable him to perform his duty. This might be done with no malevolent feeling toward any human being, but with the purest love of country, and the most earnest desire for the welfare of all.<p>if such a police officer, or if a judge, or a juryman, were heard thus to pray, who would dare to accuse him of having a vindictive spirit, or a malevolent heart? And why should Paul be so charged, when his prayer amounts to no more than this? For it remains yet to be proved that he refers to any private wrong which Alexander had done him, or that he was actuated by any other desire than that the sacred interests of truth should be guarded, and equal justice done to all. Why is it wrong to desire or to pray that universal justice may be done, and that every man may be treated as, under all the circumstances of the case, he ought to be treated? On the subject of the "Imprecations in the Scriptures," the reader may consult an article in the Bibliotheca Sacra, vol. 1, pp. 97-110. It should be added here, that some manuscripts, instead of &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#837;&#x3b7;  apodo&#772;e&#772;, "may the Lord reward," read it in the future - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  apodo&#772;sei, "will reward." See Wetstein. The future is also found in the Vulgate, Coptic, and in Augustine, Theodoret, and Chrysostom. Augustine says (on the Sermon on the Mount), "He does not say, may he reward (reddat); but, he will reward (reddet), which is a verb of prophecy, not of imprecation. The authority, however, is not sufficient to justify a change in the present reading. These variations have doubtless arisen from a belief that the common reading expresses a sentiment inconsistent with the true spirit of a Christian, and a desire to find a better. But there is no reason for "desiring" a change in the text. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

This must, however, be added to an attitude of opposition to his words, as is shown in the words: <span class="greekheb">λίαν γὰρ ἀντέστη τοῖς ἡμετέροις λόγοις</span>] It is doubtful where this was done, and where Alexander was at the time of the composition of this epistle. Further, the warning: <span class="greekheb">ὃν καὶ σὺ φυλάσσου</span>, may refer both “to Timothy’s presence in Ephesus and to his future stay in Rome” (de Wette). Wiesinger conjectures that this Alexander, a native of Ephesus, had come from there to Rome to give testimony against the apostle (at his <span class="greekheb">πρώτη ἀπολογία</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-16.htm" title="At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.">2 Timothy 4:16</a>), and had afterwards returned to Ephesus.[68] This conjecture obtains some probability from the fact that in the very next verse Paul speaks of the <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογία</span>; but this fact cannot be regarded as making the matter certain. The words preceding this warning, if we read <span class="greekheb">ἀποδώσει αὐτῷ ὁ κύριος κατὰ τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ</span>, present no difficulty. Even with the reading <span class="greekheb">ἀποδώῃ</span> they cannot form a reason for reproaching the apostle with a desire for vengeance; Christian love does not extinguish the feeling of justice; besides, the apostle does not speak the words because of the personal injury, but because of Alexander’s hostility to the truth. Justin (<span class="ital">quaest.</span> 125, <span class="ital">ad Orthod.</span>) says of these words: <span class="greekheb">πρέπουσα ἀνδρὶ ἀποστόλῳ μὴ ἐκδικοῦντι ἑαυτὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ διδόντι τόπον τῇ ὀργῇ</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.">Romans 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1 Peter 2:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[68] Hofmann supposes that this Alexander was the same as the one mentioned in Acts 19., and that he had given testimony against the apostle in Ephesus. The opinion is manifestly too far-fetched, that Luke would not have mentioned him in the Acts, if the Roman Theophilus, for whom in the first place he wrote the Acts, “had not known Alexander from some other source, in the manner in which we make acquaintance with him in the passage before us.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/2_timothy/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:...">2 Timothy 4:14-15</a>.

Dr Farrar’s suggestion for the link of connexion is possible, that St Paul’s second arrest took place at Troas, and that such an one as Alexander the coppersmith could easily have procured his arrest, and when suddenly seized by the lictors at Troas he could have had no time to take away his possessions. On <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1 Timothy 1:20</a> we have seen that there is no particular reason to identify this Alexander with the one mentioned there.

It seems probable, though it is necessarily uncertain, that this Alexander is the same person as that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a> as "a blasphemer," which agrees exactly with what is here said of him, "he greatly withstood our words" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>, "contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed"). He may or may not be the same as the Alexander named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a>. Supposing the Alexander of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a> and this place to be the same, the points of resemblance with the Alexander of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a> are that both resided at Ephesus, that both seem to have been Christians (see note on 1 Timothy 1:20), and both probably Jews, inasmuch as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1.htm">1 Timothy 1</a> relates entirely to Jewish heresies (vers. 4, 7, 8), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a> expressly states that he was a Jew. <span class="cmt_word">The coppersmith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>; only here in the New Testament); properly, <span class="accented">a coppersmith</span>, but used generally of any smith - silversmith, or goldsmith, or blacksmith. <span class="cmt_word">Did me much evil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). This is a purely Hellenistic idiom, and is found in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-15.htm">Genesis 50:15, 17</a>; Song of the Three Children, 19; 2 Macc. 13:9.

The question naturally arises - When and where did Alexander thus injure St. Paul? - at Ephesus or at Rome? Bengel suggests Rome, and with great probability. Perhaps he did him evil by stirring up the Jews at Rome against the apostle at the time of "his first defence;" or by giving adverse testimony before the Roman tribunal, possibly accusing him of being seditious, and bringing up the riot at Ephesus as a proof of it; or in some other way, of which the memory has perished. <span class="cmt_word">Will render.</span> The R.T. has the future, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> for the optative <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span>, "a late and incorrect form for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;</span> (Ellicott, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Alexander the coppersmith<p>Comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a>.
