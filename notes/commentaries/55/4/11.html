Most likely this close intimacy and long-continued association was owing to the Apostle’s weak and infirm health—to that dying body—the noble Paul ever bore about with him. Luke was with St. Paul, we know, in his second missionary journey, and again in his third missionary journey; he accompanied him to Asia, and then to Jerusalem; was with him during the captivity time of Cæsarea, and subsequently of Rome, the first time St. Paul was imprisoned in the capital (Acts 18). After St. Paul’s death, Epiphanius speaks of him as preaching chiefly in Gaul; a very general tradition includes him among the martyrs of the first age of the Church. The name is probably a contraction of Lucanus. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction</span> <span class= "ital">to the Acts of the Apostles.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</span>—“But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them . . . and went not with them to the work” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a>). There is something strangely touching in this message of the aged master to Timothy to bring with him on that last solemn journey one whom, some quarter of a century before, St. Paul had judged so severely, and on whose account he had separated from his old loved friend, Barnabas the Apostle. Since that hour when the young missionary’s heart had failed him in Pamphylia, Mark had, by steady, earnest work, won back his place in St. Paul’s heart. Barnabas, we know, when his brother Apostle rejected him, took him with him to Cyprus. After some twelve years, we find him, during the first imprisonment, with St. Paul at Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>). He is mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>) by the endearing term of “my son,” and the unanimous traditions of the ancient Christian writers represent him as the secretary or amanuensis of St. Peter. It was his office to commit to writing the orally delivered instructions and narrations of his master. These, in some revised and arranged form, probably under the direction of Peter himself, were given to the Church under the title of St. Mark’s Gospel. A later and uncertain tradition says he subsequently became first Bishop of Alexandria, and there suffered martyrdom.<p><span class= "bld">For he is profitable to me for the ministry.</span>—Profitable, according to the suggestion of Grotius, owing to Mark’s knowledge of the Latin tongue. This is possible; but it is more likely that he was profitable or serviceable as an assistant who was well acquainted with the details of St. Paul’s many sided work.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:9-13 The love of this world, is often the cause of turning back from the truths and ways of Jesus Christ. Paul was guided by Divine inspiration, yet he would have his books. As long as we live, we must still learn. The apostles did not neglect human means, in seeking the necessaries of life, or their own instruction. Let us thank the Divine goodness in having given us so many writings of wise and pious men in all ages; and let us seek that by reading them our profiting may appear to all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Only Luke is with me - Luke, the author of the gospel which bears his name, and of the Acts of the Apostles. For a considerable part of the ministry of Paul, he was his traveling companion (compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10</a>), and we know that he went with him to Rome; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-1.htm">Acts 27:1</a>.<p>Take Mark - John Mark, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37</a>. He was the son of a sister of Barnabas, and had been the traveling companion of Barnabas and Paul. There had been a temporary alienation between Paul and him <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-38.htm">Acts 15:38</a>; but this passage proves that that had been removed, and that Paul was reconciled to him.<p>For he is profitable to me for the ministry - In what way he would be profitable, he does not say; nor is it known why Mark was at that time with Timothy. It may be observed, however, that this is such language as Paul might be expected to use of Mark, after what had occurred, as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-38.htm">Acts 15:38</a>. He felt that he was now about to die. If he suspected that there was on the part of Mark any lingering apprehension that the great apostle was not entirely reconciled to him, or retained a recollection of what had formerly occurred, nothing would be more natural than that, at this trying time of his life, Paul should summon him to his side, and express toward him the kindest emotions. It would soothe any lingering irritation in the mind of Mark, to receive such a message. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Take&#8212;Greek, "take up" on thy journey (Ac 20:13, 14). John Mark was probably in, or near, Colosse, as in the Epistle to the Colossians (Col 4:10), written two years before this, he is mentioned as about to visit them. Timothy was now absent from Ephesus and somewhere in the interior of Asia Minor; hence he would be sure to fall in with Mark on his journey.<p>he is profitable to me for the ministry&#8212;Mark had been under a cloud for having forsaken Paul at a critical moment in his missionary tour with Barnabas (Ac 15:37-40; 13:5, 13). Timothy had subsequently occupied the same post in relation to Paul as Mark once held. Hence Paul, appropriately here, wipes out the past censure by high praise of Mark and guards against Timothy's making self-complacent comparisons between himself and Mark, as though he were superior to the latter (compare Phm 24). Demas apostatizes. Mark returns to the right way, and is no longer unprofitable, but is profitable for the Gospel ministry (Phm 11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Only Luke is with me</span>; of whom we also read <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-14.htm" title=" Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.">Colossians 4:14</a></span>.

R.V. rightly throughout ‘Mark’ (Lightfoot, <span class="ital">N. T.

He and his mother must have been well known to St Peter, who went to her house straight from the prison; and the phrase ‘Mark my son’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1 Peter 5:13</a> makes it probable that he was converted by that Apostle.

A reconciliation must have taken place before we next hear of him, as he is reckoned by St Paul in the first imprisonment at Rome as one of his ‘fellow labourers unto the kingdom’ who have been ‘a comfort’ unto him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>.

His Gospel must have been written between a.d. 63 and a.d. 70; according to Irenæus, after the deaths of St Peter and St Paul; according to Jerome, ‘Peter relating and Mark writing.’ See Maclear’s Introduction to St Mark’s Gospel, pp. 14, 15, &c. As especially in keeping (by undesigned coincidence) with what we have seen above of St Mark’s own fall and restoration and his slow advance to settled power as a ‘fellow labourer unto the kingdom’ and ‘profitable to the ministry,’ we should observe (if it has not been noticed in this connexion before) what significance the two parables and the one miracle have which are recorded only by St Mark. They are the healing of the deaf and dumb man at Decapolis, with the <span class="ital">five stages</span> in his gradual cure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-31.htm" title="And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the coasts of Decapolis.">Mark 7:31</a>), the healing of the blind man at Bethsaida, with the <span class="ital">four</span> successive stages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-22.htm" title="And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man to him, and sought him to touch him.">Mark 8:22</a>), and the parable of the seed growing secretly and slowly, ‘<span class="ital">first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear</span>’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-26.htm" title="And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground;">Mark 4:26</a>). Among the many lessons learnt from Christ, through St Peter, <span class="ital">this</span> laid hold of St Mark; it fitted his need, gave him good hope and heart that he could indeed ‘rise on stepping-stones of his dead self’ to a new and higher life; and what he thus found so true in his own case he could not but put on record, to be a ‘profitable ministry’ through the Holy Spirit to very many ‘feeble-hearts,’ who like him have become ‘great-hearts’ and ‘lion-hearts’ for Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Companion of the Saints! ’twas thine<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To taste that drop of peace divine,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>When the great soldier of thy Lord<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Call’d thee to take his last farewell,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Teaching the Church with joy to tell<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The story of your love restored.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The Christian Year</span>, ‘St Mark’s Day.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">profitable … for the ministry</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">serviceable for ministering</span>. Observe the emphatic position of the verb ‘for he is,’ almost implying ‘whatever he once may have been’: primarily this ministering would be to himself, as Erastus and Timothy are designated ‘ministers unto him,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm" title="So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered to him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.">Acts 19:22</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/2_timothy/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me.

How he spent his time between that date and the mention of him here as still with St. Paul, we have no knowledge. But it looks as if he may have been in close personal attendance upon him all the time. if he had been permitted to write a supplement to the Acts, perhaps the repeated "we" would have shown this. <span class="cmt_word">Take Mark.</span> Mark had apparently been recently reconciled to St. Paul when he wrote <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, and was with him when he wrote <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>. We know nothing more of him till we learn from this passage that he was with or near to Timothy, and likely to accompany him to Rome in his last visit to St. Paul. He is mentioned again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>, as being with St. Peter at Babylon. The expression, "take" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>), seems to imply that Timothy was to pick him up on the way, as the word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-13.htm">Acts 20:13, 14</a>; and, though less certainly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-31.htm">Acts 23:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He is useful to me,</span> etc. (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as ch. 2:21 (where see note). This testimony to Mark's ministerial usefulness, at a time when his faithfulness and courage would be put to a severe test, is very satisfactory. <span class="cmt_word">For ministering</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). It may be doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> here means "the ministry," as in the A.V. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>, or, as in the R.V., more generally "for ministering," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for acting as an assistant to me in my apostolic labours. The words, "to me," favour the latter rendering. The sense would then be the same as that of the verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>, where we read that Timothy and Erastus "ministered unto him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to St. Paul, and that of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> applied to Mark in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Luke<p>See Introd. to Luke. His connection with Paul appears first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10</a>.

He accompanied Paul to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-15.htm">Acts 21:15</a>), after which we lose sight of him until he appears at Caesarea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>), whence he accompanies Paul to Rome.

The first mention of him since the separation from Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-39.htm">Acts 15:39</a>) occurs in Colossians and Philemon. He is commended to the church at Colossae. In 1st Peter he sends salutations to Asia. In both Colossians and Philemon his name appears along with that of Demas. In Colossians he is named shortly before Luke and along with Aristarchus who does not appear here. He (Mark) is about to come to Asia where 2nd Timothy finds him. The appearance in Colossians of Aristarchus with Mark and of Demas with Luke is probably the point of connection with the representation in 2ndTimothy.<p>Profitable for the ministry (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>&#x395;&#788;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; profitable, only here, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>, Plm 1:11.
