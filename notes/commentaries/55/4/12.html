I need one who is profitable (or <span class= "ital">serviceable</span>) for the ministry. I had one in Tychicus, <span class= "ital">but</span> he is gone” (Ellicott). Neither the period of Tychicus’ journey nor its object is alluded <span class= "ital">to</span> here. It probably took place some time, however, before the sending of this Epistle to Timothy. Tychicus was evidently one of the trusted companions of St. Paul. He had been with him, we know, on his third missionary journey, and had, during St. Paul’s first Roman imprisonment, some six or seven years before, been charged with a mission by his master to Ephesus. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm" title="But that you also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:">Ephesians 6:21</a> he is called a beloved brother and a faithful minister in the Lord. (See, too, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:">Colossians 4:7</a>, where he is spoken of in similar terms.) On the city of Ephesus, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm" title="As I sought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,">1Timothy 1:3</a>. It has been, with considerable probability, suggested that Tychicus had been the bearer of the first Epistle to Timothy. Between the writing of these two letters, we know, no great interval could have elapsed.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:9-13 The love of this world, is often the cause of turning back from the truths and ways of Jesus Christ.

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a>, Paul calls him "a beloved brother, and faithful minister in the Lord." But it may be asked why he did not retain him with him, or why should he have sent him away, and then call Timothy to him? The probability is, that he had sent him before he had seen reason to apprehend that he would be put to death; and now, feeling the need of a friend to be with him, he sent to Timothy, rather than to him, because Tychicus had been employed to perform some service which he could not well leave, and because Paul wished to give some some special instructions to Timothy before he died.<p>Have I sent to Ephesus - Why, is not certainly known; compare Intro.

Otto thinks that this was the occasion mentioned here, and tries to prove it particularly by an interpretation of the passages quoted from the Epistles to the Colossians and the Ephesians. There are, however, well-founded objections to his theory. The facts are such, the two occasions on which he was sent can obviously not be identical.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς Ἔφεσον</span>] Paul here mentions Ephesus as the place to which he had sent Tychicus; but we cannot infer from this, as Theodoret and de Wette infer, that Timothy had not at that time lived in Ephesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reason why he was sent is not given.

Demas had <span class="ital">forsaken</span> the apostle; and Crescens and Titus had <span class="ital">gone</span>, perhaps on their own initiative; Tychicus had been <span class="ital">sent away</span> by St. Paul himself.

St. Paul had mentioned the places to which Demas, etc., had gone; and even on the supposition that St. Paul knew that Tychicus was with Timothy, he could not say, “I sent away Tychicus” without completing the sentence by adding the destination. This explanation must be adopted, if we suppose with Ell. that Tychicus was the bearer of <span class="ital">First Timothy</span>. If he were the bearer of <span class="ital">Second Timothy</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀπέστειλα</span> can be plausibly explained as the epistolary aorist. On the other hand, there is no reason why we should assume that Timothy was at Ephesus at this time. Other local references, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This you know, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.">2 Timothy 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-18.htm" title="The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.">2 Timothy 1:18</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-13.htm" title="The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when you come, bring with you, and the books, but especially the parchments.">2 Timothy 4:13</a> are quite consistent with a belief that he was not actually in that city. Perhaps “Do the work of an evangelist” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm" title="But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.">2 Timothy 4:5</a>) is an indication that he was itinerating.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_timothy/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">Tychicus</span>] The accent of the word shews it to be formed from the noun for ‘chance’; as with us a common surname is Chance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Tychicus, a native of proconsular Asia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>), went with St Paul on the third missionary journey to Jerusalem, perhaps as a delegate from his own Church; was with him towards the close of the first imprisonment at Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:">Colossians 4:7</a>); after the release was again with him on the way to Nicopolis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm" title="When I shall send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.">Titus 3:12</a>); and now just before his death is sent to Ephesus.

The presence of Luke, Timothy, Tychicus, Mark, with Paul now, as then, is remarkable (see ver. 10, note). <span class="cmt_word">I sent to Ephesus.</span> Theodoret (quoted by Alford, 'Proleg. to 2 Timothy,' ch. 9. sect. 1) says, "It is plain from this that St. Timothy was not at this time living at Ephesus, but somewhere else." And that certainly is the natural inference at first sight. But Bishop Ellicott suggests the possibility of Tychicus being the bearer of the First Epistle to Timothy, written not very long before, and this being merely an allusion to that well known fact. Another and more probable idea is that he was the bearer of this Epistle, that the object of his mission, like that of Artemas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>), was to take Timothy's place at Ephesus during Timothy's absence at Rome, and that he is thus mentioned in the Epistle in order to commend him to the reverent regard of the Ephesian Church (Wordsworth). It is argued against this that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> would have been the more natural expression after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>. But this objection would be removed if we suppose that the Epistle was sent by another hand, and that it was very possible that Timothy might have started for Rome before Tychicus could arrive at Ephesus. He might have orders to visit Corinth or Macedonia on his way. (For the arguments for and against Timothy being at Ephesus at this time, see Alford's 'Proleg.,' as above.) <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Tychicus<p>A comparatively uncommon name in N.T., but found in inscriptions of Asia Minor and on Asiatic coins.
