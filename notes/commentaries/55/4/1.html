Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2Timothy 4:11</a>), the faithful friend, was writing to the Apostle’s dictation, was nearly filled up. What has still to be said to the chief presbyter of the Church of Ephesus must be brief. But St. Paul would have the last words introduced by a most impressive preface. So before he sums up his directions and exhortations, he appeals to him in these stately and solemn words. The Greek word rendered “I charge (thee),” is more accurately translated by, <span class= "ital">I solemnly charge </span>(<span class= "ital">thee</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>before those divine witnesses, the Eternal Father and the Blessed Son, present with me in this prison of mine in Rome, present equally with you in study-chamber or church in Asia.<p><span class= "bld">Who shall judge the quick and the dead.</span>—These words must have sounded with strange power in the ears of men like Timothy, and must have impressed them with an intense feeling of responsibility. The Apostle in his divine wisdom was charging these teachers of the Church to be faithful and zealous in their work, by the thought, which must be ever present, that <span class= "ital">they</span>—either alive on the day of the Coming of the Lord, or, if they had tasted death already, raised from the dead incorruptible (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1Thessalonians 4:17</a>)—must stand before the Judge and give an account of their stewardship; on that awful morning must every man and woman render up, before the Judge who knows all and sees all, a strict account of the deeds done in the body. The looking forward to the judgment morning must surely be a spur to any faint-hearted, dispirited servant of the Lord disposed to temporise, or reluctant to face the dangers which threaten a faithful discharge of duties.<p><span class= "bld">At his appearing and his kingdom.</span>—The older authorities here—instead of the preposition “at”—read “and.” The rendering then would be: “I charge thee in the sight of God and Jesus Christ, who will judge quick and dead (I charge thee) by His appearing (<span class= "ital">epiphany</span>) and by His kingdom,” the construction in Greek being the usual accusative of adjuration, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-7.htm" title="And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the most high God? I adjure you by God, that you torment me not.">Mark 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.">Acts 19:13</a>. So, too, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-26.htm" title="I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.">Deuteronomy 4:26</a> (LXX.): “I solemnly charge you to-day by heaven and earth.” The passage, by this restoration of the ancient, and, at first sight, more difficult reading, gains, as we shall see, immeasurably in strength and power. “By his appearing,” or by His manifestation or epiphany, refers, of course, to the Lord’s coming a second time to judge the earth in the glory of the Father with His angels. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm" title="For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>.) “And by His kingdom:” His kingdom, that kingdom is here meant which, in the words of the Nicene Creed, “shall have no end.” This glorious sovereignty of Christ is to succeed what Pearson (<span class= "ital">Creed, </span>Article VI., p. 529, Chevallier’s edit.) calls “the modificated eternity of His mediatorship,” which will end when all His enemies shall have been subdued, and He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father. The “kingdom” here spoken of is to commence at Christ’s glorious epiphany or manifestation, when “the kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ; and He shall reign for ever and ever” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15</a>). Timothy was conjured by the “appearing” of Christ when he would have to stand before Him and be judged; he was conjured, too, by “His kingdom,” in which glorious state Timothy hoped to share, for was it not promised that His own should reign with Him? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-12.htm" title="If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:">2Timothy 2:12</a>.) There seems in this solemn ringing adjuration something which reminds us of “a faithful saying.” The germs at least of one of the ancient creeds are apparent here, where allusion is made to God (the Father) and to Jesus Christ, the judge of quick and dead, to His coming again with glory and then to His kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/2_timothy/4.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>2 Timothy<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>LIGHT AT EVENTIDE</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-1.htm" title="I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;...">2 Timothy 4:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-16.htm" title="At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge....">2 Timothy 4:16-18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>TIMOTHY does not appear to have been a strong man, either in body or mind, if we may judge from the exhortations and tonics which Paul felt it needful to administer in this letter. The young, gentle soul was more overwhelmed by Paul’s trial and impending death than the heroic martyr himself was. Nothing shook that steadfast heart, and from the very grave’s mouth he spoke brave encouragement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Verses 1-5 are a rousing appeal to Timothy to fulfil his ministry. Embedded in it there is a sad prophecy of coming dark days for the Church, which constitutes, not a reason for despondency or for abandoning the work, but for doing it with all one’s might. But the all-powerful motive for every Christian teacher, whether of old or young, is pressed on Timothy in the solemn thoughts that he works in the sight of God and of Jesus, and that he and those to whom he speaks, and whose blood may be laid to his charge, are to see him when he appears, and to stand at his judgment bar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The master’s eye makes diligent servants; the tremendous issues for speaker and hearer suspended on the preaching of the gospel, if they were ever burning before our inward vision, would make superfluous all other motives for straining every nerve and using every opportunity and power. How we should preach and teach and live if the great white throne and He who will sit on it were ever shining before us! Would not that sight burn up slothfulness, cowardice, perfunctory discharge of duty, mechanical repetition of scarcely felt words, and all the other selfishnesses and worldlinesses which sap our earnestness in our work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The special duties enjoined are, first and foremost, the most general one to ‘preach the word,’ which is, indeed, a duty incumbent on all Christians; and then, subordinate to it, and descriptive of how it is to be done, the duty of persevering attention to that great life task - ‘be instant’; that is, be at it, be always at it. But is not ‘in season, out of season’ an unwise and dangerous precept? Do we not do more harm than good by thrusting gospel teaching down people’s throats at unfitting times? No doubt tact and prudence are as needful as zeal, but perhaps they are rather more abundant at present than it, and at a time that looks out of season to a man who does not wish to hear of Christ at any time, or to one who does not wish to speak of Him at any time, may be ‘in season’ for the very reason that it seems out of season. Felix is not an infallible judge of ‘a convenient season.’ It would do no harm if Christian people ‘obtruded’ their religion a little more.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the general work of ‘preaching the word’ is to be accompanied with special care over the life of believers, which is to be active in three closely connected forms. Timothy is, where needful, to ‘convict’ of sin; for so the word rendered ‘reprove’ means, as applied to the mission of the Comforter in <431608><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>. ‘Rebuke’ naturally follows conviction, and exhortation, or, rather, consolation or encouragement, as naturally follows rebuke. If the faithful teacher has sometimes to use the lancet, he must have the balm and the Bandage at hand. And this triple ministry is to be ‘with all longsuffering’ and ‘teaching.’ Chry-sostom beautifully comments, ‘Not as in anger, not as in hatred, not as insulting over him,... as loving, as sympathising, as more distressed than himself at his grief.’ And we may add, as letting ‘the teaching’ do the convicting and rebuking, not the teacher’s judgment or tongue.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The prospect of dark days coming, which so often saddens the close of a strenuous life for Christ and the Church, shadowed Paul’s spirit, and .added to his burdens. At Ephesus he had spoken forebodings of ‘grievous wolves’ entering in after his death, and now he feels that he will be powerless to check the torrent of corruption, and is eager that, when he is gone, Timothy and others may be wise and brave to cope with the tendencies to turn from the simple truth and to prefer ‘fables.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The picture which he draws is true to-day. Healthful teaching is distasteful Men’s ears itch, and want to be tickled. The desire of the multitude is to have teachers who will reflect their own opinions and prejudices, who will not go against the grain or rub them the wrong way, who will flatter the mob which itself the people, and will keep ‘conviction’ and ‘rebuke’ well in the background. That is no reason for any Christian teacher’s being cast down, but is a reason for his buckling to his work, and not shunning to declare the whole counsel of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The true way to front and conquer these tendencies is by the display of an unmistakable self-sacrifice in the life, by sobriety in all things and willing endurance of hardship where needful, and by redoubled earnestness in proclaiming the gospel, which men need whether they want it or not, and by filling to the full the sphere of our work, and discharging all its obligations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The final words in verses 16-18 carry on the triumphant strain. There had been some previous stage of Paul’s trial, in his second imprisonment, of which we have no details except those here - when the Roman Christians and all his friends had deserted him, and that he had thus been conformed unto Christ’s sufferings, and tasted the bitterness of friendship failing when needed most. But no trace of bitterness remained in his spirit, and, like his Lord, he prayed for them who had thus deserted him. He was left alone, but the Christ, who had borne his burden alone, died that none of His servants might ever have to know the same dreary solitude, and the absence of other comforters had made the more room, as well as need, for Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul’s predecessor, Stephen, had seen Jesus standing at the right hand of God. Paul had an even more blessed experience; for Jesus stood by him, there in the Roman court, in which, perhaps, the emperors ate on the tribunal What could terrify him with that Advocate at his side?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But it is beautiful that the Apostle does not first think of his Lord’s presence as ministering to his comfort, but as nerving him to ‘fulfil His message.’ The trial was to him, first, a crowning opportunity of preaching the gospel, and, no doubt, it gave him an audience of such a sort as he had never had. What did it matter even to himself what became of him, if ‘ all the Gentiles,’ and among them, no doubt, senators, generals, statesmen, and possibly Nero, ‘might bear’? Only as a second result of Christ’s help does he add that he was rescued, as from between the very teeth of the lion. The peril was extreme; his position seemed hopeless, the jaws were wide open, and he was held by the sharp fangs, but Christ dragged him out. The true David delivered his lamb out of the lion’s mouth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The past is the prophecy of the future to those that trust in a changeless Christ, who has all the resources of the universe at command. ‘That which hath been is that which shall be,’ and he who can say ‘he hath delivered from so great a death’ ought to have no hesitation in adding’ in whom I trust that He will yet deliver me.’ That was the use that Paul made of his experience, and so his last words are an utterance of unfaltering faith and a doxology.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There appears to be an interesting echo of the Lord’s Prayer in verse 18. Observe the words ‘deliver,’ ‘from evil,’ ‘kingdom,’ ‘glory.’ Was Paul’s confidence disappointed? No; for surely he was delivered from every evil work, when the sharp sword struck off his head as he knelt outside thewalls of Rome. And Death was Christ’s last messenger, sent to ‘save him unto His heavenly kingdom,’ that there he might, with loftier words than even he could utter on earth, ascribe to Him ‘glory for ever. Amen.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-1.htm" title="I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;...">2 Timothy 4:1-4</a></span>. Having, in the preceding chapter, explained to Timothy the duties of his office, as an evangelist, the apostle now proceeds solemnly to charge him, in the presence of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to be diligent and faithful in all the duties of the ministry; by preaching the true doctrine, confuting gainsayers, rebuking sinners, and exhorting both the teachers and people under his care to conduct themselves properly in every respect.

The word "quick" means "living" (See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a> note); and the idea is, that he would be alike the judge of all who were alive when he should come, and of all who had died; see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>. In view of the fact that all, whether preachers or hearers, must give up their account to the final Judge, Paul charges Timothy to be faithful; and what is there which will more conduce to fidelity in the discharge of duty, than the thought that we must soon give up a solemn account of the manner in which we have performed it?<p>At his appearing - That is, the judgment shall then take place. This must refer to a judgment yet to take place, for the Lord Jesus has not yet "appeared" the second time to men; and, if this be so, then there is to be a resurrection of the dead. On the meaning of the word rendered "appearing," see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>. It is there rendered "brighteness"; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-14.htm">1 Timothy 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>.<p>And his kingdom - Or, at the setting up of his kingdom. The idea of his reigning, or setting up his kingdom, is not unfrequently associated with the idea of his cominG; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-28.htm">Matthew 16:28</a>. The meaning is, that, at his second advent, the extent and majesty of his kingdom will be fully displayed. It will be seen that he has control over the elements, over the graves of the dead, and over all the living. It will be seen that the earth and the heavens are under his sway, and that all things there acknowledge him as their sovereign Lord. In order to meet the full force of the language used by Paul here, it is not necessary to suppose that he will set up a visible kingdom on the earth, but only that there will be an illustrious display of himself as a king, and of the extent and majesty of the empire over which he presides: compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>2Ti 4:1-22.

Whose word the Scriptures are, and by whom they are inspired; who had made Timothy an able minister of the New Testament, and to whom he was accountable for his ministry: <p>and the Lord Jesus Christ; who is equal with God, and bestows ministerial gifts on men, and from whom Timothy had his; whose Gospel he preached; in whose cause he was embarked; and before whom he must appear, to give an account of his ministry, talents, and souls under his care: <p>who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; it is certain there will be a general judgment; the day is appointed, and Christ is ordained the Judge of all men; all judgment is committed to him, and he is ready to exercise it; for which he is abundantly qualified, being God omniscient and omnipotent; and which he will execute in the most righteous and impartial manner. The persons that will be judged by him are, "the quick and the dead"; by which are meant, not the different parts of men, their souls which are living and immortal, and their bodies which die and will be raised from the dead, though they will be judged in their whole persons; nor the different sorts of men, as good men, who are made alive by the Spirit and grace of God, and evil men, who are dead in trespasses and sins, and die in their sins; though this is a truth that God will judge both the righteous and the wicked: but rather by the "quick", are meant, such as will be found alive at Christ's coming; and by the "dead", such as having been dead, will be raised by him; and in short, the characters include all mentioned; who must all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. The time when this will be, is, <p>at his appearing, and his kingdom; which may be considered as an hendyadis, expressive of one and the same thing; and so the Syriac version renders it, "at the revelation of his kingdom"; or as two things, the one as antecedent and preparatory to the other; the former refers to the appearance of Christ at the last day. He appeared frequently to the Old Testament saints in an human form; and he really appeared in human nature in the fulness of time; and after his resurrection to his apostles and others, and even after his ascension to some; and he appears in a spiritual manner to believers in all ages; but to them that look for him, he will appear a second time in person, in a most glorious manner: for the present he is received up into heaven, where he is as it were hid, and is unseen to corporeal eyes; but in his due time he will be manifested in his own and his Father's glory, and in the glory of his angels; and this appearance will be greatly to the advantage of the saints, who will then appear in glory, and be like him, and see him as he is, and hence they look for it, and love it; and at this time will be the judgment, and then will the kingdom of Christ take place. Christ has a kingdom now, and ever had, which is not of this world, but is of a spiritual nature; and which will be more manifest in that latter day, by the spread of the Gospel, the numerous instances of conversion, and the revival of powerful religion and godliness, which we commonly call the spiritual reign of Christ; but the kingdom here designed, is the personal reign of Christ, for a thousand years: at the beginning of which will be the judgment of the saints, who having the crown of righteousness given them by the Judge, will reign with him as kings and priests; and at the end of this period will be the judgment of the wicked. The charge made before these two divine Persons, God and his Son Jesus Christ, follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> charge <i>thee</i> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</span><p>(1) The principal and chief of all admonitions, being therefore proposed with a most earnest charge, is this: that the word of God is explained and set forth with a certain holy urgent exhorting, as necessity requires: but in such a way that a good and true ground of the doctrine is laid, and the vehemency is tempered with all holy meekness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/2_timothy/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-1.htm" title="I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;...">2 Timothy 4:1-2</a>.

With the correct reading, <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐπιφ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. depends on <span class="greekheb">διαμαρτύρομαι</span> as the accusative of the oath (so, too, van Oosterzee and Plitt). It is, however, to be noted that in the N. T. <span class="greekheb">διαμαρτύρεσθαι</span> does not mean “swear” by itself, but only in connection with <span class="greekheb">ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (only in the Pastoral Epistles), and therefore only in this connection does it, like other verbs of swearing, govern the accusative, as Hofmann rightly remarks. Hence it follows that <span class="greekheb">καί</span> does not connect <span class="greekheb">ἐπιφάνειαν</span> with the previous <span class="greekheb">ἐνώπιον</span>, but belongs to the following <span class="greekheb">καί</span>: “both … and” (Hofmann). De Wette, appealing to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-26.htm" title="I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.">Deuteronomy 4:26</a>, incorrectly expounds it: “I call his appearance, etc., to witness;” present things may be summoned as witnesses, but not future events like the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιφάνεια</span> of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Vulg. has: per adventum, without <span class="greekheb">καί</span>: probably a translation of <span class="greekheb">κατά</span>, which is taken as <span class="greekheb">κατά</span> with the genitive, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπιφάνεια</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-14.htm" title="That you keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1 Timothy 6:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ</span>] Several expositors join the two expressions as an hendiadys (Bengel: <span class="greekheb">ἐπιφάνεια</span> est revelatio et exhortus regni) = <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐπιφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ</span>; but the <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐπιφ</span>. is against this. The two things are considered separately (Wiesinger: “the repetition of <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> is rhetorical; each element is intended to be taken independently, and considered in its full significance”); the <span class="greekheb">βασιλεία αὐτοῦ</span> is the regnum gloriae which begins with the return of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reason for adding these words lies in the <span class="greekheb">κρίνειν ζ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ν</span>.; Paul says he has Christ’s second coming and kingdom in his thoughts, that he may give greater importance to his exhortation.—<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-2.htm" title="Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.">2 Timothy 4:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">κήρυξον τὸν λόγον</span>] In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm" title="I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.">1 Timothy 5:21</a>, <span class="greekheb">διαμ</span>. is followed by <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> with the conjunctive; but here we have the simple imperative, which makes the appeal all the more urgent (Wiesinger).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον</span>, <span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>] This more precise definition is wanting here, because the emphasis lies chiefly on the verb, Paul indicating to Timothy the work to be done.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπίστηθι εὐκαίρως ἀκαίρως</span>] Most expositors join these words closely with <span class="greekheb">κήρυξον</span> in sense. Heydenreich: <span class="greekheb">ἐπίστηθι</span>, <span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">τῷ κηρύσσειν</span>. Theodoret: <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἁπλῶς καὶ ὡς ἔτυχεν αὐτὸν κηρύττειν παρεγγυᾷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ πάντα καιρὸν ἐπιτήδειον πρὸς τοῦτο νομίζειν</span>. Vulg.: “insta;” Luther: “persist;” so also van Oosterzee; similarly Wiesinger, who, in harmony with <span class="greekheb">ἐπίμενε αὐτοῖς</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-16.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, and to the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.">1 Timothy 4:16</a>, expounds it: “keep one’s attention or activity directed to a thing.” But this is not the usual meaning of the verb; it means rather “<span class="ital">step towards</span> or <span class="ital">draw near</span>” (Hofmann is less precise: “approach, appear”), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-8.htm" title="And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.">Luke 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-38.htm" title="And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.">Luke 2:38</a>, and other passages. The word is defined more precisely by <span class="greekheb">κήρυξον τὸν λόγον</span>: draw near with the preaching of the word. Who are the persons to whom Timothy is to draw near, may easily be supplied from the context, viz. to those to whom he has to preach the word. It is incorrect to think only of the whole church (Bretschneider: accede ad coetus christianos, so also de Wette), or only of the individual members (so before in this commentary). Plitt is correct: “draw near (to men), viz. with the word.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εὐκαίρως ἀκαίρως</span>[56]] Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΚΑΙΡῸΝ ἜΧΕ ὩΡΙΣΜΈΝΟΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΕῚ ΣΟῚ ΚΑΙΡῸς ἚΣΤΩ</span></span></span>.

Hofmann is wrong: “whether he comes seasonably or not to those whom he approaches with the word;” for there was no need to tell Timothy that the preacher was not bound to inquire into his hearers’ opinion and act accordingly. For the truth, the occasion is always seasonable. He who desires to wait until the occasion seem completely favourable for his work, will never find it. This is particularly true of the exercise of the evangelic office.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Note, finally, Beza’s remark: nempe quod ad carnis prudentiam pertinet; nam alioqui requiritur sanctae prudentiae spiritus, captans occasiones ad aedificationem opportunas.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΛΕΓΞΟΝ</span></span></span>] should be restricted neither to heresies nor to moral transgressions; it includes blame of everything blameworthy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΤΊΜΗΣΟΝ</span></span></span>] stronger than <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΛΕΓΞΟΝ</span></span></span>: “blame with decided manifestation of dislike;” often in the Gospels, also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-9.htm" title="And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelled in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.">Judges 1:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΑΚΆΛΕΣΟΝ</span></span></span>] Blame and exhortation should be joined in order to cause edification; blame by itself embitters, exhortation by itself is ineffectual.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΠΆΣῌ ΜΑΚΡΟΘΥΜΊᾼ ΚΑῚ ΔΙΔΑΧῇ</span></span></span>] An appendix to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΑΚΆΛΕΣΟΝ</span></span></span>, or, according to the reading of Tisch. 8, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΤΊΜΗΣΟΝ</span></span></span>, with which, however, it seems less appropriate.

Some take <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> as the object governed by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26</a>, "I call to witness...  Christ's epiphany and kingdom," taking <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in two senses or two constructions. Others take them as the accusatives of the things sworn by, "I charge thee before God and Jesus Christ, and by his epiphany and kingdom," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "by God;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, "by Jesus;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "by the Lord." But how awkward such a separation of the thing sworn by from the verb <span class="accented">is</span>, and how unnatural it is to couple with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> the two ideas, "before God" and "by Christ's epiphany," and how absolutely without example such a swearing by Christ's epiphany and kingdom is, nobody needs to be told. Others, as Huther, try to get over part at least of this awkwardness by taking the two <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>s as "both:" "by both his epiphany and his kingdom." Ellicott explains it by saying that as you could not put "the epiphany and the kingdom" in dependence upon <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (as if they were persons like <span class="accented">God</span> and <span class="accented">Christ</span>), they "naturally pass into the accusative." But surely this is all thoroughly unsatisfactory. The T.R. is perfectly easy and simple. <span class="accented">Appear</span>ing (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); ver. 8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-14.htm">1 Timothy 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>. <span class="accented">His kingdom.</span> So in the Nicene Creed: "He shall come again with glory to judge both the quick and the dead: whose kingdom shall have no end" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, followed by the judgment). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I charge (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a>.<p>At his appearing (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Rend.
