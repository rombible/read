In the whole Epistle there is not one note of fear—nothing which should lead us to suspect that the martyr Apostle was fearful for himself. It reads—does this last letter of the great Gentile teacher—in many places like a triumphant song of death. It, therefore, appears unnatural to introduce into the closing words of the Epistle the thought of the Lord’s help in the event of the Apostle’s losing heart. Far better is it to supply after “every evil work” the words “<span class= "ital">of the enemies,” </span>and to understand the deliverance which the Lord will accomplish for him, not as a deliverance from any shrinking or timidity unworthy of an apostle of the Lord, not even as a deliverance from the martyr-death, which he knew lay before him, <span class= "ital">but that through this very death, </span>the Lord Jesus would deliver him from all weariness and toil, and would bring him safe into His heavenly kingdom. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm" title="Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me.">Psalm 23:4</a>.)

He then bursts into an ascription of praise to that Lord Jesus Christ whom he had loved so long and so well, and who, in all his troubles and perplexities, had never left him friendless. For a similar ascription of glory to the Second Person of the ever blessed Trinity, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-21.htm" title="Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever.

It is dangerous having to do with those who would be enemies to such a man as Paul. The Christians at Rome were forward to meet him, Ac 28, but when there seemed to be a danger of suffering with him, then all forsook him. God might justly be angry with them, but he prays God to forgive them. The apostle was delivered out of the mouth of the lion, that is, of Nero, or some of his judges. If the Lord stands by us, he will strengthen us in difficulties and dangers, and his presence will more than supply every one's absence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work - He does not say from "death," for he expected now to die; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>.

From wicked and unreasonable men, and all their attempts upon him, and from all afflictions by them; not but that he expected afflictions as long as he was in the world, but he knew that God would support him under them; and in his own time and way deliver out of them; and at last entirely by death, when he should be no more attended with them; and from all the temptations of Satan, and his evil designs upon him, and from sin and iniquity; not that he expected to live free of Satan's temptations, or without sin, but he believed that he should be kept from sinking under the former, and from being under the dominion of the latter; and should not be left to deny his Lord, desert his cause, blaspheme his name, and apostatize from him: <p>and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom, the ultimate glory and happiness of the saints in heaven; so called, both because of its nature and place, and to distinguish it from the church, which is Christ's kingdom in this world, though it is not of it; and from his personal reign with his saints on earth, for the space of a thousand years; whereas this will be for ever: and unto this the apostle believed he should be preserved, as all the saints will be, notwithstanding the persecutions of the world, the temptations of Satan, and their own corruptions; for they are secured in an everlasting covenant, and in the hands of Christ; and have not only angels to encamp about them, and salvation, as walls and bulwarks to them, but God himself is a wall of fire around them, and they are kept by his power unto salvation: and besides, this heavenly kingdom is prepared for them, and given to them; they are chosen to be heirs and possessors of it; they are called unto it, and Christ is gone to receive it in their name, to prepare it for them, and will come again and introduce them into it: <p>to whom be glory for ever and ever, Amen: of the present deliverance, and of all others he had, or should receive, as well as of the provision of the heavenly kingdom for him, and of his preservation to it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the Lord shall deliver me from every <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> evil work, and will preserve <i>me</i> unto his <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> heavenly kingdom: to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever.

Amen.">2 Timothy 4:18</a>. In the assured confidence of faith, the apostle adds to <span class="greekheb">ἐῤῥύσθην</span> the word of hope: <span class="greekheb">ῥύσεταί με ὁ κύριος ἀπὸ πάντος ἔργου πονηροῦ</span>, for he knows that the Lord—even if it be through death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm" title="For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.">2 Timothy 4:6</a>)—will bring him into His kingdom. <span class="greekheb">ἔργον πονηρόν</span> is not equivalent to evil, as Luther translates it and Matthies explains it: “from every evil circumstance.” Taken in this sense, the thought would be quite irreconcilable with the apostle’s conviction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm" title="For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.">2 Timothy 4:6</a>. Besides, in the N. T. <span class="greekheb">πονηρόν</span> never refers to merely external affliction; it denotes rather what is morally evil. Still it cannot here mean the evil work which the apostle might do (Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">πᾶν ἁμάρτημα</span>; Grotius: liberabit me, ne quid agam Christiano, ne quid Apostolo indignum; de Wette: “from all evil work which I might do through want of stedfastness, through apostasy, and the like;” so, too, Beza, Heydenreich, and others). It must be interpreted of the wicked works of the enemies of the divine word; only with this view is the verb <span class="greekheb">ῥύσεται</span> appropriate, especially when combined with <span class="greekheb">σώσει</span> (Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, Hofmann). The apostle was still exposed to the attacks of the evil one, but he expresses the hope that the Lord would save him from them, so that they would do him no harm. Not, indeed, that he would not suffer the martyrdom he expected, but that through this he would come into the heavenly kingdom of the Lord, where there was prepared for him <span class="greekheb">στέφανος τῆς δικαιοσύνης</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm" title="From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.">2 Timothy 4:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ σώσει εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν αὑτοῦ τὴν ἐπουράνιον</span>] <span class="greekheb">σώσει εἰς</span> is a pregnant construction: he will save me and bring me into = <span class="greekheb">σώζων ἄξει μὲ εἰς</span> (Heydenreich).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The expression <span class="greekheb">ἡ βασιλεία ἡ ἐπουράνιος</span> does not occur elsewhere in the N. T.; but the idea is thoroughly apostolic and Pauline. For though Paul often calls Christ’s kingdom a future one, Christ is also present to him as <span class="greekheb">βασιλεὺς ἐν τοῖς ἐπουρανίοις</span>, whose <span class="greekheb">βασιλεία</span>, therefore, is also a present one.[72] The context points to this meaning here. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm" title="For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:">Php 1:23</a>, Paul expresses the longing to come to Christ <span class="ital">through death</span>; here he expresses the hope that the Lord would remove him into His kingdom <span class="greekheb">ἐκ παντὸς ἔργου πονηροῦ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As a suitable and natural utterance of awakened feeling, there follows a doxology which in this place cannot surprise us, though commonly his doxologies refer to God and not to Christ specially.[73]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[72] There is nothing to indicate that the apostle is here alluding to the heavenly kingdom of the Lord, “in contrast with the <span class="ital">earthly dominion of the present</span>” (Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[73] In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-27.htm" title="To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever.

Amen.">2 Timothy 4:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἔργου πονηροῦ</span>: The form of the clause may be modelled on the petition in the Lord’s Prayer, <span class="greekheb">ῥῦσαι ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ πονηροῦ</span>; but the addition of <span class="greekheb">ἔργου</span> proves that the deliverance spoken of is not from an external Evil Personality, but from a possible evil deed of the apostle’s own doing. The expression has always a subjective reference. See reff. This exegesis is in harmony with the view taken above of “the mouth of the lion”. Failure to be receptive of the strengthening grace of the Lord would have been, in St. Paul’s judgment, an “evil deed,” though others might easily find excuses for it. Chrys. takes a similar view of <span class="greekheb">ἔργου πονηροῦ</span>, but gives it a wider application: “He will yet again deliver me from every sin, that is, He will not suffer me to depart with condemnation”. This view is also supported by what follows, <span class="greekheb">σώσει</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. At one moment the apostle sees the crown of righteousness just within his grasp, at another, while no less confident, he acknowledges that he could not yet be said “to have apprehended”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σώσει εἰς</span>: <span class="ital">shall bring me safely to, salvum faciet</span> (Vulg.). “Dominus est et Liberator, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm" title="And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>, et Salvator, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Php 3:20</a>” (Bengel).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">βασιλείαν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐπουράνιον</span>: That the Father’s kingdom is also the Son’s is Pauline doctrine. <span class="greekheb">ἐπουράνιος</span> became a necessary addition to <span class="greekheb">βασιλεία</span> as it became increasingly evident that the kingdom of heaven which we see is very different from the kingdom of heaven to be consummated hereafter. It is difficult not to see a connexion between this passage and the doxology appended in primitive times to the Lord’s Prayer, <span class="greekheb">ὄτι σοῦ ἐστιν ἡ βασιλεία καὶ ἡ δύναμις καὶ ἡ δόξα εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ᾦ ἡ δόξα</span>: The doxology, unmistakably addressed to Christ, need only cause a difficulty to those who maintain that “God blessed for ever” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm" title="Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.

The Apostle for the last time ‘goes off abruptly’ at the word ‘deliver,’ and breaks into a final song of ‘faith, hope and love.’ The preposition after the verb is changed to suit the noun it goes with.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">every evil work</span>] Substantially the same in reference as above, ‘the mouth of the lion’; ‘Fightings and fears within, without.’ It has been thought that the Apostle had the Lord’s Prayer in his mind, giving faith’s application of the clause ‘deliver us from the evil’; and if so it is interesting to observe his interpretation, not ‘from the evil one,’ <span class="ital">masculine</span>, but ‘from the evil,’ <span class="ital">neuter</span>. The phrase ‘his heavenly kingdom’ which does not occur elsewhere, and the ascription of the ‘glory,’ may also be a reminiscence of the doxology; which must in that case have been already in use, as an addition to the prayer. And this is what we should expect from its occurrence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.

Interpreted by the Lord's Prayer, and by its own internal evidence, the meaning clearly is, "The Lord, who stood by me at my trial, will continue to be my Saviour. He will deliver me from every evil design of mine enemies, and from all the wiles and assaults of the devil, in short, from the whole power of evil, and will bring me safe into his own kingdom of light and righteousness." There is a strong contrast, as Bengel pithily observes, between "the evil work" and "his heavenly kingdom." A triumphant martyrdom is as true a deliverance as escape from death. Compare our Lord's promise, "There shall not an hair of your head perish" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-18.htm">Luke 21:18</a> compared with ver. 16). St. Paul's confidence simply is that the Lord would, in his own good time and way, transfer him from this present evil world, and from the powers of darkness, into his eternal kingdom of light and righteousness. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Every evil work (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Every design and attempt against him and his work. &#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; evil cannot be limited to evil on its active side. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a>. The word is connected at the root with &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to be needy, and &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; to toil; and this connection opens a glimpse of that sentiment which associated badness with a poor and toiling condition. The word means originally full of or oppressed by labors; thence, that which brings annoyance or toil.
