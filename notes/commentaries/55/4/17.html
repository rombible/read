The strength and courage which the <span class= "ital">felt</span> presence of his Lord gave him, enabled him on that occasion, when alone, friendless, accused of a hateful crime before the highest earthly tribunal in the capital city of the world, to plead not only for himself but for that great cause with which he was identified. He spoke possibly for the last time publicly [we know nothing of the final trial, when he was condemned] the glad tidings of which he was the chosen herald to the Gentile world. It is probable that this great trial took place in the Forum, in one of the Pauline Basilicas—so called after L. Æmilius Paulus. It is certain it was in the presence of a crowded audience. St. Paul evidently intimates this when he tells us how he spoke “that all the Gentiles might hear.” This was apparently the culminating point of St. Paul’s labours—the last stone of the laborious edifice of his life’s work. Had the courage of the Apostle of the Gentiles failed him on this most momentous occasion, the spirit of the sorely-tried Church of Rome had surely sunk, and that marvellous and rapid progress of the gospel in the West—which, in a little more than a hundred years, would make its influence felt in well-nigh every city and village of the empire—had been arrested.<p><span class= "bld">And that all the Gentiles might hear.</span>—Here alluding primarily to the crowded audience which had listened on this solemn occasion to St. Paul’s <span class= "ital">Apologia pro Christo; </span>but there is another and deeper reference to those uncounted peoples in the isles of the Gentiles, who, by St. Paul’s work and words, would come to the saving knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus.<p><span class= "bld">And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span>—Expositors have, in all ages, dwelt much on the question, “Who was to be understood under the figure of the lion?” The fathers mostly believe the Emperor Nero was here alluded to. Others have suggested that St. Paul was referring to the “lions” of the amphitheatre, from whom, at all events for the time, he had been delivered. It is, however, best to understand the expression as a figurative expression for extreme danger. His Master on that dread occasion stood by him, and gave him strength and wisdom over man to speak the words of life, and delivered him for the moment out of the imminent peril threatening him, allowing him, not only to speak his Master’s words there, but also thus to write this solemn farewell charge to Timothy and the Church. That such figurative language was not unusual, compare the <span class= "ital">Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans, </span>iii.:8, in which writing the prisoner describes his journey from Syria to Rome as one long “fight with wild beasts,” and speaks of himself as “bound to ten leopards,” thus designating his soldier guards.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_timothy/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-17.htm" title="Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion....">2 Timothy 4:17-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Notwithstanding </span>— I was not left entirely destitute; for, though men forsook me, <span class="ital">the Lord stood with me </span>— According to his promise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-15.htm" title="For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.">Luke 21:15</a>; <span class="ital">and strengthened me </span>— With that inward fortitude of mind which no human support could have inspired; <span class="ital">that by me the preaching — </span>The gospel which we preach; <span class="ital">might be fully known </span>— <span class="greekheb">Πληροφορηθη</span>, literally, <span class="ital">might be carried with a full sail; </span>that is, fully and boldly declared.

It is dangerous having to do with those who would be enemies to such a man as Paul. The Christians at Rome were forward to meet him, Ac 28, but when there seemed to be a danger of suffering with him, then all forsook him. God might justly be angry with them, but he prays God to forgive them. The apostle was delivered out of the mouth of the lion, that is, of Nero, or some of his judges. If the Lord stands by us, he will strengthen us in difficulties and dangers, and his presence will more than supply every one's absence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me - Though all "men" forsook me, yet "God" did not. This expresses a universal truth in regard to the faithfulness of God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-10.htm">Psalm 27:10</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17-19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1-2</a>.<p>That by me the preaching might be fully known - The word "preaching," here probably means "the gospel as preached by him." The word rendered "might be fully known" - &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#837;  ple&#772;rophore&#772;&#772;the&#772; - means "might obtain full credence;" that is, might be fully confirmed, so that others might be assured of its truth. The apostle doubtless means that on his trial, though forsaken by all men, he was enabled to be so steadfast in his profession of the truth, and so calm in the prospect of death, that all who witnessed his trial saw that there was a reality in religion, and that the gospel was founded in truth. He had maintained as a preacher that the gospel was able to support the soul in trial, and he was now able to illustrate its power in his own case. He had proclaimed the gospel as the true system of religion, and he was now able to bear testimony to it with the prospect of approaching martyrdom.<p>The sentiment of this passage then is, that the truth of the gospel is made known, or that men may become fully assured of it, by the testimony which is borne to it by its friends in the near prospect of death. One of the most important means of establishing the truth of the gospel in the world has been the testimony borne to it by martyrs, and the spirit of unwavering confidence in God which they have evinced. And now, one of the most important methods of keeping up the knowledge of the value of religion in the world, and of convincing men of the truth of Christianity, is the spirit evinced by its friends when they are about to die. Men judge much, and justly, of the value of a system of religion by its power to comfort in the day of calamity, and to sustain the soul when about to enter on an untried state of being. That system is of little value to mankind which leaves us in the day of trial; that is of inestimable worth which will enable us to die with the firm hope of a brighter and better world. A Christian, having served his God faithfully in life, may, therefore, be eminently useful when he comes to die.<p>And that all the Gentiles might hear - Paul was at this time in Rome. His trial was before a pagan tribunal, and he was surrounded by Pagans. Rome, too, was then the center of the world, and at all times there was a great conflux of strangers there. His trial, therefore, gave him an opportunity of testifying to the truth of Christianity before Gentile rulers, and in such circumstances that the knowledge of his sufferings, and of the religion for which he suffered, might be conveyed by the strangers who witnessed it to the ends of the world. His main object in life was to make the gospel known to the Gentiles, and he had thus an opportunity of furthering that great cause, even on what he supposed might be the trial which would determine with him the question of life or death; compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-10.htm">Romans 1:10</a>.<p>And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion - This may either mean that he was delivered from Nero, compared with a lion, or literally that he was saved from being thrown to lions in the amphitheater, as was common in Rome; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>.<p>It is not uncommon in the Scriptures to compare tyrants and persecutors with ravenous wild beasts; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-30.htm">Jeremiah 2:30</a>. Nero is called a "lion" by Seneca, and it was usual among pagan writers to apply the term in various senses to princes and warriors; see Grotius, in loc. The common interpretation here has been, that this refers to Nero, and there is no improbability in the interpretation. Still, it is quite as natural to suppose that the punishment which had been appointed for him, or to which he would have been subjected, was to be thrown to lions, and that in some way, now unknown to us, he had been delivered from it. Paul attributes his deliverance entirely to the Lord - but what instrumental agency there may have been, he does not specify. It seems probable that it was his own defense; that he was enabled to plead his own cause with so much ability that he found favor even with the Roman emperor, and was discharged. If it had been through the help of a friend at court, it is hardly to be supposed that he would not have mentioned the name of him to whom he owed his deliverance. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. the Lord&#8212;the more because men deserted me.<p>stood with me&#8212;stronger than "came forward with me" (Greek, 2Ti 4:16).<p>strengthened&#8212;Greek, "put strength in me."<p>by me&#8212;"through me"; through my means.

So Tiberius is called by Marsyas, Agrippa's freeman, when he brought the news of his death to his master (g); and Ahasuerus by Esther (h); and Nero himself is called a civil beast by Apollonius Tyanaeus (i); though some think that not Nero, but Helius, whom he had appointed governor in his room, he being at this time in Greece, is here meant, before whom Paul was tried, and out of whose hands he was delivered. <p>(g) Joseph.

It is still more impossible to suppose that literal wild beasts are meant. Paul’s Roman citizenship secured him from that degradation. The Greek commentators take “the lion” to mean Nero, “from his ferocity” (Chrys.). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Esth. 14:13, of Ahasuerus; Joseph. <span class="ital">Antiq</span>. xviii. 6, 10, of Tiberius.

But, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, it acquires the meaning of standing by for the purpose of helping. The contrast between the timid faithless friends who failed him like a deceitful brook (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a>), and the faithfulness of the Lord who was a very present Help in trouble, is very striking. Strengthened me (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>, note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-8.htm">Acts 6:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The message</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The A.V. <span class="accented">preaching</span> is far better. St. Paul means that gospel which he was commissioned to preach, and which he did preach openly in full court when he was on his trial (see ver. 15, note). <span class="cmt_word">Might be fully proclaimed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, note; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>. <span class="cmt_word">All the Gentiles might hear</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-12.htm">Philippians 1:12-14</a>). The brave, unselfish spirit of the apostle thinking more of the proclamation of the gospel than of his own life, is truly admirable. <span class="cmt_word">I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span> Surely there can be no doubt that, as Bengel says, this is a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20, 21</a>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "I was delivered," comes from the twentieth verse, "Deliver my soul from the sword," and the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is found <span class="accented">verbatim</span> in ver. 21. The apostle means his deliverance from the executioner's sword. In the next verse we find both the words <span class="greek">&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and the whole tone of the psalm breathes the same spirit as the saying, "The Lord stood by me." Dean Alford's suggestion that the lion here is Satan, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, and the danger which the apostle escaped was not death, which he did not fear, but betraying the gospel under the fear of death, is ingenious, but rather far fetched, though not impossible. It may possibly have been part of what was in St. Paul's mind. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/2_timothy/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Strengthened (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>.<p>The preaching (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;)<p>Better, the message (par excellence), the gospel message.
