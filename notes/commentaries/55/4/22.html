It is the best prayer we can offer for our friends, that the Lord Jesus Christ may be with their spirits, to sanctify and save them, and at last to receive them to himself. Many who believed as Paul, are now before the throne, giving glory to their Lord: may we be followers of them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit; - see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-18.htm">Galatians 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm">Romans 15:20</a>. The subscription to this Epistle was not added by Paul himself, nor is there any evidence that it was by an inspired man, and it is of no authority. There is not the slightest evidence that Timothy was "ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians," or that he was a "bishop" there at all. There is no reason to believe that he was even a "pastor" there, in the technical sense; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>.

To counsel and advise in every difficult matter; to comfort under every distress; to supply with all grace in every time of need; and to strengthen and fit for every part and branch of duty. <p>Grace be with you, Amen: which is the apostle's common salutation in all epistles. The Syriac version renders it, "grace be with thee"; but the Greek copies read in the plural, "with you"; which shows that the epistle was designed for the use of the whole church, as well as of Timothy. The subscription follows, which is not in many ancient copies, and is not to be depended on. <p>The second epistle unto Timotheus; so far is right; this is certainly the second epistle to Timothy: <p>ordained the first bishop of the church of the Ephesians: this is omitted in the Syriac version; nor is it likely, much less certain, that he ever was bishop of Ephesus, or ordained as a bishop of any place, but was rather an evangelist, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, <p>was written from Rome: this is evident from his being a prisoner when he wrote it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8</a>. And yet in the Alexandrian copy it is said to be written from Laodicea: <p>when Paul was brought before Nero the second time; but whether he was before Nero at all is a question, or only before a Roman governor or judge. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_timothy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.

Observe how often this one brief name of his Saviour and Master has fallen from his pen in these closing paragraphs, taking the place of the full special title Christ Jesus (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;">1 Timothy 1:1</a>) used through the Pastorals; five times in the last fifteen verses, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-8.htm" title="From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.">2 Timothy 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2 Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-17.htm" title="Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion....">2 Timothy 4:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-22.htm" title="The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

But its statements are in this case more nearly correct. See, as to Timothy’s charge at Ephesus, Introduction, p. 66.

The R.T. omits the "amen" at the end, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-21.htm">1 Timothy 6:21</a>. Thus doses our last authentic account of this great apostle; these are, perhaps, the last words of him who wrought a greater change in the condition of mankind by his speech than any man that ever lived.
