Christ is called God’s <span class="ital">only-begotten Son, </span>to distinguish him from all others, who in Scripture are called <span class="ital">the sons of God; </span>and to heighten our idea of God’s love to us, in giving a person of such dignity, and so beloved of God, to die for us. It is supposed, that by giving Christ the title of <span class="ital">God’s only-begotten Son </span>in this passage, the apostle intended to overturn the error of Ebion and Cerinthus, who affirmed that Christ was not God’s Son by nature, but that, like other good men, he was honoured with the title of God’s Son on account of his virtues; in which opinion these heresiarchs have been followed by some in modern times. They, however, who hold this opinion ought to show a reason why the epithet of <span class="ital">the only begotten </span>is appropriated to Christ.” <span class="ital">That we might live through him </span>— That the sentence of condemnation to the second death, to which we were obnoxious, might be reversed, and that being justified by living faith, and regenerated by the quickening Spirit of God, we might live a spiritual life in the divine favour, and in union with Christ here, and might be conducted to eternal life hereafter.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:7-13 The Spirit of God is the Spirit of love. He that does not love the image of God in his people, has no saving knowledge of God. For it is God's nature to be kind, and to give happiness. The law of God is love; and all would have been perfectly happy, had all obeyed it. The provision of the gospel, for the forgiveness of sin, and the salvation of sinners, consistently with God's glory and justice, shows that God is love. Mystery and darkness rest upon many things yet. God has so shown himself to be love, that we cannot come short of eternal happiness, unless through unbelief and impenitence, although strict justice would condemn us to hopeless misery, because we break our Creator's laws. None of our words or thoughts can do justice to the free, astonishing love of a holy God towards sinners, who could not profit or harm him, whom he might justly crush in a moment, and whose deserving of his vengeance was shown in the method by which they were saved, though he could by his almighty Word have created other worlds, with more perfect beings, if he had seen fit. Search we the whole universe for love in its most glorious displays? It is to be found in the person and the cross of Christ. Does love exist between God and sinners? Here was the origin, not that we loved God, but that he freely loved us. His love could not be designed to be fruitless upon us, and when its proper end and issue are gained and produced, it may be said to be perfected. So faith is perfected by its works. Thus it will appear that God dwells in us by his new-creating Spirit. A loving Christian is a perfect Christian; set him to any good duty, and he is perfect to it, he is expert at it. Love oils the wheels of his affections, and sets him on that which is helpful to his brethren. A man that goes about a business with ill will, always does it badly. That God dwells in us and we in him, were words too high for mortals to use, had not God put them before us. But how may it be known whether the testimony to this does proceed from the Holy Ghost? Those who are truly persuaded that they are the sons of God, cannot but call him Abba, Father. From love to him, they hate sin, and whatever disagrees with his will, and they have a sound and hearty desire to do his will. Such testimony is the testimony of the Holy Ghost.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In this was manifested the love of God - That is, in an eminent manner, or this was a most signal proof of it.

The love of God here spoken of, and instanced in, is not his general love to all his creatures, which is shown in the make of them, and in the support of them in their beings, and in his providential care of them, and kindness to them; but his special love towards his elect, and which was before it was manifested; it was secretly in his heart from everlasting, and did not begin to be at the mission of Christ into the world, but was then in a most glaring manner manifested: there were several acts of it before, as the choice of them in Christ, the appointment of him to be their Saviour, and the covenant of grace made with him on their account; these were more secret and hidden; but now the love and kindness of God appeared, broke forth, and shone out in its glory; this is a most flagrant and notorious instance of it, in which it is exceedingly conspicuous; this is a most clear proof, a plain and full demonstration of it: <p>because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world; the sender is God the Father, who is distinguished from the Son that is sent; of which act of sending; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a> and See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>; and for him, who is that God against whom we have sinned, and is that lawgiver that is able to save, and to destroy, and of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, to send his Son to be the Saviour of sinful men is an amazing instance of love; and which appears the more manifest, when it is observed that it is "his only begotten Son" that is sent; of which See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; and the place he was sent into is the world, where his people are, and where their sins are committed, he came to expiate; and where he was treated with great indignity and contempt, and suffered many things, and at last death itself: the end of his mission was, <p>that we might live through him; who were dead in Adam, dead in sin, and dead in law, and could not quicken themselves; nor obtain eternal life for themselves, by their performances. Christ came, being sent, that they might have life, and that more abundantly than Adam had in innocence, or man lost by the fall; and accordingly they were quickened together with him; when he was quickened, after he had been put to death, they were virtually and representatively quickened and justified in him; and in consequence of his death and resurrection from the dead, they are regenerated and made spiritually alive, and live unto righteousness; and through his righteousness wrought out for them, and imputed to them, they are in a legal sense alive unto God, and alive and comfortable in their own souls, living by faith on Christ, and have a right and title to eternal life; and which they also have through him, and which is chiefly intended here; for the design is not only that they may live spiritually and comfortably here, but eternally hereafter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_john/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm" title="In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.">1 John 4:9</a>.

With the first interpretation the sentence: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν κόσμον</span>, makes a difficulty which has been overlooked by the commentators;[263] with regard to the second, the article <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ</span></span></span> is wanting before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἩΜῖΝ</span></span></span>; but a direct connection of an attributive clause with a substantive, without a connecting article, is very often found in the N. T., and is therefore not “ungrammatical” (as Düsterdieck thinks); the idea is here, then, the same as that which John in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-16.htm" title="And we have known and believed the love that God has to us.

It is especially in its purpose that the sending of His Son is the manifestation of God’s love to us. The more particular description of the Son of God as <span class="greekheb">ὁ μονογενής</span>, which is frequently found in the Gospel of John, appears only here in his Epistles. In Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-12.htm" title="Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.">Luke 7:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-42.htm" title="For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying.

So the expression is used by John also to denote Christ as the <span class="ital">only</span> Son of God, “besides whom His Father has none.” This predicate is suitable to Him, inasmuch as He is the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> who is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἈΡΧῇ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΠΡῸς ΤῸΝ ΘΕΌΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΘΕΌς</span></span></span>.

Meyer on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>. Calvin rightly remarks: “quod unigenitum appellat, ad auxesin valet.” How great the love of God, in that He sent His only-begotten Son in order that we might live! Baumgarten-Crusius: “<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΟΝΟΓΕΝΉς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΉΣΟΜΕΝ</span></span></span> are the principal words: the most glorious … for our salvation!”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[263] Even Ebrard has not perceived the difficulty. It lies in this, that by <span class="greekheb">ὅτι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. something is mentioned which happened for us, but not which happened <span class="ital">to</span> us; differently in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a>. Brückner thinks that the difficulty is removed by the fact that “in the purpose of the sending of Christ there also lies something which happened <span class="ital">to</span> us;” incorrectly, since even if the purpose of that is <span class="ital">our</span> life (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα ζήσωμεν</span>), yet it cannot be said that the love shown in the sending of Christ has manifested itself to us; the result is then that <span class="greekheb">ἑφανερώθη</span> is taken = “has operated,” and that an emphasis is laid on <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμῖν</span> which it does not receive from the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[264] Lücke incorrectly observes that with this connection there is in <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμῖν</span> “something superfluous and unsuitable.” This is so far from being the case, that it is just in this that the apostle arrives at the consideration of the relationship between God and the believer. True, the love of God relates to the <span class="ital">whole</span> world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἠγάπησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν κόσμον</span>, and to all, without exception, He has given, by sending His Son, the possibility of not being lost, but obtaining eternal life, but the loving purpose of God is accomplished only in them that believe; the unbelieving remain <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὀργῇ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>; hence the love of God to the world is more narrowly limited than His love to believers, who are His <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm" title="In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.">1 John 4:9</a>.

John; it occurs four times in the Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-18.htm" title="He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.">John 3:18</a>) and here. ‘Only-born’ would be a more accurate rendering: Christ is the only <span class="ital">born</span> Son as distinct from the many who have <span class="ital">become</span> sons. The word occurs in LXX. to translate a Hebrew word (<span class="ital">yachid</span>), which is elsewhere rendered ‘beloved’ or ‘darling’ (<span class="greekheb">ἀγαπητός</span>): and oddly enough where the Greek has ‘only’ the A.

Beware of the inadequate and misleading rendering "towards us" for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. It means <span class="cmt_word">in us</span>, and belongs to "manifested," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a> plainly shows. We must not connect together "the love of God in us," still less "the love of God toward us," as one idea. "In us" means "in our case," and the whole may be paraphrased: "A transcendent manifestation of the love of God has been made in regard to us, in that he hath sent," etc. The verse might serve as a summary of St. John's Gospel. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> as applied to Christ is peculiar to St. John; it and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> are the key-words of the passage.
