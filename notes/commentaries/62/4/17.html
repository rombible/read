Profundity is often supposed to be obscurity, but the deepest depth is clear. John, in his gospel and epistles, deals with the deepest realities, and with all things in their eternal aspects, but his vocabulary is the simplest in the New Testament. God and the world, life and death, love and hate, light and darkness, these are the favourite words round which his thoughts gather. Here are nine little monosyllables. What can be simpler than, ‘As He is, so are we in this world?’ And what can go beyond the thought that lies in it, that a Christian is a living likeness of Christ?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the connection of my text is quite as striking as its substance. John has been dwelling upon his favourite thought that to abide in love is to abide in God, and God in us. And then he goes on to say that ‘Herein’--that is, in such mutual abiding in love--’is love made perfect with us’; and the perfection of that love, which is thus communion, is in order that, at the great solemn day of future trial, men may lift up their faces and meet His glance--which is not strange to them, nor met for the first time--with open-hearted and open-countenanced ‘boldness.’ But ‘love’ and ‘abiding’ are the source of confidence in the Day of Judgment, because love and abiding are the source of assimilation to Christ’s life. We have boldness, ‘because as He is, so are we in this world’; and we are as He is, because we love and abide in Him. So here are three thoughts, the assimilation of the Christian man to Christ; the frank confidence which it begets; and the process by which it is secured.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. A Christian is Christ’s living likeness.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That is a startling thing to say, and all the more startling if you notice that John does not say ‘As He was,’ in this earthly life of humiliation and filial obedience, but ‘as He is,’ in His heavenly life and reign and glory. That might well repel us from all thought of possible resemblance, but the light, however brilliant it may be, is not blinding, and it is the Christ as He is, and not only--true as that is--the Christ as He was, who is the original of which Christian men are copies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now there is the difference between the teaching of such classes of religionists as represent Christ’s humanity as all in all, and preach to us that He, in His earthly life is the pattern to whom we are to seek to conform our lives, and the true evangelical teaching. That dead Man is living, and His present life has in it elements which we can grasp, and to which every Christian life is to be conformed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Is there anything, then, within the glory to which I, in my poor, struggling, hampered, imperfect life here on earth, can feel that my character is being shaped? Yes, surely there is. I have no doubt that, in the words of my text, the Apostle is remembering the solemn ones of our Lord’s high-priestly prayer as recorded in the seventeenth chapter of his gospel, where the same antithesis of our being in the world, and His not being there, recurs; and where the analogy and resemblance are distinctly stated--’I in Thee, and Thou in Me, that they also may be in us.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So, then, when we stand with our letter-writer in his Patmos island, and see the countenance ‘as the sun shining in his strength, and the eyes as a flame of fire,’ and the many crowns upon the head, and the many stars in the hand, though we may feel as if all resemblance was at an end, and aspiration after likeness could only fall at His feet and cover its face, yet there is within the glory something which may be repeated and reproduced in our lives, and that is, the indissoluble union of a Son with a Father, in all loving obedience, in all perfect harmony, in all mutual affection and outgoing of heart and thoughts. This is the centre of the life, alike of the Christ when He is glorified, and of the Christ when He was upon earth. So the very secret heart of the mysterious being of the Son is to be, and necessarily is, repeated in all those who in Him have received the adoption of sons.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Or to put the whole thing into plainer words, it is the religious and the moral aspects of Christ’s being, and not any one particular detail thereof; and these, as they live and reign on the Throne, just as truly as these, as they suffered and wept upon earth--it is these to which it is our destiny to be conformed. We are like Him, if we are His, in this,--that we are joined to God, that we hold fellowship with Him, that our lives are all permeated with the divine, that we are saturated with the presence of God, that we have submitted ourselves to Him and to His will, that ‘not my will, but Thine, be done’ is the very inmost meaning of our hearts and our lives. And thus ‘we,’ even here, ‘bear the image of the heavenly, as we have borne the images of the earthly.’ Now I am not going to dwell upon details; all these can be filled in by each of us for himself. The centre-point which I insist upon is this--the filial union with God, the filial submission to Him, and the consequent purity as Christ is pure, righteousness as Christ is righteous, and walking even as Christ walked, for ever in the light.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But then there is another point that I desire to refer to. I have put an emphasis upon the ‘is’ instead of the ‘was,’ as it applies to Jesus Christ. I would further put an emphasis upon the ‘are,’ as it applies to us--’So are we.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>John is not exhorting, he is affirming. He is not saying what Christian men ought to strive to be, but he is saying what all Christian men, by virtue of their Christian character, are. Or, to put it into other words, likeness to the Master is certain. It is inevitably involved in the relation which a Christian man bears to the Lord. There may be degrees in the likeness, there may be differences of skill and earnestness in the artist. We have to labour like a portrait painter, slowly and tentatively approaching to the complete resemblance. It is ‘a life-long task ere the lump be leavened.’ This likeness does not reach its completeness by a leap. It is not struck, as the image of a king is, upon the blank metal disc, by one stroke, but it is wrought out by long, laborious, and, as I said, approximating and tentative touches. My text suggests that to us by its addition, ‘So are we, in this world.’ The ‘world’--or, to use modern phraseology, ‘the environment’--conditions the resemblance. As far as it is possible for a thing encompassed with dust and ashes to resemble the radiant sun in the heavens, so far is the resemblance carried here. Some measure of it, and a growing measure, is inseparable from the reality of a Christian life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, you Christian people, does that plain statement touch you anywhere? ‘So are we.’ Well! you would be quite easy if John had said: ‘So may we be; so should we be; so shall we be.’ But what about the ‘so are we’? What a ghastly contradiction the lives of multitudes of professing Christians are to that plain statement! ‘Like Jesus Christ’--would anybody say that about anything in me? ‘So are we’--no words of mine, dear brethren, can make the statement more searching, more impressive; but, I pray you, lay this to heart: ‘If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.’ You may take sacraments and profess Christianity, or, as we Nonconformists have it, ‘join churches,’ and do all manner of outward work for ever and a day; but if you have not the likeness of Christ, at least in germ, and growing to something more than a germ, in your characters, you had better revise your position, and ask whether, after all, you have not been walking in a vain show, and fancied yourselves the servants of Christ, while you bear the image of Christ’s enemy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A very tiny gully on a hillside, made by showers of rain, may fall into the same slopes, and has been created by the very same forces, working according to the same laws, as have scooped out valleys miles broad, bordered by mountains thousands of feet high. And in my little life, poor as it is, limited as it is, environed as it is by the world, and therefore often hampered and stained, as well as helped and brightened, by its environment, there may be, and there will be, in some degree, if I am a Christian man, the very same power at work by which Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father shines as the sun on the throne of the universe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But then, notice further, how that limitation to which I have referred in this world carries with it another message. There is Christ in the heavens, veiled and unseen. Here are you on earth, his representative. There is a rage at present for putting pictures into all books, and folk will scarcely read unless they get illustrated literature. The world has for its illustrations of the gospel the lives of us Christian people. In the book there are principles and facts, and readers should be able to turn the page and see all pictured in us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That is what you are set to do in this world. ‘As the Father sent Me, even so send I you.’ ‘As He is, so are we in this world.’ It may be our antagonist, but it is our sphere, and its presence is necessary to evoke our characters. Christ has entrusted His reputation, His honour, to us, and many a man that never cares to look at Him as He is revealed in Scripture, would be wooed and won to look at Him and love Him, if we Christian people were more true to our vocation, and bore more conspicuously on our faces and in our characters the image of the heavenly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Look for a moment at the second thought that is here: such a likeness to Jesus Christ is the only thing that will enable a man to lift up his head in the Day of Judgment.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘We have boldness,’ says John, because ‘as He is, so are we.’ Now that is a very strong statement of a truth that popular, evangelical theology has far too much obscured. People talk about being, at the last, ‘accepted in the beloved.’ God be thanked, it is true. A sweet old hymn that a great many of us learned when we were children, though it is not so well known in these days, says:--<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Bold shall I stand in that great day,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> For who aught to my charge shall lay,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> While through Thy blood absolved I am<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> From sin’s tremendous curse and shame?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I believe that, and I try to preach it. But do not let us forget the other side. My text is in full accordance with the principles of our Lord’s own teaching; and who knows the principles of His own words so well as the judge, who tells us, in His pictures of that great day, that the question put to every man will be, not what you believe, but what did you do, and what are you?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But this truth of my text has been not only wounded in the house of the friends of Christianity, but it has been overlooked by one of the very frequent objections that we hear made to evangelical teaching, that, according to it, a man is judged according to his belief and not according to his deeds. A man is judged according to his--not belief--but according to his faith. But he is judged according also to--not his work--but according to his character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And I wish, dear friends, to lay this upon your hearts, because many of us are too apt to forget it, that whilst unquestionably the beginning of salvation, and the condition of forgiveness here, and of acceptance hereafter, are laid in trust in Jesus Christ, that trust is sure to work out a character which is in conformity with His requirements and moulded after the likeness of Himself. ‘The judgment of God is according to truth,’ and what a man is determines where a man shall be, and what he shall receive through all eternity. Remember Christ’s own teaching. Remember the teaching of that other apostle than John, according to which the ‘wood, hay, stubble,’ built by a man upon the foundation shall be burned up, and the builder himself be saved, yet so as by fire. And lay this to heart, that it is only when faith works in us, through love and communion, characters like Jesus Christ’s, that we shall be able to stand--though even then we shall have to trust to divine and infinite mercy, and to the sprinkling of His blood--before the Throne of God. Lay up in store for yourselves a good foundation unto eternal life. And take this as the preaching of my text; character, and character alone, will stand the judgment of that great day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no real antagonism between such truths and the widest preaching of salvation by faith. It is the same man who, in his gospel, says, as from the lips of the Lord Himself, ‘He that believeth is not judged,’ and in his letter says, ‘We may have boldness in that day, because, as He is, so are we in this world.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. One word about the last point; the process by which this likeness is secured.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That is contained, as I tried to show in my introductory remarks, in the earlier part of the verse. Our love is made perfect by dwelling in God, and God in us; in order that we may be thus conformed to Christ’s likeness, and so have boldness in that great day. To be like Jesus Christ, what is needed is that we love Him, and that we keep in touch with Him. What is it to ‘abide’ in Him?--to direct the continual flow of mind and love and will and practical obedience to Him, to bear Him ever in the secret place of my heart whilst my hands are occupied with daily business, and my feet are running the sometimes rough race that is set before me. Think of Him ever, love Him ever. Let His name be like a perfume breathed through the whole atmosphere of your lives. Keep your wills in the attitude of submission, of acceptance, of indecision when necessary, and of absolute dependence upon Him. Let your outward acts be such as shall not bring a film of separation between Him and you. When thus our whole being is steeped and drenched with Christ, then it cannot but be that we shall be like Him. Even ‘clouds themselves as suns appear, when the sun pierces them with light.’ ‘Abide in Me, and I in you.’ You cannot make yourselves like Christ, but you can fasten yourselves to Christ, and He will give you power which shall make you like Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, remember, such abiding is no idle waiting, no passive confidence. It is full of energy, full of suppression, when necessary, of what is contrary to your truest self, and full of strenuous cultivation of that which is in accord with the will of the Father, and with the likeness of the ‘first-born among many brethren.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dear friends, lie in the light and you will become light. Abide in Christ, and you will get like Christ; and, being like Him, you will be able to lift up your heads, and rejoice when you front Him on the Throne, and you are at the bar. Then, when you are no more in the world, the likeness will be perfected, because the communion is complete. ‘We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.’<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:14-21 The Father sent the Son, he willed his coming into this world. The apostle attests this. And whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. This confession includes faith in the heart as the foundation; makes acknowledgment with the mouth to the glory of God and Christ, and profession in the life and conduct, against the flatteries and frowns of the world. There must be a day of universal judgment. Happy those who shall have holy boldness before the Judge at that day; knowing he is their Friend and Advocate! Happy those who have holy boldness in the prospect of that day, who look and wait for it, and for the Judge's appearance! True love to God assures believers of God's love to them. Love teaches us to suffer for him and with him; therefore we may trust that we shall also be glorified with him, 2Ti 2:12. We must distinguish between the fear of God and being afraid of him; the fear of God imports high regard and veneration for God. Obedience and good works, done from the principle of love, are not like the servile toil of one who unwillingly labours from dread of a master's anger. They are like that of a dutiful child, who does services to a beloved father, which benefit his brethren, and are done willingly. It is a sign that our love is far from perfect, when our doubts, fears, and apprehensions of God, are many. Let heaven and earth stand amazed at his love. He sent his word to invite sinners to partake of this great salvation. Let them take the comfort of the happy change wrought in them, while they give him the glory. The love of God in Christ, in the hearts of Christians from the Spirit of adoption, is the great proof of conversion. This must be tried by its effects on their temper, and their conduct to their brethren. If a man professes to love God, and yet indulges anger or revenge, or shows a selfish disposition, he gives his profession the lie. But if it is plain that our natural enmity is changed into affection and gratitude, let us bless the name of our God for this seal and earnest of eternal happiness. Then we differ from the false professors, who pretend to love God, whom they have not seen, yet hate their brethren, whom they have seen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Herein is our love made perfect - Margin, "love with us." The margin accords with the Greek - &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;  &#787; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  meth' he&#772;mo&#772;n. The meaning is, "the love that is within us, or in us, is made perfect." The expression is unusual; but the general idea is, that love is rendered complete or entire in the manner in which the apostle specifies. In this way love becomes what it should be, and will prepare us to appear with confidence before the judgment-seat.

(Compare 1Jo 3:19-21.)<p>our love&#8212;rather as the Greek, "LOVE (in the abstract, the principle of love [Alford]) is made perfect (in its relations) with us." Love dwelling in us advances to its consummation "with us" that is, as it is concerned with us: so Greek. Lu 1:58, "showed mercy upon (literally, 'with') her": 2Jo 2, the truth "shall be with us for ever."<p>boldness&#8212;"confidence": the same Greek as 1Jo 3:21, to which this passage is parallel. The opposite of "fear," 1Jo 4:18. Herein is our love perfected, namely, in God dwelling in us, and our dwelling in God (1Jo 4:16), involving as its result "that we can have confidence (or boldness) in the day of judgment" (so terrible to all other men, Ac 24:25; Ro 2:16).<p>because, &c.&#8212;The ground of our "confidence" is, "because even as He (Christ) is, we also are in this world" (and He will not, in that day, condemn those who are like Himself), that is, we are righteous as He is righteous, especially in respect to that which is the sum of righteousness, love (1Jo 3:14). Christ IS righteous, and love itself, in heaven: so are we, His members, who are still "in this world." Our oneness with Him even now in His exalted position above (Eph 2:6), so that all that belongs to Him of righteousness, &c., belongs to us also by perfect imputation and progressive impartation, is the ground of our love being perfected so that we can have confidence in the day of judgment. We are in, not of, this world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_john/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> And by this means (viz. of our inwardness with God) doth our love grow to that perfection, that we shall have the most fearless freedom and liberty of spirit in the judgment day; our hearts no way misgiving to appear before him as a Judge, whose very image we find upon ourselves, he having beforehand, made us such even in this world, though in an infinitely inferior degree, as he is, compositions of love and goodness. Or, if <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the day of judgment</span> should mean, as some conceive, of our appearance before human tribunals for his sake, such a temper of spirit must give us the same boldness in that case also. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_john/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Herein is our love made perfect,.... Or love with us; which some understand of the love of God towards his people, and which is shed abroad in them: this indeed removes all fear of an awful judgment, and renders that amiable and desirable; and such who are interested in it, shall stand in that day with intrepidity and boldness; and this sense may seem to be favoured by the Syriac version, which reads, "his love with us"; and especially by the Vulgate Latin version, which renders it, "the love of God with us"; but it is best to understand it agreeably to the context, of our love to God, which is with and in our hearts; and which is made, or made to appear to be perfect, true, and genuine, by our love to the brethren; since the love of God to us does not admit of degrees, nor does it, or the reality and sincerity of it, depend upon our love to the saints; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12</a>; <p>that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; not of men's judgment, when brought before judges, governors, and kings, for the sake of Christ and the Gospel, and stand at their bar, where saints, who have true love to God and Christ and the brethren, have stood with great courage and intrepidity, and shown much boldness, and used great freedom of speech; nor of judgment in this life, which sometimes begins at the house of God, though the saints often have great boldness and presence of mind, and freedom of expression both to God and man in a day of affliction, as Job had; but of the future judgment, which, though it will be very awful and solemn, Christ the Judge will appear with great majesty and glory, and all men will stand before him, and the books will be opened, and the judgment will proceed with great strictness and justice, and will issue in the everlasting perdition of devils and wicked men, yet the saints will have boldness in it: while evil men and devils tremble at the thoughts of it now, they rejoice and are glad; they love it, look for it, long for it, and hasten to it; and will stand fearless, and without the least dread, while others will flee to the rocks, and into the holes of the earth; and they will use freedom of speech with Christ, as the word here signifies; they will sing his new song, and ascribe the glory of their salvation to him, and express their praises of him, and love to him, then and to all eternity: and this boldness the saints may be said to arrive at through a perfect, or sincere, and genuine love of the brethren; for by this they know they are born again, and are born to an inheritance incorruptible, which they have both a meetness for, and a right unto; and knowing hereby that they are passed from death to life, they justly conclude they shall not enter into condemnation, and therefore are not afraid of the awful judgment: hereby they know that their faith is right, and that therefore they are manifestly the children of God; and if children, then heirs, and so shall be saved, and have everlasting life: <p>because as he is, so are we in this world; which may be understood either of God, to whom the saints are like; for such who are born again, as those who love the brethren are, they are partakers of the divine nature, and bear a resemblance to God, even in this present state of things; and as it becomes them to be holy in all manner of conversation, as he is holy, and to be merciful to wicked men, as he is merciful, so to love the saints as he does, and to be kind, tenderhearted, and forgive one another, as he for Christ's sake has forgiven them; for as God is love, they should be all love likewise; or of Christ, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a>; and that with respect to God; as he is the Son of God, so are they the sons of God; he by nature, they by grace and adoption; as he is loved by God with an everlasting and unchangeable love, with a love of complacency and delight, so are they loved by him with the same kind of love, even while they are in this world; and as he is the chosen of God, and precious, so they are chosen in him, and unto salvation by him. The Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, render it, "as he was": and the sense may be, as he was in this world, so are they; and which may regard not so much likeness in nature, though there is an agreement in that, excepting sin, but the sameness of state and condition; as he was a man of sorrows, attended with afflictions, loaded with reproaches, and followed with the persecutions of men, so are they; nor need they wonder that they are the objects of the world's hatred and contempt, since he was also; as he was tempted by Satan, forsaken by his friends, and deserted by his God, so sometimes are they in this world; and as he went through a variety of sufferings, and death itself, to glory, so through many tribulations do they enter the kingdom: moreover, as he now is in heaven, so are they in this world; even as he is in heaven, so are they representatively in him, while in this world; and as he is righteous, being justified and acquitted from all the charge of sin he took upon him, and therefore will appear a second time without sin, so they are completely righteous in him: and once more, as he is, so they are, or should be in this world; they should be holy as he is holy, and be humble, meek, and patient, as he is, and walk as he walked; and particularly love the saints and one another, as he does; and which seems to be greatly intended here, and must be understood not of an equality, but of a likeness. The Arabic version reads the words conditionally, and as depending on the preceding clause, "if as he was, we are in this world"; and then the sense is, that the saints shall have boldness in the day of judgment, provided they are in this world as Christ was. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{13}</span> Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> as he is, so are we in this world.</span><p>(13) Again (as before) he commends love, seeing that by our agreement with God in this thing, we have a sure testimony of our adoption, it comes to pass by this that without fear we look for that latter day of judgment, so that trembling and torment of conscience is cast out by this love.<p>(i) This signifies a likeness, not an equality.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_john/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>.

What sort of character is meant must be inferred from the context; it is entirely arbitrary to find the similarity in the temptation (Rickli) or in the sufferings of Christ (Grotius), or in the fact that Christ was in the world but not of it (Sander), for there is no such reference in the context. But it is also inadmissible to regard as the more particular definition of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘΏς</span></span></span> the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗ</span></span></span> (Düsterdieck), or the Sonship of God (Lücke: “as Christ is the Son of God, so are we also children of God”), for neither do these ideas appear in the context. We are rather to go back to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΜΈΝΩΝ ἘΝ Τῇ ἈΓΆΠῌ</span></span></span>, and accordingly to refer <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΘΏς</span></span></span> to <span class="ital">love</span> (so Lorinus: “reddit nos charitas Christo similes et conformes imagini filii Dei;” Bengel, de Wette, Ewald, Myrberg, Braune, etc.[278]), so that the sense is: “if we live in love, then we do not fear the judgment of Christ, because then we are like Him, and He therefore cannot condemn us.”[279] The present <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> is to be retained as a present, and not to be turned into the preterite (Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς ἘΚΕῖΝΟς ἮΝ ἘΝ Τῷ ΚΌΣΜῼ ἌΜΩΜΟς ΚΑῚ ΚΑΘΑΡΌς</span></span></span>).

In the concluding words: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῷ ΚΌΣΜῼ ΤΟΎΤῼ</span></span></span>, which belong, not to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΣΤΙ</span></span></span>, but <span class="ital">only</span> to <span class="greekheb">ἐσμεν</span>, it is brought out that we are still <span class="ital">in the earthly world</span> (<span class="greekheb">κόσμος οὗτος</span> is not an ethical idea), whereas Christ has already ascended from it into heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[272] Sander: “That <span class="ital">it is made perfect</span> must only mean: this love of God which was manifested in the sending of His Son is manifested in its might and glory in this, that, as overcoming everything, it brings us so far that we,” etc.—Calovius: Perficitur dilectio Dei in nobis, non ratione sui, sic enim absolute perfecta est, sed ratione nostri, non quoad existentiam, sed quoad experientiam.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[273] Hence <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μεθʼ ἡμῶν</span> is neither = <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγ</span>. (<span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>) <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἡμᾶς</span>, nor = <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span>) <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀλλήλους</span>, as Lücke in his 1st ed. interprets (“our love among ourselves, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> our mutual love”); still less justifiable is the interpretation of Rickli: “the mutual love between God and the believer;” for John never includes God and men in <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span>. When Ebrard, admitting this, nevertheless accepts the interpretation of Rickli as far as the sense is concerned, explaining “the love of God with us” by “the love which exists between God and us,” this is purely arbitrary, for even though <span class="greekheb">μετά</span> is frequently used to denote a <span class="ital">reciprocal action</span> (see Winer, p. 336; VII. p. 352 ff.), yet this reference is here unsuitable, for it is not <span class="ital">God</span> and <span class="ital">we</span>, but <span class="ital">love</span> and <span class="ital">we</span>, that are placed together. Moreover, to supply <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη</span> is at the best only defensible if in <span class="greekheb">μεθʼ ἡμῶν</span> the subject to which the love refers is stated; but this is grammatically impossible. If, as Ebrard thinks, <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη</span> denotes not love, but the love-<span class="ital">relationship</span>, then <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη μεθʼ ἡμῶν</span> may only mean “the loving-relationship that exists among us;” this idea, however, as Ebrard with justice says, does not suit the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[274] According to Bertheau’s note in the 3d ed. of Lücke’s <span class="ital">Commentary</span> (p. 364), Lücke has, however, in the edition of 1851 interpreted <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη</span>: “brotherly love combined with love to God.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[275] Beza’s interpretation runs: Charitas adimpletur in nobis per hoc quod qualis ille est, tales et nos simus in hoc mundo, ut fiduciam habeamus in die judicii.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[276] In Luther’s version, <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησία</span> is here, as elsewhere frequently, translated by “<span class="ital">Freudigkeit;</span>” this is not a word derived from “Freude” (joy), but the old German word “Freidikeit” (from “freidic, fraidig”) = haughtiness, boldness, confidence (comp. Vilmar’s <span class="ital">pastoral-theol. Blätter</span>, 1861, vols. I. and II. p. 110 ff.); in the older editions it is written sometimes “freydickeyt” (Wittenb. ed. 1525), sometimes freydigkeit (Nürnberg ed. 1524), but in 1537 (in a Strasburg ed.) “freudigkeit.” In what sense Luther understood the word is clearly seen from a sermon on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-16.htm" title="And we have known and believed the love that God has to us. God is love; and he that dwells in love dwells in God, and God in him....">1 John 4:16-21</a> (see Plochmann’s ed. XIX. 383), in which he says: “he means that faith should thus show itself, so that when the last day comes, you may have <span class="ital">boldness</span> and stand firm.” It is to be observed also that such Hebrew and Greek words as contain the idea of joy Luther never translates by that word (“boldness”), but by “joyous,” “joy.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[277] Braune, though he explains correctly the particular thought, denies that these two elements are here to be regarded as combined; but without entering into the difficulty which lies in the expression. Ebrard states the meaning of the words incorrectly thus: “In the fact that the <span class="ital">will</span> of God, that we should have boldness in the day of judgment, is internally revealed to us, and manifests itself as a power (of confidence) in us (even now), the loving relationship of God with us is shown to be perfect.” How many elements foreign to the context are here introduced!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[278] The reference of <span class="greekheb">καθώς</span> to love is the only one demanded by the context, so that it is not suitable to regard love only as a single element in the likeness of believers to Christ which is here spoken of, as is the case with Lücke, for instance. Erdmann lays the chief emphasis not so much on love as on fellowship with God, which exists in love; but by <span class="greekheb">καθὼς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐστι</span> it is not a relationship, but a quality that is indicated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[279] Ebrard in his interpretation arrives at no definite result; as, on his supposition that the centre of the tertii comparationis lies in the words <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ τούτῳ</span>, the present <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> is objectionable to him, he would prefer to conjecture “<span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span>” instead of <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span>; but “as a faithful attention to the requirements of Biblical exegesis would scarcely permit such a conjecture,” he thinks that nothing else remains but either to suppose that <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> (in the sense of a historical present) “is added as an indifferent, colourless word,” or to refer <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἐκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐστιν</span> to the fact that Christ even now “still exists in the wicked world <span class="ital">to a certain extent</span>, namely, in the Church, which is His body.” Ebrard regards the second conjecture as the more correct, and in accordance with it thus states the sense: “We look forward to the judgment with boldness, for, as He (in His Church) is still persecuted by the wicked world (even at the present day), so are we also in this world (as lambs among wolves)” (!). Ebrard groundlessly maintains, against the explanation given in the text, “that with it an <span class="greekheb">οὕτως</span> could not be omitted, nay, that even this would not suffice, but that it would have to read: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οἷος ἐκεῖνός ἐστι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοιοῦτοι καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐσμεν</span>, and that even then the passage remains obscure enough;” and “that with this acceptation <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. almost appears quite superfluous and foreign.” Against the statement that “our confidence in view of the judgment could not possibly be founded on our likeness to Christ, but only on the love of God as manifested in Christ,” it is a decisive answer that John in other passages as well makes the <span class="greekheb">παῤῥησία</span> dependent upon <span class="ital">our</span> character, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-21.htm" title="Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.">1 John 3:21</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">τετελείωται</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time.

V., <span class="ital">Herein is love</span> <span class="bld">made perfect with us</span>. Most earlier English Versions agree with the latter collocation. The meaning seems to be that love, which is of God (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.">1 John 4:7</a></span>), takes up its abode <span class="ital">with us</span> and is developed until it is perfected. ‘Love’ here evidently means our love towards God: His love towards us can have no fear about it (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-18.htm" title="There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear: because fear has torment. He that fears is not made perfect in love.">1 John 4:18</a></span>). ‘Herein’ may refer to either of the two clauses which follow. ‘Herein … that’ (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>) occurs possibly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-8.htm" title="Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.">John 15:8</a>, and ‘Herein … because’ (<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>) occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1 John 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-9.htm" title="In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him....">1 John 4:9-10</a>. But it is perhaps best to make ‘Herein’ refer to what precedes; to our abiding in God and God in us. This avoids the awkwardness of making perfection of love in the <span class="ital">present</span> depend upon our attitude at the Judgment, which though near (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>) according to S.

In this way we can give its full meaning to ‘that’ (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>): by close union with God our love is made perfect, <span class="ital">in order that</span> we may have boldness in the day of judgment.

Our assurance with regard to the future Judgment is not presumption, because in this world we are in character like Christ. The resemblance is marked as close, ‘<span class="ital">even</span> so are we’ (<span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1 John 2:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-3.htm" title="And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.">1 John 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm" title="Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.">1 John 3:7</a>.

Two explanations are given. (1.) To the following that we may have boldness. So Huther, who argues thus on the ground that <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a> shows that the drift of the writer's thought is toward the fearlessness of love. According to this, therefore, love has its fulfillment in freeing us from fear, and inspiring us with boldness even in view of the final judgment. (2.) To what precedes, viz., our dwelling in God and He in us. So Westcott: "The fellowship of God with man and of man with God, carries with it the consummation of love." I prefer the latter, principally on the ground that in such phrases as &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837; in this, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; on this account, therefore, the pronoun usually refers to something preceding, though more fully developed in what follows. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-16.htm">John 5:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm">John 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-65.htm">John 6:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-18.htm">John 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-15.htm">John 16:15</a>.<p>Our love (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;' &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>The A.V. construes &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;' &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; with us, with love, making with us equivalent to our. In that case it might mean either the love which is between Christians, or the love which is between God and Christians. The Rev. construes with us with the verb: love is made perfect with us. The latter is preferable. I do not think it would be easy to point out a parallel in the New Testament to the expression &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;' love that with us  equals  our love. The true idea is that love is perfected in fellowship. The love of God is perfected with us, in communion with us, through our abiding in Him and He in us. "Love is not simply perfected in man, but in fulfilling this issue God works with man" (Westcott). Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm">2 John 1:3</a>, "grace shall be with us" (true reading); and <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/25-4.htm">Acts 25:4</a>, "what things God had done with them."
