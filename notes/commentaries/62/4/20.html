Indeed, we never could love him unless, as the apostle observes, his love were <span class="ital">shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given to us. And this commandment have we from him </span>— Both from God and Christ; <span class="ital">that he who loveth God, love his brother </span>in Christ <span class="ital">also </span>— That is, every one, whatever his opinions or modes of worship may be, purely because he is the child and bears the image of God. Bigotry is properly the want of this pure and universal love. A bigot only loves those who embrace his opinions, and he loves them for that, not for Christ’s sake. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:14-21 The Father sent the Son, he willed his coming into this world. The apostle attests this. And whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. This confession includes faith in the heart as the foundation; makes acknowledgment with the mouth to the glory of God and Christ, and profession in the life and conduct, against the flatteries and frowns of the world. There must be a day of universal judgment. Happy those who shall have holy boldness before the Judge at that day; knowing he is their Friend and Advocate! Happy those who have holy boldness in the prospect of that day, who look and wait for it, and for the Judge's appearance! True love to God assures believers of God's love to them. Love teaches us to suffer for him and with him; therefore we may trust that we shall also be glorified with him, 2Ti 2:12. We must distinguish between the fear of God and being afraid of him; the fear of God imports high regard and veneration for God. Obedience and good works, done from the principle of love, are not like the servile toil of one who unwillingly labours from dread of a master's anger. They are like that of a dutiful child, who does services to a beloved father, which benefit his brethren, and are done willingly. It is a sign that our love is far from perfect, when our doubts, fears, and apprehensions of God, are many. Let heaven and earth stand amazed at his love. He sent his word to invite sinners to partake of this great salvation. Let them take the comfort of the happy change wrought in them, while they give him the glory. The love of God in Christ, in the hearts of Christians from the Spirit of adoption, is the great proof of conversion. This must be tried by its effects on their temper, and their conduct to their brethren. If a man professes to love God, and yet indulges anger or revenge, or shows a selfish disposition, he gives his profession the lie. But if it is plain that our natural enmity is changed into affection and gratitude, let us bless the name of our God for this seal and earnest of eternal happiness. Then we differ from the false professors, who pretend to love God, whom they have not seen, yet hate their brethren, whom they have seen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother - His Christian brother; or, in a larger sense, any man.

The sense is, that this must be a false profession.<p>For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen ... - It is more reasonable to expect that we should love one whom we have seen and known personally, than that we should love one whom we have not seen. The apostle is arguing from human nature as it is, and everyone feels that we are more likely to love one with whom we are familiar than one who is a stranger. If a professed Christian, therefore, does not love one who bears the divine image, whom he sees and knows, how can he love that God whose image he bears, whom he has not seen?

"Nature is prior to grace; and we by nature love things seen, before we love things unseen" [Estius]. The eyes are our leaders in love. "Seeing is an incentive to love" [ŒCUMENIUS]. If we do not love the brethren, the visible representatives of God, how can we love God, the invisible One, whose children they are? The true ideal of man, lost in Adam, is realized in Christ, in whom God is revealed as He is, and man as he ought to be. Thus, by faith in Christ, we learn to love both the true God, and the true man, and so to love the brethren as bearing His image.<p>hath seen&#8212;and continually sees.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_john/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The greater difficulty here is implied, through our present dependence upon sense, of loving the invisible God, than men that we daily see and converse familiarly with.

The truth that he who hates (or, does not love) his brother, also does not love God, the apostle confirms by the contrast between <span class="greekheb">ὃν ἑώρακε</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὃν οὐχ ἑώρακεν</span>, in which the <span class="ital">visibility</span> of the brother is contrasted with the <span class="ital">invisibility</span> of God. The perfect indicates the permanent state; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.">1 John 4:12</a>, Gospel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>. Lücke: <span class="greekheb">ἑωρακέναι</span> = “to have before one’s eyes;” a Lapide: “vidit et assidue videt.” Socinus incorrectly lays a certain emphasis on the preterite when he says: quandoquidem satis est ad amorem per cognitionem alicujus erga illum excitandum, quod quis ipsum aliquando viderit; nee necesse est, ut etiam nunc illum videat. The premiss for the conclusion of the apostle is, that the visible—as the object directly presented to the sight—is more easily loved than the invisible. Even the natural man turns with love to the visible,[285] whereas love to God, as the Unseen, requires an elevation of the heart of which only the saved are capable. Hence brotherly love is the easier, love to God is the more difficult. In him who rejects the former, the latter has certainly no place. The truth that love to God is the condition of Christian brotherly love, is not in contradiction with this; for that love, as the glorification of natural love, has its necessary basis in the natural inclination which we have to our visible brother, who is like us. It is therefore unnecessary to attach any importance to elements which the apostle here leaves quite untouched, as is the case with Calvin (with whom Sander, Ebrard, etc., agree) when he says: Apostolus hic pro confesso sumit, Deum se nobis in hominibus offerre, qui insculptam gerunt <span class="ital">ejus imaginem;</span> Joannes nil aliud voluit, quam fallacem esse jactantiam, si quis Deum se amare dicat, et <span class="ital">ejus imaginem</span>, quae ante oculos est, negligat;[286] and with de Wette in his interpretation: “the brother is the visible empiric object of love; whereas God, the ideal invisible object, can really be loved <span class="ital">only in him.</span>” By the interrogative: <span class="greekheb">πῶς δύναται ἀγαπᾷν</span> (comp. chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1 John 3:17</a>), and by placing the object <span class="greekheb">τὸν Θεόν</span> first, the expression gains in vivacity and point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πῶς δύναται</span> must not be taken: “how can he attain to that?” but: “how can we suppose that he loves?” (Baumgarten-Crusius).

Hornejus: Sicut omnis cognitio nostra communiter a sensu incipit, ita amor quoque, unde facilius et prius amatur, quod facilius et promptius cognoscitur.

XI. in Evang.</span>): Oculi sunt in amore duces; and Philo (<span class="ital">ad Decalog.</span>): <span class="greekheb">ἀμήχανον εὐσεβεῖσθαι τὸν ἀόρατον ὑπὸ τῶν εἰς τοὺς ἐμφανεῖς καὶ ἐγγὺς ἀσεβούντων</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[286] The objection of Ebrard, that “it is not easier to love a person who stands visibly before me, and has, for instance, <span class="ital">injured</span> me, than a person whom I have not seen at all,” is overthrown by the fact that the apostle does not here make the slightest reference to the conduct of persons standing in visible opposition to us, by whom the natural feeling of love towards our equals is destroyed and turned into hate. As the apostle is contrasting the elements of visibility and invisibility, it is so much the more arbitrary to introduce here a reference to the imago Dei, as this is not something visible, but something invisible,—the object, not of sight, but of faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-20.htm" title="If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?">1 John 4:20</a>. Lest the vagueness of the objectless <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπῶμεν</span> encourage false security, St. John reiterates the old test: Love for the invisible Father is manifested in love for the brother by our side, the image of the Father. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Whittier:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Not thine the bigot’s partial plea,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor thine the zealot’s ban;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thou well canst spare a love of thee<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Which ends in hate of man”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ψεύστης</span>, see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">If a man say</span>] We return to the form of statement which was so common at the beginning of the Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-10.htm" title="If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.">1 John 1:10</a>).

John treats not loving as equivalent to hating.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whom he hath seen</span>] S. John does not say ‘whom he can see’, but ‘whom he has continually before his eyes’. The perfect tense, as so often, expresses a permanent state continuing from the past. His brother has been and remains in sight, God has been and remains out of sight. ‘Out of sight, out of mind’ is a saying which holds good in morals and religion as well as in society. And if a man fails in duties which are ever before his eyes and are easy, how can we credit him with performing duties which require an effort to bear in mind and are difficult? And in this case the seen would necessarily suggest the unseen: for the <span class="ital">brother</span> on earth implies the <span class="ital">Father</span> in heaven. If therefore even the seen is not loved, what must we infer as to the unseen? The seen brother and the unseen God are put in striking juxtaposition in the Greek; ‘He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, the God whom he hath not seen cannot love’. But in English this would be misunderstood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">how can he love</span>] With <span class="greekheb">א</span>B against AKL we should probably read <span class="bld">cannot love</span>: the ‘how’ is perhaps a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1 John 3:17</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-4.htm" title="Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?">John 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-9.htm" title="Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?">John 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-44.htm" title="How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?">John 5:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-52.htm" title="The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?">John 6:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day.

To love God and hate one's brother is impossible. Sight, though not necessary to affection, aids it; and it is therefore easier to love men than God.
