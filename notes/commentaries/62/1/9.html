The great God should be represented to this dark world, as pure and perfect light. As this is the nature of God, his doctrines and precepts must be such. And as his perfect happiness cannot be separated from his perfect holiness, so our happiness will be in proportion to our being made holy. To walk in darkness, is to live and act against religion. God holds no heavenly fellowship or intercourse with unholy souls. There is no truth in their profession; their practice shows its folly and falsehood. The eternal Life, the eternal Son, put on flesh and blood, and died to wash us from our sins in his own blood, and procures for us the sacred influences by which sin is to be subdued more and more, till it is quite done away. While the necessity of a holy walk is insisted upon, as the effect and evidence of the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, the opposite error of self-righteous pride is guarded against with equal care. All who walk near to God, in holiness and righteousness, are sensible that their best days and duties are mixed with sin. God has given testimony to the sinfulness of the world, by providing a sufficient, effectual Sacrifice for sin, needed in all ages; and the sinfulness of believers themselves is shown, by requiring them continually to confess their sins, and to apply by faith to the blood of that Sacrifice. Let us plead guilty before God, be humble, and willing to know the worst of our case. Let us honestly confess all our sins in their full extent, relying wholly on his mercy and truth through the righteousness of Christ, for a free and full forgiveness, and our deliverance from the power and practice of sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If we confess our sins - Pardon in the Scriptures, always supposes that there is confession, and there is no promise that it will be imparted unless a full acknowledgment has been made. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1-11</a>;; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-18.htm">Luke 15:18</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-41.htm">Luke 7:41</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>.<p>He is faithful - To his promises. He will do what he has assured us he will do in remitting them.<p>And just to forgive us our sins - The word "just" here cannot be used in a strict and proper sense, since the forgiveness of sins is never an act of justice, but is an act of mercy. If it were an act of justice it could be demanded or enforced, and that is the same as to say that it is not forgiveness, for in that case there could have been no sin to be pardoned. But the word "just" is often used in a larger sense, as denoting upright, equitable, acting properly in the circumstances of the case, etc. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19</a>. Here the word may be used in one of the following senses:<p>(1) Either as referring to his general excellence of character, or his disposition to do what is proper; that is, he is one who will act in every way as becomes God; or,<p>(2) that he will be just in the sense that he will be true to his promises; or that, since he has promised to pardon sinners, he will be found faithfully to adhere to those engagements; or perhaps,<p>(3) that he will be just to his Son in the covenant of redemption, since, now that an atonement has been made by him, and a way has been opened through his sufferings by which God can consistently pardon, and with a view and an understanding that he might and would pardon, it would be an act of injustice to him if he did not pardon those who believe on him.<p>Viewed in either aspect, we may have the fullest assurance that God is ready to pardon us if we exercise true repentance and faith. No one can come to God without finding him ready to do all that is appropriate for a God to do in pardoning transgressors; no one who will not, in fact, receive forgiveness if he repents, and believes, and makes confession; no one who will not find that God is just to his Son in the covenant of redemption, in pardoning and saving all who put their trust in the merits of his sacrifice.<p>And to cleanse us from all unrighteousness - By forgiving all that is past, treating us as if we were righteous, and ultimately by removing all the stains of guilt from the soul. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. confess&#8212;with the lips, speaking from a contrite heart; involving also confession to our fellow men of offenses committed against them.<p>he&#8212;God.<p>faithful&#8212;to His own promises; "true" to His word.<p>just&#8212;Not merely the mercy, but the justice or righteousness of God is set forth in the redemption of the penitent believer in Christ.

Not to one other; for though it is our duty to confess our faults to our fellow creatures and fellow Christians which are committed against them, yet are under no obligation to confess such as are more immediately against God, and which lie between him and ourselves; or at least it is sufficient to confess and acknowledge in general what sinful creatures we are, without entering into particulars; for confession of sin is to be made to God, against whom it is committed, and who only can pardon: and a man that truly confesses his sin is one that the Spirit of God has convinced of it, and has shown him its exceeding sinfulness, and filled him with a godly sorrow for it, and given him repentance unto salvation, that needeth not to be repented of; and who, under such a sight and sense of sin, and concern for it, comes and acknowledges it before the Lord, humbly imploring, for Christ's sake, his pardoning grace and mercy; and such obtain it: <p>he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins: forgiveness of sin here intends not the act of forgiveness, as in God, proceeding upon the bloodshed and sacrifice of Christ, which is done at once, and includes all sin, past, present, and to come; but an application of pardoning grace to a poor sensible sinner, humbled under a sense of sin, and confessing it before the Lord; and confession of sin is not the cause or condition of pardon, nor of the manifestation of it, but is descriptive of the person, and points him out, to whom God will and does make known his forgiving love; for to whomsoever he grants repentance, he gives the remission of sin; in doing of which he is faithful to his word of promise; such as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>; "and just"; in being "true", as the Arabic version adds, to his word; and showing a proper regard to the blood and sacrifice of his Son; for his blood being shed, and hereby satisfaction made to the law and justice of God, it is a righteous thing in him to justify from sin, and forgive the sinner for whom Christ has shed his blood, and not impute it to him, or punish him for it; though the word here used may answer to the Hebrew word  which sometimes carries in it the notion and idea of mercy and beneficence; hence mercy to the poor is sometimes expressed by righteousness; and the righteous acts of God intend his mercies and benefits unto men; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>; and so forgiveness of sin springs from the tender mercies of our God, and is both an act of justice and of mercy; of justice, with respect to the blood of Christ, and of pure grace and mercy to the pardoned sinner: the following clause, <p>and to cleanse us, from all unrighteousness, is but the same thing expressed in different words; for all unrighteousness is sin, and to cleanse from sin is to remove the guilt of it, by an application of the blood of Christ for pardon. The antecedent to the relative "he" in the text, is either God, who is light, and with whom the saints have fellowship; or his Son Jesus Christ, who is the nearest antecedent, and who, being truly God, has a power to forgive sin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> If we confess our sins, he is <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> faithful and just to <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> forgive us <i>our</i> sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</span><p>(6) Therefore the beginning of salvation is to acknowledge our wickedness and to require pardon from him, who freely forgives all sins, because he has promised to do so and he is faithful and just.<p>(g) So then our salvation depends on the free promise of God, who because he is faithful and just, will perform that which he hath promised.<p>(h) Where then are our merits? for this is our true happiness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_john/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>.

The relation of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗ</span></span></span> of God to His judicial activity is found throughout in the N.

As the manifestation of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΊΑ ΚΡΊΣΙς</span></span></span> of God consists in the righteous distribution of punishment and of blessing, it follows that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗ</span></span></span> is referred to not only where both of these are mentioned together (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you also suffer:">2 Thessalonians 1:5</a> seq.), but also where only one of the two is spoken of.

Here God is called <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΊΚΑΙΟς</span></span></span>, inasmuch as His purpose is directed to allotting to those who, walking in light, confess their sins, that which is suitable for them, namely, the blessing mentioned in the following <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> The meaning of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΊΚΑΙΟς</span></span></span> is rightly stated by Baumgarten-Crusius, Düsterdieck, Brückner, and Braune;[67] on the other hand, it is incorrect to refer <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΊΚΑΙΟς</span></span></span> here to the <span class="ital">punitive</span> activity (Drusius: justus, quia vere punivit peccata nostra in filio suo), but also to explain it = bonis, lenis, aequus (Grotius, Lange, Carpzov, etc.), for <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> never has this meaning in the N. T.; it is here of cognate meaning with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΙΣΤΌς</span></span></span>,[68] because the allotment of blessing bestowed in accordance with the <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> of God has been promised by Him, and is accomplished according to His promise; yet it must not therefore be regarded as synonymous with it (Hornejus: = in promissis servandis integer). Following <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-26.htm" title="To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.">Romans 3:26</a>, some commentators have here interpreted it = <span class="greekheb">δικαιῶν</span>; but this is so much the more unjustifiable, as that very passage by the juxtaposition of the two ideas proves their different meaning.[69] According to the Roman Catholic view, <span class="greekheb">πιστός</span> refers to the peccata mortalia, <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> to the peccata venialia.[70]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἀφῇ ἡμῖν τὰς ἁμαρτίας</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, not = “so that” (Castellio: ita Justus, ut condonet), has here (as in other passages of the N. T.) not retained strictly its idea of <span class="ital">purpose</span>, (hence not: “in order that”), but it states what is the aim of the divine faithfulness and justice to attain which these qualities operate on men; Luther therefore translates correctly: “<span class="ital">that.</span>” De Wette’s explanation, with which Braune agrees: “in the divine faithfulness lies the law or the will of forgiving sins,” is unsatisfactory, inasmuch as <span class="greekheb">ἀφιέναι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is not merely the <span class="ital">will</span>, but the operation of the divine faithfulness and justice.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὰς ἁμαρτίας</span> refers back to <span class="greekheb">ὁμολογῶμεν τὰς ἁμαρτίας</span>, thus: “the sins confessed by us.” The <span class="ital">remission, i.e.</span> the forgiveness, of sins is therefore, by virtue of the faithfulness of God, the first result of the confession; the second John describes by the words: <span class="greekheb">καὶ καθαρίσῃ</span>[71] <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ πάσης ἀδικίας</span>. Here the first thought is not repeated epexegetically (Semler), or only in figurative manner (Lange); but the words express the same thing as the corresponding words of the 7th verse, with which the 8th and 9th verses are in closest connection (Düsterdieck, Braune; Brückner does not explain himself definitely); <span class="greekheb">καθαρίζειν</span> has here the same meaning as there, and <span class="greekheb">ἀδικία</span> (not = poena peccati, Socinus) is synonymous with <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span>; they are two different names for the same thing; comp. chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-17.htm" title="All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not to death.">1 John 5:17</a>.[72] The order in which the two clauses that express the redemptive operations of God are connected together (Myrberg: ordo verborum ponit remissionem ante abrogationem), points to the fact that purification takes place by means of forgiveness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The context is quite decisive in favour of regarding as the subject of <span class="greekheb">πιστός ἐστι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. not <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span>, but (with Lücke, de Wette, Düsterdieck, Braune, etc.) <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span>; for even though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1 John 1:7</a> the <span class="greekheb">καθαρίζειν</span> is described as the operation of the <span class="greekheb">αἷμα Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>, and in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1 John 2:2</a>, <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>. is the subject, yet in this section <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span> is the principal subject; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>, <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span>, even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1 John 1:7</a>, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ υἱοῦ αὐτοῦ</span>; the blood of Christ, therefore, is regarded as the means by which <span class="ital">God</span> produces purification from sins.

In genuine Catholic fashion a Lapide says: Quam confessionem exigit Johannes? Haeretici solam generalem quae fit Deo admittunt; Catholici etiam specialem requirunt.

And hereby we know that he stays in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.">1 John 3:24</a> of the passage in Romans, but here the <span class="ital">source</span> of the salvation is not mentioned.—The interpretation of Calov: “justa est haec peccatorum remissio et ex justitia debita, sed Christo non nobis,” and that of Sander: “the Lord is just, inasmuch as He remits the sin of the sinner who appeals to the ransom paid in the blood of Christ, because it would be unjust to demand the payment twice,” introduce references into this passage which are foreign to it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[70] Suarez: <span class="ital">Fidelis</span> est Deus, cum condonat poenitentibus peccata mortalia; <span class="ital">justus</span>, cum justis condonat venialia, quia, <span class="ital">sc.</span> justi per <span class="ital">opera</span> (!) poenitentiae, charitatis, etc., merentur de condigno hanc condonationem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[71] The Rec. <span class="greekheb">καθαρίσει</span> corresponds to the passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-30.htm" title="That you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Luke 22:30</a>, where, according to the best attested Rec., <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> is followed both by the subjunctive first, and then by the indicative; but not to the passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm" title="And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:40</a>, cited by Ebrard, where the indicative is not regarded as dependent on <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>. On <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> with the indicative, comp. A. Buttmann’s <span class="ital">Gramm.</span> p. 202. Winer, p. 258 ff., VII. p. 271 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[72] While Weiss also interprets both expressions of the forgiveness of sins, he tries to repel the reproach of tautology by saying: “If sin committed is regarded as a stain, it is quite correct that God forgives us the sin, and thus purifies us from all unrighteousness, since by the very fact that God forgives it, sin has ceased to exist before Him, and at the same time also to stain us;” true though this may be, however, it cannot serve to refute that objection, for as <span class="greekheb">καθαρίζειν</span> in this sense is not the result of <span class="greekheb">ἀφιέναι</span>, but the former consists in the latter, both clauses express only one and the same thought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[73] In favour of conjoining Christ as the subject, Sander adduces the fact that just in the following chapter <span class="ital">Christ</span> is called <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>; but in this he overlooks altogether the different meanings which the word has in the two passages; for in the verse before us <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> is used of a relation to men, but in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1 John 2:1</a> of the relation of Christ to the divine will; and when Sander further says that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a> it is precisely stated of Christ that He purges the consciences, this is incorrect, since <span class="greekheb">τὸ αἷμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> is the subject there just as here in ver. 7; and there even more expressly than here God is specified as the author of the purification, for the <span class="greekheb">αἷμα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>. purges, because it is offered as a sacrifice <span class="greekheb">τῷ Θεῷ</span>. Moreover, it is not meant by this that forgiveness and cleansing could not be ascribed to Christ quite as much as to God, only it does not follow from this that <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span> is the subject here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">If we confess our sins</span>] The opposite hypothesis is now taken and expanded, as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1 John 1:7</a></span>; see note there. But there is no conjunction, no ‘but’, as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1 John 1:7</a></span>; and the asyndeton is telling. Greek has such a wealth of connecting particles, that in that language asyndeton is specially remarkable. Here there is expansion and progress, not only in the second half of the verse where ‘<span class="ital">He</span> is faithful and righteous’ takes the place of ‘<span class="ital">we</span> are true’; but in the first half also; where ‘confess <span class="ital">our sins</span>’ takes the place of ‘say <span class="ital">we have sin</span>’. The latter admission costs us little: the confession of the particular sins which we have committed costs a good deal, and is a guarantee of sincerity. He who refuses to confess, may perhaps desire, but certainly does not <span class="ital">seek</span> forgiveness. ‘He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-13.htm" title="He that covers his sins shall not prosper: but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy.">Proverbs 28:13</a>). Obviously confession to Him who is ‘faithful and righteous’, and to those ‘selves’ whom we should otherwise ‘lead astray’, is all that is meant. The passage has nothing to do with the question of confession to our fellow-men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">faithful and just</span>] Better, <span class="ital">faithful and</span> <span class="bld">righteous</span>, to bring out the contrast with ‘unrighteousness’ and the connexion with ‘Jesus Christ the righteous’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1 John 2:1</a>), where the same word (<span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>) is used. The Greek ‘and’ (<span class="greekheb">καί</span>) sometimes means ‘and yet’, and frequently does so in S. John: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm" title="He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.">John 1:10</a>. It is possible that it has this meaning here. ‘God is faithful (to His promises to us) <span class="ital">and yet</span> righteous (in hating and punishing sin)’. He keeps His promise of mercy to the penitent without losing His character for righteousness and justice. In any case beware of making ‘righteous’ a vague equivalent for ‘kind, gentle, merciful’. It means ‘just’ (which is to some extent the opposite of ‘merciful’), and affirms that God in keeping His word <span class="ital">gives to each his due</span>. The distinction which refers ‘faithful’ to mortal sins and ‘righteous’ to venial ones is frivolous. For ‘faithful’ in the sense of keeping promises comp. ‘He is faithful that promised’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-23.htm" title="Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;)">Hebrews 10:23</a>); ‘She counted Him faithful who had promised’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-11.htm" title="Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.">Hebrews 11:11</a>): and for ‘righteous’ in the sense of giving just awards comp. ‘Righteous art Thou … because Thou didst thus judge … True and righteous are Thy judgments’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/16-5.htm" title="And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have judged thus....">Revelation 16:5-7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to forgive us our sins</span>] In spite of what some eminent scholars have said to the contrary, it is perhaps true that the Greek for these words includes to some extent the idea of <span class="ital">intention</span> and <span class="ital">aim</span>. Thus the Vulgate, <span class="ital">fidelis est et justus, ut remittat nobis peccata nostra</span>; and Wiclif, ‘He is feithful and just <span class="ital">that</span> He forgeve to us oure synnes’; and the Rhemish, ‘He is faithful and just, <span class="ital">for to</span> forgive us our sinnes’. In S. John we find the conviction deeply rooted that all things happen in accordance with the decrees of God: events are the results of His purposes. And this conviction influences his language: so that constructions (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>) which originally indicated a <span class="ital">purpose</span>, and which even in late Greek do not lose this meaning entirely, are specially frequent in his writings: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a>. It is God’s decree and aim that His faithfulness and righteousness should appear in His forgiving us and cleansing us. Comp. ‘Against Thee, Thee only, have I sinned … that Thou mightest be justified when Thou speakest, and be clear when Thou judgest’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-4.htm" title="Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight: that you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge.">Psalm 51:4</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">our sins</span>] Those particular acts of sin which we have confessed, and from the punishment due for which we are thus set free. ‘I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-5.htm" title="I acknowledge my sin to you, and my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions to the LORD; and you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah.">Psalm 32:5</a>). ‘He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-13.htm" title="He that covers his sins shall not prosper: but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy.">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and to cleanse us</span>] This is not a repetition in different words; it is a second and distinct result of our confession: 1. We are absolved from sin’s punishment; 2. We are freed from sin’s pollution. The forgiveness is the averting of God’s wrath; the cleansing is the beginning of holiness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐὰν ὁμολογῶμεν τὰς ἁμαρτίας ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">if we confess our sins</span>) This verse is placed between two antithetical sentences, as ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-10.htm" title="He that loves his brother stays in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.">1 John 2:10</a>.

The former is concerning the <span class="ital">guilt</span> of sin, which <span class="ital">still</span> remains; the latter is concerning <span class="ital">the actual commission</span>. By the former, <span class="ital">we deceive ourselves</span>; by the latter, <span class="ital">we make Him a liar</span>.

Not the exact opposite, "if we confess <span class="accented">that we have sin</span>;" but "if we confess our sins." It is easy to say, "I am a sinner;" but if confession is to have value it must state the definite acts of sin. The context ("deceive <span class="accented">ourselves</span>...  <span class="accented">he</span> is faithful") shows that confession at the bar of the conscience and of God is meant. Circumstances must decide whether confession to man is required also, and this St. John neither forbids nor enjoins. Note the asyndeton; there is no <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, as in verse 7. <span class="cmt_word">He is faithful and righteous,</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> must be rendered "righteous" rather than "just," to mark the contrast with unrighteousness <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, and the connexion with "Jesus Christ the <span class="accented">Righteous"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>). To forgive...  to cleanse. As explained in verse 7, the one refers to freeing us from the penalties of sin, justification; the other to freeing us from its contamination, sanctification. The sense of <span class="accented">purpose</span> is not wholly to be surrendered. No doubt <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, like other particles, becomes weakened in later Greek; but even in later classical Greek the notion of purpose is mixed up with that of consequence. Much more is this the case in the New Testament, and especially in St. John, where what seems to us to be mere result is really design; and this higher aspect of the sequence of facts is indicated by <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>. It is God's nature to be faithful and righteous; but it is also his <span class="accented">purpose</span> to exhibit these attributes towards us; and this purpose is expressed in <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Confess (&#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>From &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, one and the same, and &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;, to say.

The same term is applied to Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-17.htm">Hebrews 2:17</a>). God's faithfulness is here spoken of not only as essential to His own being, but as faithfulness toward us; "fidelity to that nature of truth and light, related to His own essence, which rules in us as far as we confess our sins" (Ebrard). The essence of the message of life is fellowship with God and with His children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>). God is light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>). Walking in the light we have fellowship, and the blood of Jesus is constantly applied to cleanse us from sin, which is darkness and which interrupts fellowship. If we walk in darkness we do not the truth. If we deny our sin the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, "God, by whom we were called unto the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>) to forgive our sins, to cleanse us from all unrighteousness, and thus to restore and maintain the interrupted fellowship.<p>Just (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., righteous. From &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7; right. The term is applied both to God and to Christ. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>. The two words, faithful and righteous, imply each other. They unite in a true conception of God's character. God, who is absolute rightness, must be faithful to His own nature, and His righteous dealing with men who partake of that nature and walk in fellowship with Him, is simply fidelity to Himself. "Righteousness is truth passing into action" (Westcott).<p>To forgive (&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;)<p>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-23.htm">John 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-12.htm">1 John 2:12</a>. Primarily the word means to send away, dismiss; hence of sins, to remit, as a debt. Cleansing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>) contemplates the personal character of the sinner; remission, his acts. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-15.htm">James 5:15</a>. To forgive is, literally, that he may forgive. On John's use of &#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; in order that, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-31.htm">John 14:31</a>. Forgiveness answers to the essential purpose of His faithful and righteous being.<p>Our sins (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Sin is defined by John as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, lawlessness. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>. A.V., transgression of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>). It may be regarded either as condition or as act; either with reference to the normal, divine ideal of manhood, or to an external law imposed upon man by God. Any departure from the normal ideal of man as created in God's image puts man out of true relation and harmony with his true self, and therefore with God and with his fellowman. He thus comes into false, abnormal relation with right, love, truth, and light. He walks in darkness and forfeits fellowship with God. Lawlessness is darkness, lovelessness, selfishness. This false principle takes shape in act. He doeth (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;) or committeth sin. He doeth lawlessness (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>). He transgresses the words (&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-8.htm">John 17:8</a>) of God, and His commandments (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3</a>) as included and expressed in His one word or message (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm">1 John 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-14.htm">1 John 2:14</a>). Similarly the verb &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, to sin, may signify either to be sinful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>), or to commit sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-10.htm">1 John 1:10</a>). Sin, regarded both as principle and act, is designated by John by the term &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. The principle expressed in the specific acts is &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>), which occurs in this sense in Paul, but not in the Synoptists, nor in Acts. Many of the terms used for sin by other New Testament writers are wanting in John; as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; ungodliness (see on Jde 1:14); &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; to be ungodly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>); &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to transgress; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; transgression; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; transgressor (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-11.htm">James 2:11</a>); &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; to act contrary to the law; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; breach of law (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-16.htm">2 Peter 2:16</a>); &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; trespass (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14</a>).<p>To cleanse<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>.<p>continued...</body></html>
