A code and an example fitted for all times and all circumstances have been given by our Lord.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">He that saith . . .</span>—In particularising the general proposition according to his custom, St. John rejects the first person plural as shocking, unreal, and artificial, and throws the blasphemy on some third person. So “is a liar” is stronger than “we lie,” and “we deceive ourselves;” in such a case the lie has entered thoroughly into the man’s nature.<p>(5) <span class= "bld">But whoso keepeth his word.</span>—The revelation of the will of God, looked at as a whole.<p><span class= "bld">In him verily is the love of God perfected.</span>—St. John has before his mind an ideal of a man so filled with the Spirit that in all things he embodies the will of God; the love that such a man has for God is indeed complete. But he knows that the best of the human race can only approach such an ideal in different degrees, at a great distance; and the perfection of the love which they bear to God will vary in the same degree.

In the terms of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1John 2:3-5</a> there is a double gradation: on the one hand, knowing Him, being in Him, remaining in Him; on the other, keeping His commandments, keeping His word, walking even as He walked. The last expression is the strongest of the latter three, as it views the Christian in action. The walk of Christ was the walk in the light (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1John 1:7</a>); divine love the secret spring developing itself in a new virtue for every variety of circumstance.

The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.">1John 2:7-11</a> brotherly love is introduced as the special manifestation of this obedience that springs from the walk in the light. At a superficial glance it might have been thought that the personal address introduced a new paragraph; it is really only like the “Verily, verily,” of our Lord, breaking in to emphasize a message to be brought directly home to the hearts of the readers. The life of obedience, the walk in light, is nothing else but the life of brotherly love: “This is my commandment, that ye love one another” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-12.htm" title="This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.">John 15:12</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34-35</a>).<p>(7) <span class= "bld">I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., “</span>I am preparing to give you a special direction, which has been implied already by the walk in light. If you look at it from the point of view of your first entrance into Christ’s kingdom it is old, because it was the chief point of His moral teaching which you then heard. If you look at its effect in you it is new, because (1) it had never been taught so forcibly and clearly before Christ; (2) you are so imperfect that you are always liable to forget it; (3) your obedience to the command can never be complete, but will always require fresh growth; (4) it can never be permanent without continual renewal by Christ’s presence.” “Ye” is therefore his present Christian audience; “<span class= "ital">from the beginning”</span> implies the time of their conversion; “<span class= "ital">the word”</span> is here less wide than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1John 2:6</a>, and means rather Christ’s teaching on this point.

(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1John 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">is passing away</span>; <span class= "ital">already shineth.</span> Here he gives the reason why he announces as new what he says is already truly realised in Christ and in process of realisation in His people. A visible change, a notable renovation, is going on; the gross darkness that covered the face of the earth is being rent away in the circle of the apostolic preaching; the life of the Lord, which gleamed forth for three-and-thirty years in the cities and on the hill-sides of Judæa and Samaria and Galilee, is now bursting far and wide into ever-increasing brightness; wondrously quick is the spread of the rays of His glory; multitudes in every known land are gathered into His kingdom. Old things are passing away as the Apostle looks round, and all things are becoming new.

And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And hereby we do know that we know him - To wit, by that which follows, we have evidence that we are truly acquainted with him, and with the requirements of his religion; that is, that we are truly his friends.

By <span class="greekheb">ἐγνώκαμεν</span> the element of consciousness in the fellowship, and with this its internal and spiritual side, is brought out.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐὰν τὰς ἐντολὰς αὐτοῦ τηρῶμεν</span>] The expression <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐντολ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τηρεῖν</span>[93] describes the obedience resulting from the internal faithful keeping of the commandments;[94] it is incorrect, with Braune, so to press the idea <span class="greekheb">τηρεῖν</span> here, in its distinction from <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν</span>, that merely “attention <span class="ital">to</span> the commandments” is to be understood by it; it rather includes in itself the actual obedience. This obedience is not here regarded as the means of the knowledge of God, but as the proof of it; rightly Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῶν ἔργων ἡ τελεία δεδείκνυται ἀγάπη</span>; only he should have said “<span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span>” instead of <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπη</span>. Between both of those there is the same relationship as between fellowship with God and walking in light; for as the former is related to the knowledge of God, so is the latter related to the observance of the divine commandments, which is the concrete embodiment of <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ φωτὶ περιπατεῖν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[90] The reason brought forward by Ebrard: “it lies also in the idea of the <span class="ital">commandments</span>, that they are mentioned as commandments of the Father and not of the Son,” is not valid; comp. Gospel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-15.htm" title="If you love me, keep my commandments.">John 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm" title="He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.">John 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-10.htm" title="If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.">John 15:10</a>. Ebrard, on the other hand, rightly points to ver. 6, where <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνος</span> (Christ) is distinguished from <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span>. From this verse it also follows that John, in this section, is considering Christ not as having given commandments, but as having walked according to the commandments of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[91] Lorinus: cognoscere cum quadam voluntatis propendentis approbatione.—A Lapide: cognitione non tantum speculativa, sed et practica, quae cum amore et affectu conjuncta est, ac in opus derivatur.—Spener: “This is not a mere knowing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.

The Proof of our Interest in Christ’s Propitiation and Advocacy. “And herein we get to know that we know Him—if we observe His commandments. He that saith ‘I know Him,’ and observeth not His commandments, is a liar, and in this man the Truth is not; but whosoever observeth His Word, truly in this man the love of God hath been carried to its end. Herein we get to know that we are in Him; he that saith he abideth in Him is bound, even as the Lord (<span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνος</span>) walked, himself also so to walk.” The Apostle foresees a question which may be raised: “How can I be assured that Christ is all this to <span class="ital">me—my</span> Propitiation, <span class="ital">my</span> Advocate? And how can I be assured that I have an abiding interest in Him?” He answers: (1) We attain to personal and conscious acquaintance with Christ by observance of His commandments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments....">1 John 2:3-5</a><span class="ital"> a</span>); (2) we attain to assurance of abiding union with Him by “walking even as He walked” (5<span class="ital">b</span>, 6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">hereby we do know that we know Him</span>] Or, <span class="bld">herein</span> <span class="ital">we</span> <span class="bld">come to know</span> <span class="ital">that we know Him</span>: in the Greek we have the present and perfect of the verb which means ‘to come to know, perceive, recognise’ (<span class="greekheb">γινώσκειν</span>); the perfect of which, ‘I have come to know’ = ‘I know.’ Comp. the Collect for the First Sunday after Epiphany; ‘that they may both <span class="ital">perceive and know</span> what things they ought to do.’ Progressive knowledge gained by experience is implied. ‘Herein’ followed by ‘if’, or ‘that’, or ‘because’, or ‘when, is a frequent construction in S.

There is no real knowledge of God, no fellowship with Him, without practical conformity to His will. <span class="ital">Nam quisquis eum non amat, profecto ostendit, quia quam sit amabilis, non novit</span> (Bede). S. John is again condemning that Gnostic doctrine which made excellence to consist in mere intellectual enlightenment. Divorced from holiness of life, says S. John, no enlightenment can be a knowledge of God. In his system of Christian Ethics the Apostle insists no less than Aristotle, that in morals knowledge without practice is worthless: ‘not speculation but conduct’ is the aim of both the Christian and the heathen philosopher. Mere knowledge will not do: nor will knowledge ‘touched by emotion’ do. It is possible to know, and admire, and in a sort of way love, and yet act as if we had not known. But S. John gives no encouragement to devotion without a moral <span class="ital">life</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>). There is only one way of proving to ourselves that we know God, and that is by loving obedience to His will. Compare the very high standard of virtue set by Aristotle: he only is a virtuous man who does virtuous acts, “first, knowingly; secondly, from deliberate preference, and deliberate preference for the sake of the acts (and not any advantages resulting from them); and thirdly, with firm and unvarying purpose” (<span class="ital">Nic.
