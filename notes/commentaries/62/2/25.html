What value should we put upon gospel truth! Thereby the promise of eternal life is made sure. The promise God makes, is suitable to his own greatness, power, and goodness; it is eternal life. The Spirit of truth will not lie; and he teaches all things in the present dispensation, all things necessary to our knowledge of God in Christ, and their glory in the gospel. The apostle repeats the kind words, little children; which denotes his affection. He would persuade by love. Gospel privileges oblige to gospel duties; and those anointed by the Lord Jesus abide with him. The new spiritual nature is from the Lord Christ. He that is constant to the practice of religion in trying times, shows that he is born from above, from the Lord Christ. Then, let us beware of holding the truth in unrighteousness, remembering that those only are born of God, who bear his holy image, and walk in his most righteous ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life - This is evidently added to encourage them in adhering to the truths which they had embraced respecting the Son of God. In maintaining these truths they had the promise of eternal life; in departing from them they had none, for the "promise" of heaven in our world is made only to those who embrace one class of doctrines or opinions. No one can show that any "promise" of heaven is made to the mere possessor of beauty, or wealth, or talent; to the accomplished or the "happy"; to those who are distinguished for science, or skill in the arts; to rank, or birth, or blood; to courage or strength. Whatever expectation of heaven anyone may entertain on account of any of these things, must be traced to something else than a "promise," for there is none in the Bible to that effect. The "promise" of heaven to people is limited to those who repent of their sins, who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and who lead a holy life; and if anyone will base his hope of heaven on a "promise," it must be limited to these things. And yet what well-founded hope of heaven "can" there be, except that which is based "on a promise?" How does anyone know that he can be saved, unless he has some assurance from God that it may and shall be so? Is not heaven his home? How does anyone know that he may dwell there, without some assurance from Him that he may? Is not the crown of life His gift? How can anyone know that he will possess it, unless he has some promise from Him? However people may reason, or conjecture, or hope, the only "promise" of eternal life is found in the Bible; and the fact that we have such promise should surely be a sufficient inducement to us to hold fast the truth. On the promise of life in the gospel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. this is the promise&#8212;Eternal life shall be the permanent consummation of thus abiding in the Son and in the Father (1Jo 2:24).<p>he&#8212;Greek, "Himself," Christ, "the Son" (compare 1Jo 1:1).<p>promised&#8212;(Joh 3:15, 36; 6:40, 47, 57; 17:2, 3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Which perseverance they are highly encouraged to by the promise of so great a thing as eternal life at length. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_john/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And this is the promise that he hath promised us,....

In the first case the meaning is: and this remaining is what He has promised, namely, eternal life. Gagnejus: “Manere in filio et patre promissio est, quam nobis pollicitus est orans pro nobis patrem Dominus <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-20.htm" title="Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;">John 17:20</a>. Bene ergo ait de hoc Johannes: haec est promissio, quam pollicitus est nobis, quae quidem est vita aeterna; vita enim aeterna est manere in Deo eoque frui hic per gratiam, in futuro per gloriam;” <span class="greekheb">τὴν ζωὴν τὴν αἰώνιον</span> then forms an apposition, by which that very remaining is described as happiness; this view in Oecumenius, and among modern commentators in Sander, Besser, Weiss. In the second case the thought is: “and eternal life is the promise which He has given us;” taking this view, a new thought, it is true, enters with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-25.htm" title="And this is the promise that he has promised us, even eternal life.">1 John 2:25</a>, and it requires something to be supplied to connect it with the preceding, perhaps what a Lapide gives: si in ipso maneamus (Spener: that is the promise if we remain in the Word, and consequently in the Father and the Son); but nevertheless it is, in accordance with the analogy of John’s mode of expression, to be preferred; comp. chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-14.htm" title="And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:">1 John 5:14</a>; similarly also chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1 John 3:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-11.htm" title="And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.">1 John 5:11</a>; in the last two passages the connection with what precedes appears clearly enough by both being connected with the same idea, whereas here there is no previous mention of the <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελία</span>; but even here the connection is not to be mistaken, because the <span class="greekheb">ζωὴ αἰώνιος</span> is directly connected with the <span class="greekheb">μένειν ἐν τῷ υἱῷ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

This view is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1 John 3:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-11.htm" title="And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.">1 John 5:11</a>. The connexion with what precedes is close, ‘eternal life’ being only another view of ‘abiding in the Father and the Son’. The ‘He’ is emphatic, and perhaps ‘He Himself would not be too strong as a rendering. Of course Christ is meant, “who in this whole passage forms the centre round which all the statements of the Apostle move” (Huther). For the promise see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-15.htm" title="That whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.">John 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm" title="But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.">John 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm" title="And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:40</a>, &c. &c.
