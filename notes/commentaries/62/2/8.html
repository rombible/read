And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Again, a new commandment I write unto you - "And yet, that which I write to you, and particularly enjoin on you, deserves in another sense to be called a new commandment, though it has been also inculcated from the beginning, for it was called new by the Saviour himself." Or the meaning may be, "In addition to the general precepts which I have referred to, I do now call your attention to the new commandment of the Saviour, that which he himself called new." There can be no doubt here that John refers to the commandment to "love one another," (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-9.htm">1 John 2:9-11</a>), and that it is here called new, not in the sense that John inculcated it as a novel doctrine, but in the sense that the Saviour called it such. For the reasons why it was so called by him, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>.<p>Which thing is true in him - In the Lord Jesus. That is, which commandment or law of love was illustrated in him, or was manifested by him in his contact with his disciples. That which was most prominent in him was this very love which he enjoined on all his followers.<p>And in you - Among you. That is, you have manifested it in your contact with each other. It is not new in the sense that you have never heard of it, and have never evinced it, but in the sense only that he called it new.<p>Because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth - The ancient systems of error, under which people hated each other, have passed away, and you are brought into the light of the true religion. Once you were in darkness, like others; now the light of the pure gospel shines around you, and that requires, as its distinguishing characteristic, love. Religion is often represented as light; and Christ spoke of himself, and was spoken of, as the Light of the world. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4-5</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35-36</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-46.htm">John 12:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. a new commandment&#8212;It was "old," in that Christians as such had heard it from the first; but "new" (Greek, "kaine," not "nea": new and different from the old legal precept) in that it was first clearly promulgated with Christianity; though the inner spirit of the law was love even to enemies, yet it was enveloped in some bitter precepts which caused it to be temporarily almost unrecognized, till the Gospel came. Christianity first put love to brethren on the new and highest MOTIVE, instinctive love to Him who first loved us, constraining us to love all, even enemies, thereby walking in the steps of Him who loved us when enemies. So Jesus calls it "new," Joh 13:34, 35, "Love one another as I have loved you" (the new motive); Joh 15:12.<p>which thing is true in him and in you&#8212;"In Christ all things are always true, and were so from the beginning; but in Christ and in us conjointly the commandment [the love of brethren] is then true when we acknowledge the truth which is in Him, and have the same flourishing in us" [Bengel]. Alford explains, "Which thing (the fact that the commandment is a new one) is true in Him and in you because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is now shining; that is, the commandment is a new one, and this is true both in the case of Christ and in the case of you; because in you the darkness is passing away, and in Him the true light is shining; therefore, on both accounts, the command is a new one: new as regards you, because you are newly come from darkness into light; new as regards Him, because He uttered it when He came into the world to lighten every man, and began that shining which even now continues." I prefer, as Bengel, to explain, The new commandment finds its truth in its practical realization in the walk of Christians in union with Christ. Compare the use of "verily," 1Jo 2:5. Joh 4:42, "indeed"; Joh 6:55. The repetition of "in" before "you," "in Him and in you," not "in Him and you" implies that the love commandment finds its realization separately: first it did so "in Him," and then it does so "in us," in so far as we now "also walk even as He walked"; and yet it finds its realization also conjointly, by the two being united in one sentence, even as it is by virtue of the love commandment having been first fulfilled in Him, that it is also now fulfilled in us, through His Spirit in us: compare a similar case, Joh 20:17, "My Father and your Father"; by virtue of His being "My Father," He is also your Father.<p>darkness is past&#8212;rather, as in 1Jo 2:17, "is passing away." It shall not be wholly "past" until "the Sun of righteousness" shall arise visibly; "the light is now shining" already, though but partially until the day bursts forth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Yet also he calls it <span class="ital">a new commandment, </span> as our Saviour did, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a></span>, upon the subjoined accounts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which thing is true; </span> i.e. evident, or verified, fulfilled, exemplified. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In him; </span> viz. in that new and high demonstration he had given of the sincerity and greatness of his own love, laying down his life for us, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-13.htm" title="Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.">John 15:13</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And in you; </span> or, us, (as some read), i.e. the mind of God herein is by a new and fresh light most evidently and gloriously signified in or among you, (the subject being here collective and plural, admits this varied and very usual sense of the particle <span class="ital">in</span>), inasmuch as <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the darkness is past; </span> i.e. the heathenish ignorance that made the world barbarous; a darkness in which the furious lusts and passions of men are wont to rage, turning this earth into another hell, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-20.htm" title="Have respect to the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.">Psalm 74:20</a></span>, is in a great measure vanished; and also the dark umbrage of the Judaic dispensation, (some read skia for skotia, not <span class="ital">darkness, </span> but <span class="ital">shadow</span>), in which the love of God to men was more obscurely represented, is past away and gone, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and the true light now shineth; </span> the love and grace of God towards sinners (the pattern and argument of our mutual love to one another) shines with <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">true light, </span> that is evident, in opposition to darkness, or immediately substantial, in opposition to type or shadow, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>,14,17</span>: representing the gracious design of God, and his very nature, who <span class="ital">is love, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-8.htm" title="He that loves not knows not God; for God is love.">1Jo 4:8</a>,16</span>, with so bright and glorious beams as ought to transform us into his likeness; and which therefore render the mutual hatred of one another the most incongruous thing to us in the world.

Which is the same with the former, considered in different respects. The command of brotherly love is a new one; that is, it is an excellent one, as a new name is an excellent name, and a new song is an excellent one; it is renewed by Christ under the Gospel dispensation; it is newly explained by him, and purged from the false glosses of the Scribes and Pharisees; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-43.htm">Matthew 5:43</a>; and enforced by him with a new argument, and by a new example of his own, even his own love to his people; and which is observed by them in a new manner, they being made new creatures; and this law being anew written in their hearts, under the renewing work of the Spirit of God, as a branch of the new covenant of grace; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>. The Jews (c) expect , "a new law" to be given them by the bands of the Messiah; and a new one he has given, even the new commandment of love, and which is the fulfilling of the law. <p>Which things is true in him, and in you. The Alexandrian copy reads, "in us"; the sense is either, it is true "in itself", as the phrase will bear to be rendered, and it is verified in you, or in us, to be a new commandment; or it is true in Christ, it is yea and amen in him; it has its full completion in him, who is the fulfilling end of the law, as well as it has been faithfully delivered, truly explained, and warmly and affectionately recommended and urged by him; and he is the great pattern and exemplar of it: and the love which this new commandment requires is really and truly in the saints, implanted in them in regeneration, is a fruit of the Spirit, and which faith works by, and will always continue in them; and should be in its actings like Christ's, true, sincere, cordial, affectionate, constant, and universal: and some think the word  or  "is", or "let it be", is wanting in the last clause, and may be read, "which thing is true in him, and is", or "let it be in you": that is, as love to the brethren is true and sincere in Christ, so it is, or should be in you; it should be without dissimulation, and so it was, as the reason following shows: <p>because the darkness is past, or is "passing"; meaning either the darkness of the ceremonial law, which lay in dark types and shadows, and in cloudy sacrifices, and mystical representations of things, and was a shadow of good things to come; and its shadows were now fleeing away apace, in fact as well as in right; and so the Alexandrian copy reads, "because the shadow is passing away"; the night of Jewish darkness was far spent, and the Gospel day was not only broke, but it was, or near noonday, which brought the light of faith, and the heat of love with it: or else the darkness of sin and ignorance, of a state of nature, and of the kingdom of Satan, in which the people of God are before conversion; which then passes away gradually, by little and little, for it is not removed at once, or wholly gone; for though the saints are at once removed out of a state of darkness, and from the kingdom of darkness, and the power of it, yet they are not wholly free from the darkness of sin and ignorance, they still see but through a glass darkly: and the words are better rendered, the darkness passes", or "is passing away", and not is past", or "has passed away"; for as yet it is not entirely gone; <p>and the true light now shineth; either the Gospel, which is a light, and a true and substantial one, in distinction from the dim light of nature, or the shadowy law of Moses; and which now, under the present dispensation, shines out in a most glorious manner, as the sun in its full strength; and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "the light of truth"; the word of truth, the Gospel of our salvation: or Jesus Christ, who is so called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>; in distinction from typical lights, as the "Urim" on the high priest's breastplate, the candlestick in the tabernacle and temple, and the pillar of fire by night, which guided the Israelites through the wilderness; and in opposition to all false lights, to the Scribes and Pharisees, to false Christs and false prophets, which are so many "ignes fatui"; but Christ is the sun of righteousness that is risen in our "horizon", and the true light which shines out in a most illustrious manner: or the light of grace is here intended, that light which the Spirit of God illuminates with in conversion; in which a man sees sin in its true colours, and has a spiritual and saving sight of Christ, of pardon, peace, life, righteousness, and salvation by him; which is no other than the light of faith, by which an enlightened person sees the Son, looks to him, and has an evidence of the unseen glories of another world. Now this is a true light, things are seen by the believer in a right light, both his own sins, and the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ; this is a shining one, which cannot but be observed by himself, and shines more and more to the perfect day; and it now shines as it did not before, in a state of nature, and continues to shine, and ever will: this light will never be put out, and is the cause of brotherly love, being truly in the saints, and of the continuance of it; before this light shines, men live in malice, but when it comes and shines, as they walk in light, they walk in love. <p>(c) Yalkut Simconi, par. 2. fol. 461. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Again, a new commandment I write unto you, <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.</span><p>(7) He adds that the doctrine indeed is old, but it is in a way new, both in respect to Christ, and also to us: in whom he through the gospel, engraves his law effectually, not in tables of stone, but in our minds. <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> Which thing (that is, that the doctrine is new which I write to you) is true in him, and in you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_john/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-8.htm" title="Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.">1 John 2:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">πάλιν ἐντολὴν καινὴν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Almost all commentators hold that the <span class="greekheb">ἐντολὴ καινή</span> is the same <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> as was the subject of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning.

The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.">1 John 2:7</a>) word of God;” most recently it has been accepted by Braune with the interpretation here given. The sense accordingly is: that which is already true, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> fulfilled, in Christ and in you, namely, the <span class="greekheb">τηρεῖν τὰς ἐντολὰς τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-10.htm" title="If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.">John 15:10</a>, where Christ says of Himself: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓῺ ΤᾺς ἘΝΤΟΛᾺς ΤΟῦ ΠΑΤΡΌς ΜΟΥ ΤΕΤΉΡΗΚΑ</span></span></span>), I write unto you as a new commandment.[111] With this view it is self-evident that the apostle calls the old commandment a <span class="ital">new</span> one only in so far as he writes it anew to them. It is true a different reference has usually been given to <span class="greekheb">καινή</span>, by understanding it either of the constant endurance of the commandment of love (Calvin: novum dieit, quod Deus quotidie suggerendo veluti renovat; Joannes negat ejusmodi esse doctrinam de fratribus diligendis, quae tempore obsolescat: sed perpetuo vigere), or to indicate that this commandment first entered into the world along with Christianity—whether emphasis was put more upon the substance of it (Lücke, de Wette, ed. 1 of this comm.), or upon the mere time of it (Düsterdieck);[112] but these constructions, not being indicated in the context, are purely forced.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>, Erasmus says: et contrarietatem declarat et iterationem; hic autem non repetitionis sed contrarietatis est declaratio; with this interpretation almost all commentators agree, referring <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> to the idea <span class="greekheb">ἐντ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καινήν</span>; but an antithetical construction is foreign to the word; it is = “again, once more,” is to be connected with <span class="greekheb">γράφω</span>, and is explained by the fact that the readers have already heard the commandment, nay, even are already fulfilling it. Lücke and de Wette connect it directly with the verb, but in such a way that even they give to it an antithetical reference.[113]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐστὶν ἀληθές</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἀληθής</span> signifies here the actual reality, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-9.htm" title="And he went out, and followed him; and knew not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.">Acts 12:9</a> (see Meyer on this passage).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἘΝ</span></span></span> is to be retained in its special meaning, not = “respectu, in reference to,” nor is it used “of the subject <span class="ital">in which</span> something true is to be recognized as true (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1 John 2:3</a>)” (de Wette), for there is no mention here of any knowledge. That by <span class="greekheb">αὐτό<span class="bld"><span class="ital">ς</span></span></span> here not God (Jachmann), but Christ is to be understood, is shown by the context.

The contrasted words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΣΚΟΤΊΑ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ Φῶς ΤῸ ἈΛΗΘΙΝΌΝ</span></span></span> are to be taken in ethical sense (Braune);[115] the former idea signifies the darkness which consists in error and sin, as it exists outside the fellowship with God; the latter, the light which consists in truth and holiness, as it proceeds from Christ, who Himself is the true light. It is incorrect to understand here by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ Φῶς ΤῸ ἈΛ</span></span></span>., Christ Himself (Bengel, Erdmann), as the contrast with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΣΚΟΤΊΑ</span></span></span> shows. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΗΘΙΝΌς</span></span></span> is an expression which is almost confined to the writings of John; outside them it is only found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-11.htm" title="If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?">Luke 16:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>, and three times in the Epistle to the Hebrews; it describes the light of which the apostle is speaking as the eternal, essential light, of which the earthly light is merely the transitory reflection; see especially Neander on this passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΆΓΕΤΑΙ</span></span></span> is translated by the Vulgate as perfect: quoniam tenebrae transierunt; similarly by Luther: “the darkness is past;” and Calvin directly says: Praesens tempus loco Praeteriti. This, however, is arbitrary; the present is to be retained as such; it is used in the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-31.htm" title="And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away.">1 Corinthians 7:31</a> : <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΆΓΕΙ</span></span></span> (see Meyer on this passage), so that we must interpret: “<span class="ital">the</span> <span class="greekheb">σκοτία</span> <span class="ital">is in the state of passing away.</span>” It is unnecessary to take <span class="greekheb">παράγεται</span>, with Bengel, with whom Sander and Besser agree, as passive (Bengel: non dicit <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΆΓΕΙ</span></span></span> transit, sed <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΆΓΕΤΑΙ</span></span></span> traducitur, commutatur, ita ut tandem absorbeatur); it is more natural to regard it as the middle form with intransitive meaning. With the meaning: “is in the state of passing,” corresponds the particle <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἬΔΗ</span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΑΊΝΕΙ</span></span></span>, which is not = “now” (Luther), but by which the moment is described in which the darkness is retreating before the light, at which therefore neither has the darkness already completely disappeared, nor is the light completely dominant. Most of the commentators, both the older and more recent (Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette-Brückner, Lücke, Sander, Düsterdieck, Erdmann, Ebrard), take this as referring to Christianity in general, in so far as by it, as the true light, the old darkness is being ever more and more overcome; but by the word <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἬΔΗ</span></span></span> the apostle shows that in these words he is looking forward to a future time at which that victory will have been completely won, and which he regards as close at hand (so also Braune). The moment in which he writes this is in his eyes, therefore, no other than that which immediately precedes the second coming of Christ, and which He Himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a> calls the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΣΧΆΤΗ ὭΡΑ</span></span></span>,[116] in which it is of the greater importance for Christians, by keeping the commandment, to show themselves as children of the light. The same train of thought essentially occurs here as afterwards in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-15.htm" title="Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him....">1 John 2:15-18</a>; compare also the Pauline <span class="greekheb">ἡ νὺξ προέκοψεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ ἡμέρα ἤγγικε</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-12.htm" title="The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.">Romans 13:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[107] The same view is found in Castellio, Socinus, and Bengel. The latter remarks on <span class="greekheb">ἐντολὴν καινήν</span>: praeceptum novum, quod nobis nunc primum in hac epistola scribitur; and on <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>: quod hoc est illud praeceptum, to which he then very strangely adds: amor fratris, ex luce.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[108] Ebrard says: “The eternally existing light is one which has already appeared <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, in so far as in Christ the light objectivized has arisen for the world and has overcome the darkness, and <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> in so far as also subjectively to the readers the light of the gospel has arisen, and they also subjectively have been drawn from darkness unto light.” By <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> he means, therefore, the readers, in whom, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> in whose souls, the transition from darkness to light has taken place; by <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, however, not Christ, in whom, but the world, for which that has happened objectively, inasmuch as Christ entered as the light into the darkness of the world. Quite a different meaning, therefore, is here assigned to <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> from that which is given to <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>, as the difference in the relation from the antithesis of “objective” and “subjective” clearly shows.—It is not merely the change of the present <span class="greekheb">παράγεται</span> into the perfect that is the cause of this treatment, for it appears elsewhere in the commentary,—thus on p. 148: “that which is true in Christ and in you, that the darkness <span class="ital">is past</span>,” etc.; p. 150: “similar to the new announcement, that the darkness is past,” etc.; p. 155: “It is the truth, that the darkness <span class="ital">is past</span>;” against which, on the other hand, <span class="greekheb">παράγεται</span> is correctly explained on p. 150: “the darkness is passing by, is in a state of passing away, of disappearing.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[109] For if <span class="greekheb">ὅ ἐστιν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is, according to the intention of the apostle, to be referred to the idea of the newness of the commandment, he would—first, have given this idea a more independent form than he has given it as a simple attribute of the object <span class="greekheb">ἐντολήν</span> depending on <span class="greekheb">γράφω</span>; and, secondly, not have given the confirmation of the statement (that the commandment is a <span class="ital">new</span> one) in a sentence which does not so much show the truth of this idea as merely state the sphere in which that statement is true; to which may be added, that the idea so resulting is itself so indistinct, that it requires, in order to be understood, an explanatory circumlocution, such as: “that the commandment is a new one has its truth in Christ, inasmuch as it did not exist before Him,” etc. (ed. 1 of this comm.). Besides, an emphasis unwarranted by the context is placed on the idea of the newness of the commandment, especially if it is thought that the following <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> again serves to establish the thought expressed in the confirmatory clause (Lücke, de Wette, Brückner).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[110] Düsterdieck, it is true, approves of Knapp’s paraphrase, which agrees with the above explanation: <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἐντολὴν καιν</span>. <span class="greekheb">γρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν τοῦτο ὅ ἐστιν ἀληθές κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; but, with the idea of a constructio ad sensum, refers <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> to the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἐντολήν</span>, so that this forms the object of <span class="greekheb">γράφω</span>, which by the relative clause obtains its more particular definition. In opposition to this construction, de Wette has rightly observed that it has grammatical difficulty. When Düsterdieck, in reply to Lücke’s objection, that with that interpretation it would need to run <span class="greekheb">ἥ ἐστιν ἀληθής</span>, says that it is not the <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> itself as such, but its substance in Christ, etc., that has been fulfilled, Ebrard’s observation is a sufficient answer: “That which is required in the <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> is nothing else than just the <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span> itself; the requirement itself is fulfilled in Christ when its substance is fulfilled in Him.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[111] That John places before his readers anew as a commandment that which already has been fulfilled in them, is clearly not more strange than that he declares to them truths of which he himself says that they know them already (comp. ver. 21). Brückner admits that the construction here advocated is simple and clear, but groundlessly thinks that “the strangeness of this form of speech” is not mitigated by the reference to ver. 21.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[112] On the basis of the right view of <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς</span>, ver. 7, we find the nature of the newness of the commandment indicated just in this; this, however, is only the case if the temporal reference is retained in its purity. This Düsterdieck indeed insists on; but this relation has only force if we regard at the same time the substance of the commandment, as Düsterdieck does. But nothing in the context indicates this <span class="ital">new</span> substance, and it is therefore very differently defined by the commentators.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[113] Lücke does so when he says: “In ver. 8, John continues <span class="ital">correctingly</span> thus: Again a new commandment I write unto you.” (In the edition of 1851, Lücke agrees with the usual acceptation: “Again—in contrast—a new commandment I write unto you;” see ed. 3, p. 249, note 1.)—De Wette does not expressly give his opinion about <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>; but when he thinks that John should properly have written: “again a new commandment I call it,” and when he then paraphrases it: “The commandment of love is an old and long-known one to you; <span class="ital">but</span> (as it is altogether revealed as a new one by Christ) for you who partake in the newness of life it is in an especial manner a new one,” the antithetical reference is clearly brought out by him also.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[114] With this connection of the thoughts, the double-membered clause: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἡ σκοτία</span> … <span class="greekheb">φαίνει</span>, must confirm both <span class="greekheb">ἐστιν ἀλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> and also <span class="greekheb">ἐστιν ἀλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>. Now, when Lücke makes the apostle to say, as a proof that the commandment to walk in light shows itself in Christ and in his readers as a <span class="ital">new</span> one: “Not only in Christ Himself (<span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>) has the true light appeared, but it has also shed itself abroad, dispelling the darkness in the minds of his readers (<span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>), and is shining in them,” he attributes the thought really expressed by the apostle (<span class="greekheb">ἡ σκοτία</span> … <span class="greekheb">φαίνει</span>) <span class="ital">only</span> to <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>; while to <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, on the other hand, he attributes an idea which the apostle has <span class="ital">not</span> expressed.—Brückner says: “The <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> refers to <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ φῶς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> rather to <span class="greekheb">ἡ σκοτία κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.;” but this reference of the one member of the confirmatory clause to the one element of the thought to be confirmed must be regarded as unjustified, although Brückner thinks “it can easily be imagined that the apostle in the one part of the confirmation had in view rather the latter, and in the other rather the former part of the clause to be confirmed,” for such a different reference is in no way hinted at; besides, <span class="greekheb">ἤδη</span> is here altogether left out of view. Düsterdieck rightly establishes the proposition that the <span class="ital">whole</span> sentence: <span class="greekheb">ἀληθ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, is to be regarded as confirmed by the <span class="ital">whole</span> sentence: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἡ σκ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">φαίνει</span>; but when he then, in interpretation, says: “Already the darkness is dispelled by the true light, which shines in truth <span class="ital">in Christ</span> and <span class="ital">in His believers</span> (in so far, namely, as brotherly love attained its most perfect manifestation in the walk of Christ, and is exercised by believers also),” it is only the <span class="ital">second</span> part of the confirmatory clause that is referred by him to <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν</span>, but not the first part; and this indeed is quite natural, since <span class="ital">in Christ</span> a disappearance of darkness is not imaginable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[115] It was to be expected that Weiss here also denies to the ideas <span class="greekheb">σκοτία</span> and <span class="greekheb">φῶς</span> the ethical meaning, and wants to be understood by the former only error, by the latter only the knowledge of God. Weiss himself, however, views them both so that they are of ethical—and not merely theoretical—character; and, moreover, as he admits that with the former error sin, and with the latter knowledge holiness, is necessarily connected, it is so much the more arbitrary to allege that John, in the use of these ideas, utterly ignored this necessary connection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[116] Rickli: “John says this of the <span class="ital">time</span> in which they are living, and in which the great work of the Lord had had a wonderful, rapid progress of development. The true Light, the Lord in His perfect manifestation of divine truth, is already <span class="ital">shining;</span> … already the great morning is dawning for mankind. When the Lord shall return, then shall be the perfect day of God. Towards this manifestation all believers walk.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-8.htm" title="Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.">1 John 2:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>, “again,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> in another sense, from another point of view, not in itself but in our recognition of it, “it is a new commandment”. <span class="greekheb">ὅ ἐστιν ἀληθές</span>, in apposition to <span class="greekheb">ἐντολήν</span>—“a thing which is true,” <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the paramount necessity of Love. This truth, though unperceived, is contained in the revelation of Jesus Christ (<span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>) and proved in the experience of believers (<span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>). It is a fact that hatred of one’s brother clouds the soul and shuts out the light. “I know this,” says the Apostle, “because the darkness is passing away and the light, the true light, is already shining,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> my eyes are getting accustomed to the light of the Gospel-revelation, and I have seen this truth which at first was hidden from me.

It is difficult to decide between these three renderings; but the third is simpler than the first. Both Tyndale and the Genevan Version have ‘a thing that is true’. If we adopt the rendering of A. V. and R. V., the meaning seems to be, that <span class="ital">the newness of the commandment is</span> true, both in the case of Christ, who promulgated it afresh, and in the case of you, who received it afresh. If we prefer the simpler rendering, the meaning will be, that what has already been shewn to be true by the pattern life of Christ and by the efforts of Christians to imitate it, is now given by S. John as a new commandment. The ‘Again’ introduces a new view: that which from one point of view was an old commandment, from another was a new one. It was old, but not obsolete, ancient but not antiquated: it had been renewed in a fuller sense; it had received a fresh sanction. Thus both those who feared innovations and those who disliked what was stale might feel satisfied.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Him and in you</span>] Note the double preposition, implying that it is true in the case of Christ in a different sense from that in which it is true in the case of Christians. He reissued the commandment and was the living embodiment and example of it; they accepted it and endeavoured to follow it: both illustrated its truth and soundness. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a>, where ‘with’ is repeated, and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>, where ‘to’ is repeated.

All earlier English Versions are wrong here, from Wiclif onwards, misled by <span class="ital">transierunt tenebrae</span> in the Vulgate. On ‘darkness’ see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a>. The ‘because’ introduces the reason why he writes as a new commandment what has been proved true by the example of Christ and their own experience. The ideal state of things, to which the perfect fulfilment of this commandment belongs, has already begun: ‘The darkness is on the wane, the true light is shewing its power; <span class="ital">therefore</span> I bid you to walk as children of light’. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-5.htm" title="You are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.">1 Thessalonians 5:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the true light now shineth</span>] Or, <span class="bld">the light, the true (light), is already shining</span> or, <span class="ital">giving light:</span> the article is repeated, as in the case of ‘the life, the eternal (life)’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>, and ‘the commandment, the old (commandment)’ in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning.

Here we have not precisely the same word for ‘true’ as in the previous sentence. In ‘a thing which is true’ (<span class="greekheb">ἀληθές</span>) ‘true’ is opposed to ‘lying’: here ‘true’ (<span class="greekheb">ἀληθινὸν</span>) is opposed to ‘spurious’, and is just the old English ‘very’. In ‘Very God of very God’ in the Nicene Creed, ‘very’ represents the word here rendered ‘true’. ‘True’ in this sense means ‘genuine’, or ‘that which realises the idea formed of it’, and hence ‘perfect.’ Christ and the Gospel are ‘the perfect light’ in opposition to the imperfect light of the Law and the Prophets and the false light of Gnostic philosophy. This form of the word ‘true’ is almost peculiar to S. John: it occurs 4 times in this Epistle, 9 times in the Gospel and 10 times in the Apocalypse: elsewhere in the N.T. only 5 times. Christ in the Gospel is called ‘the perfect Vine’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm" title="I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.">John 15:1</a>), ‘the perfect Bread’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.">John 6:32</a>) and ‘the perfect Light’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>). It is comparatively unimportant whether we interpret ‘the perfect light’ here to mean Christ, or the light of the truth, or the kingdom of heaven: but <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a> will certainly incline us to the first of these interpretations. The contrast with the impersonal darkness does not disprove this here any more than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a>. Darkness is never personal; it is not an effluence from Satan as light is from God or from Christ. It is the result, not of the presence of the evil one, but of the absence of God.

This passage savours of the fulness of the Spirit in the apostle.—<span class="greekheb">ὃ ἐστιν ἀληθὲς</span>, <span class="ital">that which is truth</span>) <span class="ital">Truth</span>, substantively, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>, where <span class="ital">truth</span> and <span class="ital">a lie</span> are opposed to each other. Thence also <span class="greekheb">ὃ</span> is put for <span class="greekheb">ἣ</span>, that is, <span class="ital">the commandment</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span>). The sense is: <span class="ital">the commandment</span>, or <span class="ital">precept, is truth</span>; that is, the darkness truly passes away, etc. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.">1 John 2:7</a>, to the word <span class="ital">old</span>, so in this ver., to the word <span class="ital">new</span>, its definition is immediately subjoined, what is <span class="ital">the old</span>, and what is <span class="ital">the new</span>. The old is that which we had from the beginning: the new is that which is true in Jesus Christ and in us. The difference of time in the words, <span class="ital">ye had</span>, and <span class="ital">it is</span>, tends to this. In Christ all things are always true, and were so from that beginning; but in Christ and in us, conjointly, the precept is then truth, when we acknowledge the truth, which is in Him, and have the same flourishing in us. John praises the present state of those to whom he writes, as one even more highly favoured than that very state which they had had at the beginning of their hearing the Gospel, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/13-11.htm" title="And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed....">Romans 13:11-12</a>; whence also the old precept could with pleasantness be proposed to them under a new method.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτ</span> <span class="ital">because</span>. This is that precept, the love of a brother, from the light. Hence at the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-9.htm" title="He that said he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now.">1 John 2:9</a> <span class="ital">therefore</span> is to be understood. Comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all....">1 John 1:5-6</a>.—<span class="greekheb">παράγεται</span>) He does not say <span class="greekheb">παράγει</span>, <span class="ital">passes</span> by, but <span class="greekheb">παράγεται</span>, <span class="ital">is caused to pass</span>, is changed, so that at length it is absorbed. The same word is used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-17.htm" title="And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of God stays for ever.">1 John 2:17</a>, where it is opposed to <span class="ital">abiding</span>. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm" title="For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.">Ezra 9:2</a>, Septuagint, <span class="greekheb">παρήχθη σπέρμα τὸ ἅγιον</span>, <span class="ital">the holy seed was transferred</span>, or <span class="ital">caused to pass to the nations</span>, and was mingled with them. Herodian: <span class="greekheb">ὄνομα παραχθὲν</span>, <span class="ital">a name changed</span>, transferred from another, or to another.—Book I., ch. 16, and V. 7. The present is to be observed, as in <span class="ital">shineth</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ φῶς τὸ ἀληθινὸν</span>, <span class="ital">the true light</span>) Jesus Christ: <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἤδη</span>) <span class="ital">now</span>, with you; but it will shine the more for ever: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a>.

Old, because John's readers have had it from the beginning of their Christian experience. New, because, in the unfolding of Christian experience, it has developed new power, meaning, and obligation, and closer correspondence "with the facts of Christ's life, with the crowning mystery of His passion, and with the facts of the Christian life."<p>Which thing is true (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>The expression which thing, or that which, refers either to the commandment of love, or to the fact stated, viz., that the old commandment is new. The fact that the old commandment is new is true in Him and in us. On the whole I prefer this.<p>In Him and in us<p>For us, read you. The fact that the old commandment is new, is true in Him (Christ), since He gave it as a new commandment, and illustrated it by His word and example. It is true in you, since you did not receive it until Christ gave it, and since the person and life of Christ are appealing to you in new lights and with fresh power as your Christian life develops. In Him, points back to as He walked.<p>Because<p>Explaining the apparent paradox.<p>The darkness (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>. God is light; and whatever is not in fellowship with God is therefore darkness. In all cases where the word is not used of physical darkness, it means moral insensibility to the divine light; moral blindness or obtuseness.
