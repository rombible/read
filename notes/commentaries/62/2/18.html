And therefore the apostle here cautions them against such deceivers, intimating, at the same time, for their encouragement and comfort, that the power of their persecutors, the Jews, would speedily be broken. Doddridge, however, Wesley, and many others, by the <span class="ital">last hour, </span>or last time, here understand the last dispensation of grace. As if the apostle had said, “The last dispensation that God will ever give to the world is now promulgated, and it is no wonder if Satan endeavour, to the utmost, to adulterate a system from which his kingdom has so much to fear.” <span class="ital">And as ye have heard that antichrist shall come </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ερχκεται</span>, <span class="ital">cometh. </span>“The word <span class="greekheb">αντιχριστος</span>, <span class="ital">antichrist, </span>is nowhere found but in John’s first and second epistle. It may have two meanings. For if the preposition <span class="greekheb">αντι</span>, in <span class="greekheb">αντιχριστος</span>, denotes <span class="ital">in place of, </span>the name will signify one who puts himself in the place of Christ: consequently <span class="ital">antichrist </span>is a false Christ. But if the preposition denotes <span class="ital">oppositions, antichrist </span>is one who opposeth Christ. The persons to whom this epistle was written had heard of the coming of <span class="ital">antichrist </span>in both senses of the name. For the first sort of antichrists were foretold by our Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-5.htm" title="For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.">Matthew 24:5</a> : <span class="ital">Many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many. </span>The second sort were foretold <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-11.htm" title="And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.">Matthew 24:11</a>, <span class="ital">Many false prophets will arise and deceive many. </span>From what John hath written, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm" title="Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son.">1 John 2:22</a> of this chapter, and chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world....">1 John 4:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.">1 John 2:7</a>, there is reason to think that by <span class="ital">antichrist </span>he meant those false prophets, or teachers, who were foretold by our Lord to rise about the time of the destruction of Jerusalem, and who were now gone abroad. Some of these denied the humanity of Jesus Christ, others of them denied his divinity; and as both sorts opposed Christ, by denying the redemption of the world through his death, it is probably of them chiefly that John speaks in his epistles. When the apostle mentions these false teachers collectively, he calls them <span class="ital">the antichrist </span>in the singular number, as St. Paul called the false teachers collectively, of whom he prophesied, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>, <span class="ital">the man of sin. </span>But when John speaks of these teachers as individuals, he calls them <span class="ital">many antichrists, </span>in the plural number.” — Macknight. Thus also Mr. Wesley: “Under the term <span class="ital">antichrist, </span>or the spirit of antichrist, he includes all false teachers as enemies to the truth; yea, whatever doctrines or men are contrary to Christ. It seems to have been long after this that the name of antichrist was appropriated to that grand adversary of Christ, <span class="ital">the man of sin, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>.” <span class="ital">Even now are there many antichrists </span>— Many seducers revolted from Christianity, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm" title="They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.">1 John 2:19</a>,) who were actuated by an antichristian spirit, and do secretly undermine the interest of Christ, and so make way for the grand antichrist. The preterit tense, <span class="greekheb">γεγονασι</span>, is here used to signify, not only the existence of many antichrists at that time, but also that there had been many antichrists who had gone off the stage; <span class="ital">whereby we know that it is the last time </span>— The last hour of the Jewish state, namely, by Christ’s prediction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm" title="For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.">Matthew 24:24</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 Every man is an antichrist, who denies the Person, or any of the offices of Christ; and in denying the Son, he denies the Father also, and has no part in his favour while he rejects his great salvation. Let this prophecy that seducers would rise in the Christian world, keep us from being seduced. The church knows not well who are its true members, and who are not, but thus true Christians were proved, and rendered more watchful and humble. True Christians are anointed ones; their names expresses this: they are anointed with grace, with gifts and spiritual privileges, by the Holy Spirit of grace. The great and most hurtful lies that the father of lies spreads in the world, usually are falsehoods and errors relating to the person of Christ. The unction from the Holy One, alone can keep us from delusions. While we judge favourably of all who trust in Christ as the Divine Saviour, and obey his word, and seek to live in union with them, let us pity and pray for those who deny the Godhead of Christ, or his atonement, and the new-creating work of the Holy Ghost. Let us protest against such antichristian doctrine, and keep from them as much as we may.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Little children - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>.<p>It is the last time - The closing period or dispensation; that dispensation in which the affairs of the world are ultimately to be wound up. The apostle does not, however, say that the end of the world would soon occur, nor does he intimate how long this dispensation would be. That period might continue through many ages or centuries, and still be the last dispensation, or that in which the affairs of the world would be finally closed. See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a> note. Some have supposed that the "last time" here refers to the destruction of Jerusalem, and the end of the Jewish economy; but the more natural interpretation is to refer it to the last dispensation of the world, and to suppose that the apostle meant to say that there were clear evidences that that period had arrived.<p>And as ye have heard that antichrist shall come - The word "antichrist" occurs in the New Testament only in these Epistles of John, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm">1 John 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a>. The proper meaning of (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;  anti) in composition is:<p>(1) "over-against," as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  antitassein;<p>(2) "contrary to," as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  antilegein;<p>(3) reciprocity, as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;  antapodido&#772;mi;<p>(4) "substitution," as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;  antibasileus;<p>(5) the place of the king, or &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  anthupatos - "proconsul."<p>The word "antichrist," therefore, might denote anyone who either was or claimed to be in the place of Christ, or one who, for any cause, was in opposition to him. The word, further, would apply to one opposed to him, on whatever ground the opposition might be; whether it were open and avowed, or whether it were only in fact, as resulting from certain claims which were adverse to his, or which were inconsistent with his. A "vice-functionary," or an "opposing functionary," would be the idea which the word would naturally suggest. If the word stood alone, and there were nothing said further to explain its meaning, we should think, when the word "antichrist" was used, either of one who claimed to be the Christ, and who thus was a rival; or of one who stood in opposition to him on some other ground. That which constituted the characteristics of antichrist, according to John, who only has used the word, he has himself stated. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm">1 John 2:22</a>, "who is a liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son." <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>, "and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; and this is that spirit of antichrist." <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a>, "for many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist."<p>From this it is clear, that John understood by the word all those that denied that Jesus is the Messiah, or that the Messiah has come in the flesh. If they held that Jesus was a deceiver, and that he was not the Christ, or if they maintained that, though Christ had come, he had not come in the flesh, that is, with a proper human nature, this showed that such persons had the spirit of antichrist. They arrayed themselves against him, and held doctrines which were in fact in entire opposition to the Son of God. It would appear then that John does not use the word in the sense which it would bear as denoting one who set up a rival claim, or who came in the place of Christ, but in the sense of those who were opposed to him by denying essential doctrines in regard to his person and advent. It is not certainly known to what persons he refers, but it would seem not improbable to Jewish adversaries, (see Suicer's Thesaur. s. voc.,) or to some forms of the Gnostic belief. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2</a>. The doctrine respecting antichrist, as stated in the New Testament, may be summed up in the following particulars:<p>(1) That there would be those, perhaps in considerable numbers, who would openly claim to be the Christ, or the true Messiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>.<p>(2) that there would be a spirit, which would manifest itself early in the church, that would strongly tend to some great apostasy under some one head or leader, or to a concentration on an individual, or a succession of individuals, who would have eminently the spirit of antichrist, though for a time the developement of that spirit would be hindered or restrained. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1-7</a>.<p>(3) that this would be ultimately concentrated on a single leader - "the man of sin" - and embodied under some great apostasy, at the head of which would be that "man of sin," <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3-4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8-10</a>. It is to this that Paul particularly refers, or this is the view which he took of this apostacy, and it is this which he particularly describes.<p>(4) that, in the meantime, and before the elements of the great apostasy should be concentrated and embodied, there might not be a few who would partake of the same general spirit, and who would be equally opposed to Christ in their doctrines and aims; that is, who would embody in themselves the essential spirit of antichrist, and by whose appearing it might be known that the last dispensation had come. It is to these that John refers, and these he found in his own age. Paul fixed the eye on future times, when the spirit of antichrist should be embodied under a distinct and mighty organization; John on his own time, and found then essentially what it had been predicted would occur in the church. He here says that they had been taught to expect that antichrist would come under the last dispensation; and it is implied that it could be ascertained that it was the last time, from the fact that the predicted opposer of Christ had come. The reference is probably to the language of the Saviour, that before the end should be, and as a sign that it was coming, many would arise claiming to be Christ, and, of course, practically denying that he was the Christ. <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5</a>, "many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many." <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>, "and there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets; and they shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect." This prediction it is probable the apostles had referred to wherever they had preached, so that there was a general expectation that one or more persons would appear claiming to be the Christ, or maintaining such opinions as to be inconsistent with the true doctrine that Jesus was the Messiah. Such persons, John says, had then in fact appeared, by which it could be known that they were living under the closing dispensations of the world referred to by the Saviour.

Little children&#8212;same Greek as 1Jo 2:13; children in age. After the fathers and young men were gone, "the last time" with its "many Antichrists" was about to come suddenly on the children. "In this last hour we all even still live" [Bengel]. Each successive age has had in it some of the signs of "the last time" which precedes Christ's coming, in order to keep the Church in continual waiting for the Lord. The connection with 1Jo 2:15-17 is: There are coming those seducers who are of the world (1Jo 4:5), and would tempt you to go out from us (1Jo 2:19) and deny Christ (1Jo 2:22).<p>as ye have heard&#8212;from the apostles, preachers of the Gospel (for example, 2Th 2:3-10; and in the region of Ephesus, Ac 20:29, 30).<p>shall come&#8212;Greek, "cometh," namely, out of his own place. Antichrist is interpreted in two ways: a false Christ (Mt 24:5, 24), literally, "instead of Christ"; or an adversary of Christ, literally, "against Christ." As John never uses pseudo-Christ, or "false Christ," for Antichrist, it is plain he means an adversary of Christ, claiming to himself what belongs to Christ, and wishing to substitute himself for Christ as the supreme object of worship. He denies the Son, not merely, like the pope, acts in the name of the Son, 2Th 2:4, "Who opposeth himself (Greek, " ANTI-keimenos") [to] all that is called God," decides this. For God's great truth, "God is man," he would substitute his own lie, "man is God" [Trench].<p>are there&#8212;Greek, "there have begun to be"; there have arisen. These "many Antichrists" answer to "the spirit of lawlessness (Greek) doth already work." The Antichristian principle appeared then, as now, in evil men and evil teachings and writings; but still "THE Antichrist" means a hostile person, even as "THE Christ" is a personal Saviour. As "cometh" is used of Christ, so here of Antichrist, the embodiment in his own person of all the Antichristian features and spirit of those "many Antichrists" which have been, and are, his forerunners. John uses the singular of him. No other New Testament writer uses the term. He probably answers to "the little horn having the eyes of a man, and speaking great things" (Da 7:8, 20); "the man of sin, son of perdition" (2Th 2:3); "the beast ascending out of the bottomless pit" (Re 11:7; 17:8), or rather, "the false prophet," the same as "the second beast coming up out of the earth" (Re 13:11-18; 16:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The last time; </span> the time here referred to seems to be the destruction of Jerusalem, and the finishing of the Jewish state, both civil and ecclesiastical.

Or hour; not of the Jewish civil and church state, for that had been at an end for some time; this epistle was written some years after the destruction of Jerusalem; nor the last hour of the Gospel dispensation, or world to come, for this was but the first age of that; and much less the last hour of time, or of the present world itself, for that has been many hundreds of years since; but the last hour of the apostolic age. All the apostles were now dead, John was the last of them; perilous times were now coming on, impostors and heretics were rising apace, against which the apostle cautions his little children; and so still he writes to them, agreeably to their age and character, who, being such, were most likely to be imposed upon by those who lie in wait to deceive. <p>And as ye have heard that antichrist shall come; or "is coming"; and begins to show himself in the false teachers and deceivers, who were his forerunners; and this they had heard and understood, either from the words of Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; or from the account the Apostle Paul gave to the Thessalonians concerning him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; or rather it may be from what, the apostle had said to the elders of the church at Ephesus, where the Apostle John now was, when he met them at Miletus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>, <p>even now there are many antichrists. The Syriac and Ethiopic versions read, "false Christs"; but such are not intended here, that set up for Messiahs, whom Christ foretold should arise before the destruction of Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>; for that was now over, and those false Christs had arisen and were gone: if this sense could be admitted, Bar Cocab, in Adrian's time, bids fair to be the false Christ, or Messiah, in the preceding clause, as the same versions there read; but such as were adversaries of Christ, as the Arabic version renders it, are meant, who set themselves against Christ, and were opposers of his person, incarnation, and office; who either denied that he was the Christ, or that he was come in the flesh, the truth of his incarnation, or his proper deity, or real humanity, such as Ebion, Cerinthus, and others. The apostle might well say there were many, since in his time were the followers of Simon Magus, the Menandrians, Saturnilians, Basilidians, Nicolaites, Gnostics, Carpocratians, Cerinthians, Ebionites, and Nazarenes, as reckoned up by Epiphanius. And hence we learn, that antichrist is not one single individual, but many; antichrist in the former clause is explained by antichrists in this; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm">1 John 2:22</a>; and though the popes of Rome are, by way of eminence, the antichrist that should come, and which those deceivers were the forerunners of, and paved the way for; yet they are not the only antichrists, there were others before them, and there are many now besides them. <p>Whereby we know that it is the last time; the pure apostolic age was now going off, with the doctrines, discipline, and worship of it, which was easy to be discerned by the multitude of antichrists which now appeared; and it may well be thought to be the last time, or near the end of things with us, since almost every heresy is revived among us. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{16}</span> <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> Little children, <span class="cverse3">{17}</span> it is the last time: <span class="cverse3">{18}</span> and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.</span><p>(16) Now, he turns himself to little children, which nonetheless are well instructed in the sum of religion, and wills them by various reasons to shake off laziness, which is too familiar with that age.<p>(n) He uses this word Little not because he speaks to children, but to allure them the more by using such sweet words.<p>(17) First, because the last time is at hand, so that the matter suffers no delay.<p>(18) Secondly, because antichrists, that is, such as fall from God, are already come, even as they heard that they would come.

Lücke, Neander, Baumgarten-Crusius, Gerlach, Erdmann, Myrberg, Ebrard, etc., have therefore rightly interpreted the expression as a description of this time. The hesitation to admit that the apostle was mistaken in his expectation of the nearness of the advent, has given rise to many a false interpretation. Socinus and Grotius think that <span class="greekheb">ἐσχάτη ὥρα</span> is the time immediately preceding the destruction of Jerusalem<span class="ital">;</span> this view approximates to that of Düsterdieck, according to which the last time before the commencement of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΡΊΣΙς</span></span></span> is meant, which had its beginning at the destruction of Jerusalem. But the scruple is not overcome by this, for chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a> shows that John regarded the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span> of the Lord as near, and not as distant, just as the other apostles, and especially also Paul, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>, in view of which even Düsterdieck finds himself compelled to admit this; Besser urges the want of the article, and translates: “a last time,” i.e<span class="ital">.</span> the time before a special revelation of the judicial glory of Christ, in which the last hour before the universal final judgment is prefigured; but it is well known that the article is often wanting just with ideas which are definite in themselves; to which it may be added that the idea of such a succession of different epochs, which are to be regarded as special revelations of the judicial power of Christ, is nowhere found expressed in the N. T.[155] Oecumenius regarded it as likely that <span class="greekheb">ἐσχάτη</span> here is used = <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΕΙΡΊΣΤΗ</span></span></span>; this explanation is found in Schoettgen (tempora periculosa, pessima et abjectissima), Carpzov, and others (similarly Paulus: it is a late, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> dark, and ever growing worse, time); whereas the distinction between these ideas is perfectly clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2 Timothy 3:1</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις ἐνστήσονται καιροὶ χαλεποί</span>[156].The result of an impartial exegesis therefore remains, that—as the other apostles<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>John also expected that the advent of the Lord would <span class="ital">soon</span> take place.[157] It was only when the first generation of believers was already dead, without that expectation having been fulfilled, that in the consciousness of Christians the period till the coming of the Lord extended to an indefinitely <span class="ital">distant</span> limit, without, however, extinguishing the hope of His <span class="ital">speedy</span> advent; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2 Peter 3:4</a> ff.; but that later still the time which began with the appearance of false teachers was regarded as the <span class="ital">last</span>, is proved by Ignatius, <span class="ital">ep. ad Eph.</span> c. xi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ καθὼς ἠκούσατε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] With the observation that it is the last time the apostle connects the other, that in accordance with what his readers have heard, that the <span class="greekheb">ἀντίχριστος</span> would come, many <span class="greekheb">ἀντίχριστοι</span> have already come.

Antichristus pro antichristianismo, sive doctrina, et multitudine hominum Christo contraria dicitur; with this interpretation Lange, Baumgarten-Crusius, Besser, and Myrberg agree. But neither here nor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm" title="Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.">1 John 4:1</a> ff. does John say that Antichrist has already come; here he merely indicates the fact that <span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ ἀντίχριστοι γεγόνασιν</span> as corresponding to the announcement of the coming of Antichrist, and in the other passage it is merely stated that many <span class="greekheb">ψευδοπροφῆται</span> are gone out into the world, and that the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> of Antichrist is already in the world. In the passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm" title="For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.">2 John 1:7</a>, “it is true that the explanatory clause <span class="greekheb">οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ πλάνος καὶ ὁ ἀντίχριστος</span> refers so directly to the preceding <span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ πλάνοι</span>,” that it appears that “the identity is thereby indicated” (1st ed.); but this direct connection may, no doubt, be explained in this way, that he who speaks through the many is, according to John, no other than the one Antichrist; and even though John “neither describes the <span class="greekheb">ἀντίχριστοι</span> as the <span class="greekheb">πρόδρομοι</span>, nor the <span class="greekheb">ἀντίχριστος</span> as the one in whom the principle that animates them is concentrated in highest potency,” it is to be remembered that John is speaking of the Antichrist here, not in doctrinal aspect, but only in order to show by the heretics, whom he calls <span class="greekheb">ἀντίχριστοι</span>, that the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> of Antichrist is already <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ</span>.[159] The name <span class="greekheb">ἀντίχριστος</span> is not found in the Scriptures outside of the First and Second Epistles of John; only in the later ecclesiastical literature does it appear frequently.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That the prefixed <span class="greekheb">ἀντι</span> does not express the substitutionary reference (as in <span class="greekheb">ἀντιβασιλεύς</span>), but the reference of antagonism, is with justice now commonly recognised; but the prevailing translation: “enemy of Christ,” is grammatically inaccurate, as in <span class="ital">substantive</span> compounds formed with <span class="greekheb">ἀντι</span> (in the antagonistic sense) the substantive is an object which by <span class="greekheb">ἀντι</span> is described as standing in opposition to an object of the same kind. Thus, an <span class="greekheb">ἀντιφιλόσοφος</span> is not an “opponent of philosophy” (Ebrard), or of philosophers, but a philosopher who is opposed to other philosophers, a hostile philosopher; comp. <span class="greekheb">ἀντιμαχητής</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀντιπαλαιστής</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀντίπολις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀντίῤῥησις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀντίῤῥοια κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.[160] Accordingly, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀντίχριστος</span> does not mean generally: the enemy of Christ, but the “<span class="ital">opposition Christ</span>,” i.e. <span class="ital">that</span> enemy of Christ who, under the false pretence of being the real Christ, seeks to destroy the work of Christ.[161] Almost all commentators have correctly supposed that John understands by this enemy the same as Paul speaks of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>; the features which appear in the description of the Apostle Paul and in the statements of John correspond too closely to permit of this being doubted; according to both, his appearance in the Church is preceded by a falling away (John says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm" title="They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.">1 John 2:19</a> of the antichrists: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞ ἩΜῶΝ ἘΞῆΛΘΟΝ</span></span></span>; Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1 John 2:3</a> speaks of an <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΣΤΑΣΊΑ</span></span></span> connected with his <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΆΛΥΨΙς</span></span></span>); both ascribe to him a God-opposing, wicked nature (Paul calls him <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ἌΝΘΡΩΠΟς Τῆς ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑς</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ἌΝΟΜΟς</span></span></span>;

both characterize him as a liar, who seeks to establish the lie against the truth; according to both, he appears in the last time before the Parousia of Christ; even the names correspond with each other, for even though the name <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΤΊΧΡΙΣΤΟς</span></span></span> contains an important feature which is not expressed in the name <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ἈΝΤΙΚΕΊΜΕΝΟς</span></span></span>, yet this very feature comes out so distinctly in the Pauline description, that it is clear how suitable John’s appellation of that enemy is; when, namely, Paul describes him as the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΝΘΡΩΠΟς Τῆς ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑς</span></span></span>, and afterwards says of him that he <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΔΕΊΚΝΥΣΙ ἙΑΥΤΌΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὍΤΙ ἘΣΤῚ ΘΕΌς</span></span></span>, this points to the fact that he will represent himself as the <span class="ital">incarnate God</span>,—and this is just what is indicated in the name <span class="greekheb">ἀντίχριστος</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[154] For the contrary, Ebrard appeals to the peculiarly childlike character of this section; but plainly this bears no other character than the <span class="ital">whole</span> Epistle, of which Ebrard himself says that it could only be understood by adults.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[155] Braune, who speaks of Calvin’s view and that of Besser as “worthy of notice,” expresses himself somewhat vaguely when he says: “The expression <span class="greekheb">ἐσχάτη ὥρα</span> is to be taken prophetically, eschatologically, and has a value <span class="ital">connected with the history of the kingdom</span>, even a <span class="ital">historical</span> reference to the <span class="ital">Parousia</span> of Christ, as the beginning of the second era of the world, but no <span class="ital">chronological</span> reference to the date of the commencement of this Paronsia.” Clearly a quite arbitrary assertion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[156] Peculiar, but artificial, is Bengel’s interpretation, which, moreover, rests on the false opinion that the children are here specially addressed: <span class="ital">ultima</span>, non respectu omnium mundi temporum sed in antitheto puerulorum ad patres et ad juvenes. Tres omnino horae erant, quarum una post aliam et inchoavit, et conjunetim continuato cursu ad finem se inclinavit. Patrum itemque juvenum hora statim absoluta fuit. Hinc puerulis Johannes dicit: ultima hora est. Hac ultima hora nos etiamnum vivimus omnes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[157] In opposition to the “prejudice” that the apostles regarded the advent as so near, Sander thinks that they could not possibly have imagined that “all the great changes, transformations, and developments,” to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm" title="But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you, and keep you from evil.">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in....">Romans 11:25-26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/21-24.htm" title="And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled....">Luke 21:24-26</a> allude, could be accomplished within a generation. But could not important events take place within a comparatively short period? As it was not the business of the apostles to foresee the course of history, it cannot be any reproach on them if they cherished the hope that the longed-for coming of the Lord would soon occur, especially as they formed out of this hope no peculiar doctrine, and did not venture to determine the time and the hour. The certainly extravagant assertion of Ebrard, that it would have been contrary to the order of God’s economy of revelation if John, at the time when he wrote his Epistle, had not expected the second advent of Christ in the <span class="ital">near</span> future, rests entirely on Ebrard’s views of the Apocalypse, from the visions of which, according to him, it could only be clear to the apostle for the first time that the <span class="greekheb">ἔρχομαι</span> of the Gospel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-22.htm" title="Jesus said to him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? follow you me.">John 21:22</a> is to be understood of the coming of the Lord in a vision.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[158] Düsterdieck: “With the expectation <span class="greekheb">ἕτι ὁ ἀντιχρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔρχ</span>., founded on the apostolic teaching, corresponds the fact already begun: <span class="greekheb">ἀντιχρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ γεγόνασιν</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[159] Weiss justly maintains, against Frommann and Reuss, according to whom John has spiritualized or confused the dogma of Antichrist, that he in no way denies the reality of the Antichrist, although Weiss thinks that John regards the prophecy of the Antichrist as fulfilled in this, that the spirit of Antichrist has come into the world, and in the false teachers is denying the fundamentals of Christian truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[160] From this it is clear that the rule laid down by Lücke, that “the word compounded with <span class="greekheb">ἀντι</span> is the object of the opposition,” can by no means hold good for all compounds with <span class="greekheb">ἀντι</span>, inasmuch as the examples adduced by Lücke: <span class="greekheb">ἀντίῤῥιον ἄκρον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀντιβόρειος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἁντήλιος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀντίθυρος</span>, are not substantives; and, in the second place, <span class="greekheb">ἀντι</span> does not express in them the idea of hostile antagonism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[161] While Brückner agrees with the explanation given here, it is opposed by Braune; but he does not pay attention to the grammatical vindication. Besides, it is to be observed that the more particular definition of “false pretence” does not lie in the word itself, but certainly in the fact, since there is only <span class="ital">one</span> Christ; it is different in the case of the word <span class="greekheb">ἀντιφιλόσοφος</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the various views of the Antichrist, see Lünemann on <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time....">1 John 2:18-29</a>. A Warning against Heretical Teaching. “Little ones, it is the last hour; and, as ye heard that Antichrist is coming, even now have many antichrists arisen; whence we recognise that it is the last hour. From our company they went out, but they were not of our company; for, if they had been of our company, they would have abode in our fellowship; but the purpose of it was that it may be manifested that they all are not of our company. And <span class="ital">ye</span> have a chrism from the Holy One, and ye all know. I did not write to you because ye did not know the Truth, but because ye know it and because every lie is not of the Truth. Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist—he that denieth the Father and the Son. Every one that denieth the Son neither hath he the Father; he that confesseth the Son hath the Father also. As for you, that which ye heard from the beginning, let it abide in you. If that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning, ye also in the Son and in the Father will abide. And this is the promise which He Himself promised us—the Life, the Eternal Life. These things I wrote to you regarding them that would lead you astray. And as for you, the chrism which ye received from Him abideth in you, and ye have no need that any one should teach you; but, as His chrism is teaching you regarding all things, and is true and is not a lie, and even as it taught you, abide in Him. And now, little children, abide in Him, that, if He be manifested, we may have boldness and not be shamed away from Him at His advent. If ye know that He is righteous, recognise that every one also that doeth righteousness hath been begotten of Him.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A heresy had arisen in the bosom of the Church (see Introd. pp. 156 f.). It was a fatal heresy, a denial of the possibility of the Incarnation, and therefore of the relation of fatherhood and sonship between God and man. St. John’s emphatic condemnation of it was justified, but his apprehension was groundless. He shared the prevailing expectation of the imminence of the Second Advent (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-5.htm" title="Let your moderation be known to all men.

Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.">Revelation 22:20</a>), and saw in the heresy an evidence that the end was at hand. It was rather an evidence that the Gospel was winning its way. The era of simple and unquestioning faith in the apostolic testimony was past, and men were beginning to enquire and reason. A heresy has the same use in theology as a mistaken hypothesis in science: it provokes thought and leads to a deeper understanding. What seemed to the Apostle the pangs of dissolution were in reality “growing pains”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>18–26. The Persons to be Avoided;—Antichrists<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">Little children</span>] Or, <span class="ital">Little ones</span>. It is difficult to see anything in this section specially suitable to children: indeed the very reverse is rather the case. The same word (<span class="greekheb">παιδία</span>) is used here as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-14.htm" title="I have written to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God stays in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.">1 John 2:14</a></span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-5.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Children, have you any meat? They answered him, No.">John 21:5</a>. S. John’s readers in general are addressed, irrespective of age. Both his Epistle and Gospel are written for adults and for well-instructed Christians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">it is the last time</span>] More literally, <span class="ital">it is the last</span> <span class="bld">hour</span>; possibly, but not probably, <span class="ital">it is a last hour</span>. The omission of the definite article is quite intelligible and not unusual: the idea is sufficiently definite without it, for there can be only one last hour. Similarly (Judges 18) we have ‘<span class="ital">in (the) last time</span> there shall be mockers walking after their own ungodly lusts’: and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm" title="But you shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come on you: and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and to the uttermost part of the earth.">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-47.htm" title="For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set you to be a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.">Acts 13:47</a>) ‘<span class="ital">unto (the) uttermost part</span> of the earth’. A great deal has been written upon this text in order to avoid a very plain but unwelcome conclusion, that by the ‘last hour’ S. John means the time immediately preceding the return of Christ to judge the world. Hundreds of years have passed away since S. John wrote these words, and the Lord is not yet come. Rather, therefore, than admit an interpretation which seemed to charge the Apostle with a serious error, commentators have suggested all kinds of explanations as substitutes for the obvious one. The following considerations place S. John’s meaning beyond all reasonable doubt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. He has just been stating that the world is on the wane and that its dissolution has already begun. 2. He has just declared that the obedient Christian shall abide ‘unto the age’ of Christ’s kingdom of glory. 3. He goes on to give as a proof that it is the ‘last hour’, that many Antichrists have already arisen; it being the common belief of Christians that Antichrist would immediately precede the return of Christ. 4. ‘The last day’ is a phrase peculiar to S. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day....">John 6:39-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-44.htm" title="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-54.htm" title="Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-24.htm" title="Martha said to him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.">John 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-48.htm" title="He that rejects me, and receives not my words, has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.">John 12:48</a>), and invariably means the end of the world, not the Christian dispensation. 5. Analogous phrases in other parts of N.T. point in the same direction: ‘In the last days grievous times shall come’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2 Timothy 3:1</a>); ‘Ye are guarded through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1 Peter 1:5</a>); ‘In the last days mockers shall come with mockery’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-3.htm" title="Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,">2 Peter 3:3</a>). These and other passages shew that by ‘the last days’, ‘last time’, ‘last hour’, and the like, Christian writers did not mean the whole time between the first and second coming of Christ, but only the concluding portion of it. 6. We find similar language with similar meaning in the sub-apostolic age. Thus Ignatius (<span class="ital">Eph.</span> XI.) writes; “These are the last times. Henceforth let us be reverent; let us fear the longsuffering of God, lest it turn into a judgment against us. For either let us fear the wrath which is to come, or let us love the grace which now is.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of other interpretations of ‘the last hour’ the most noteworthy are these. (1) <span class="ital">The Christian dispensation</span>, which we have every reason to believe is the last. This is the sense in which S. John’s words are <span class="ital">true</span>; but this is plainly not his <span class="ital">meaning</span>. The appearance of Christ, not of Antichrist, proves that the Christian dispensation is come. (2) <span class="ital">A very grievous time</span>, <span class="ital">tempora periculosa pessima et abjectissima</span>. This is quite against usage whether in classical or N.T. Greek: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2 Timothy 3:1</a>. The classical phrase, ‘to suffer the last things’, i.e. ‘to suffer extremities’ (<span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔσχατα παθεῖν</span>), supplies no analogy: here the notion of ‘grievous’ comes from the verb. (3) <span class="ital">The eve of the destruction of Jerusalem</span>. How could the appearance of Antichrist prove that this had arrived? And Jerusalem had perished at least a dozen years before the probable date of this Epistle. (4) <span class="ital">The eve of S. John’s own death</span>. Antichrists could be no sign of that.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is admitted even by some of those who reject the obvious interpretation that “the Apostles expected a speedy appearing or manifestation of Jesus as the Judge of their nation and of all nations” (Maurice): which is to admit the whole difficulty of the rejected explanation. Only gradually was the vision of the Apostles cleared to see the true nature of the spiritual kingdom which Christ had founded on earth and left in their charge. Even Pentecost did not at once give them perfect insight. Being under the guidance of the Holy Spirit they could not teach what was untrue: but, like the Prophets before them, they sometimes uttered words which were true in a sense far higher than that which was present to their own minds. In this higher sense S. John’s words here are true. Like others, he was wrong in supposing ‘that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-11.htm" title="And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.">Luke 19:11</a>), for ‘it was not for them to know times or seasons which the Father hath set within His own authority’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-7.htm" title="And he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power.">Acts 1:7</a>). He was right in declaring that, the Messiah having come, it was the ‘last hour’. No event in the world’s history can ever equal the coming of Christ until He comes again. The epoch of Christianity, therefore, is rightly called the ‘last hour’, although it has lasted nearly two thousand years. What is that compared with the many thousands of years since the creation of man, and the limitless geological periods which preceded the creation of man? What again in the eyes of Him in whose sight ‘a thousand years are but yesterday?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“It may be remarked that the only point on which we can certainly say that the Apostles were in error, and led others into error, is in their expectation of the immediate coming of Christ; and this is the very point which our Saviour says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.">Mark 13:32</a>) is known only to the Father” (Jelf).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come</span>] Better, <span class="bld">even</span> <span class="ital">as ye</span> <span class="bld">heard</span> <span class="ital">that Antichrist</span> <span class="bld">cometh</span>: the first verb is aorist, not perfect; the second present, not future; and the conjunction is of the same strong form as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1 John 2:6</a></span>. This seems to be a case in which the aorist should be retained in English (see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-11.htm" title="But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.">1 John 2:11</a></span>). As in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.">1 John 2:7</a></span>, the reference is probably to a definite point in their instruction in the faith: and ‘cometh’ should be retained in order to bring out the analogy between the Christ and the Antichrist. The one was hoped for, and the other dreaded, with equal certainty; and hence each might be spoken of as ‘He that cometh’. ‘Art Thou <span class="ital">He that cometh</span>?’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-3.htm" title="And said to him, Are you he that should come, or do we look for another?">Matthew 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-20.htm" title="And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:">Luke 19:20</a>). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-38.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.">Mark 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-9.htm" title="And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord:">Mark 11:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm" title="The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.">John 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm" title="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.">John 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-27.htm" title="She said to him, Yes, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.">John 11:27</a>, &c. &c. And as to the coming of Antichrists the N. T. seems to be as explicit as the O. T. with regard to the coming of Christ. ‘Many shall come in My name, saying I am the Christ; and shall lead many astray … There shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; so as to lead astray, if possible even the elect’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-5.htm" title="For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.">Matthew 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm" title="For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.">Matthew 24:24</a>). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/13-22.htm" title="For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect....">Mark 13:22-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm" title="For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.">Acts 20:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2 Timothy 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm" title="But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privately shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction.">2 Peter 2:1</a>; and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>, which like the passage before us seems to point to one distinct person or power as the one Antichrist, whose spirit animates all antichristian teachers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The term ‘Antichrist’ in Scripture occurs only in the First and Second Epistles of S. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm" title="Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son.">1 John 2:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1 John 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm" title="For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.">2 John 1:7</a>). The earliest instance of its use outside Scripture is in S. Polycarp (<span class="ital">Ep. ad Phil</span>, VII.), in a passage which shews that this disciple of S. John (a.d. 140–155) knew our Epistle: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1 John 4:3</a>. The term does not mean merely a <span class="ital">mock Christ or false Christ</span>, for which the N.T. term is ‘pseudo-Christ’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm" title="For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.">Matthew 24:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-22.htm" title="For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.">Mark 13:22</a>). Nor does it mean simply <span class="ital">an opponent of Christ</span>, for which we should probably have ‘enemy of Christ’, like ‘enemy of the Cross of Christ’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-18.htm" title="(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:">Php 3:18</a>) and ‘enemy of God’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-4.htm" title="You adulterers and adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.">James 4:4</a>). But it includes <span class="ital">both</span> these ideas of counterfeiting and opposing; it means an <span class="ital">opposition Christ or rival Christ</span>; just as we call a rival Pope an ‘antipope’. The Antichrist is, therefore, a <span class="ital">usurper</span>, who under false pretences assumes a position which does not belong to him, and who <span class="ital">opposes</span> the rightful owner. The idea of opposition is the predominant one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is not easy to determine whether the Antichrist of S. John is personal or not. But the discussion of this question is too long for a note: see Appendix B.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">even now are there many Antichrists</span>] Better, as R.V., even now <span class="bld">have there arisen</span> <span class="ital">many Antichrists</span>: the Christ <span class="ital">was</span> from all eternity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1 John 1:1</a>), the Antichrist and his company <span class="ital">arose</span> in time; they <span class="ital">are come into being</span>. We have a similar contrast in the Gospel: ‘In the beginning <span class="ital">was</span> the Word’; but ‘There <span class="ital">arose</span> a man, sent from God, whose name was John’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm" title="There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.">John 1:6</a>). These ‘many Antichrists’ are probably to be regarded as at once forerunners of the Antichrist and evidence that his spirit is already at work in the world: the one fact shews that he is not far distant, the other that in a sense he is already here. In either case we have proof that the return of Christ, which is to be heralded by the appearance of Antichrist, is near.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whereby we know that it is the last time</span>] Or, <span class="bld">whence we come to know</span> <span class="ital">that it is the last</span> <span class="bld">hour</span>: as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1 John 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1 John 2:5</a></span> the verb indicates acquisition of and progress in knowledge. ‘Whence’ in the sense of ‘from which data, from which premises’ hardly occurs elsewhere in N.T. except perhaps in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-17.htm" title="And the world passes away, and the lust thereof: but he that does the will of God stays for ever.">1 John 2:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-25.htm" title="Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?">John 7:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-3.htm" title="And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the middle,">John 8:3</a>), where the same Greek word (<span class="greekheb">ὅθεν</span>) is uniformly rendered ‘wherefore’ in both A.V. and R.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is difficult to see what S. John could have meant by this, if by the ‘last hour’ he understood the Christian dispensation as a whole and not the concluding portion of it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2 Timothy 3:1</a>). The multitude of false teachers who were spreading the great lie (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm" title="Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son.">1 John 2:22</a></span>) that Jesus is not the Christ, were evidence, not of the existence of Christianity, but of antichristianity. Nor could evidence of the former be needed by S. John’s readers. They did not need to be convinced either that the Gospel dispensation had begun, or that it was the last in the history of the Divine Revelation. The Montanist theory that a further dispensation of the Spirit, distinct from that of the Son, was to follow and supersede the Gospel, as the Gospel had superseded Judaism, the dispensation of the Father, was a belief of later growth. (For an account of this theory as elaborated by Joachim of Flora [fl. a.d. 1180–90] see Döllinger’s <span class="ital">Prophecies and the Prophetic Spirit in the Christian Era</span>, pp. 114–119.) In the Apostolic age the tendency was all the other way;—to believe that the period since the coming of Christ was not only the last in the world’s history, but would be very brief. It was thought that some of the generation then existing might live to see the end (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep....">1 Thessalonians 4:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,...">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>B. Antichrist<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a> it has been pointed out that the term ‘Antichrist’ is in N. T. peculiar to the Epistles of S. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm" title="Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ?

This is a deceiver and an antichrist.">2 John 1:7</a>), and that in meaning it seems to combine the ideas of a mock Christ and an opponent of Christ, but that the latter idea is the prominent one. The false claims of a rival Christ are more or less included in the signification; but the predominant notion is that of hostility.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It remains to say something on two other points of interest. I. Is the Antichrist of S. John a person or a tendency, an individual man or a principle? II. Is the Antichrist of S. John identical with the great adversary spoken of by S. Paul in 2 Thessalonians 2? The answer to the one question will to a certain extent depend upon the answer to the other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I. It will be observed that S. John introduces the term ‘Antichrist,’ as he introduces the term ‘Logos’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1 John 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>), without any explanation. He expressly states that it is one with which his readers are familiar; ‘even as ye heard that Antichrist cometh.’ Certainly this, the first introduction of the name, looks like an allusion to a person. All the more so when we remember that the Christ was ‘He that cometh’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-3.htm" title="And said to him, Are you he that should come, or do we look for another?">Matthew 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-20.htm" title="And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is your pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:">Luke 19:20</a>). Both Christ and Antichrist had been the subject of prophecy, and therefore each might be spoken of as ‘He that cometh.’ But it is by no means conclusive. We may understand ‘Antichrist’ to mean an impersonal power, or principle, or tendency, exhibiting itself in the words and conduct of individuals, without doing violence to the passage. In the one case the ‘many antichrists’ will be forerunners of the great personal opponent; in the other the antichristian spirit which they exhibit may be regarded as Antichrist. But the balance of probability seems to be in favour of the view that the Antichrist, of which S. John’s readers had heard as certain to come shortly before the end of the world, is a person.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such is not the case with the other three passages in which the term occurs. ‘Who is the liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist, even he that denieth the Father and the Son’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm" title="Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son.">1 John 2:22</a>). There were many who denied that Jesus is the Christ and thereby denied not only the Son but the Father of whom the Son is the revelation and representative. Therefore once more we have many antichrists, each one of whom may be spoken of as ‘the Antichrist,’ inasmuch as he exhibits the antichristian characteristics. No doubt this does not exclude the idea of a person who should have these characteristics in the highest possible degree, and who had not yet appeared. But this passage <span class="ital">taken by itself</span> would hardly suggest such a person.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So also with the third passage in the First Epistle. ‘Every spirit which confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the (spirit) of the Antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh, and now is in the world already’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1 John 4:3</a>). Here it is no longer ‘the Antichrist’ that is spoken of, but ‘the spirit of the Antichrist.’ This is evidently a principle; which again does not exclude, though it would not necessarily suggest or imply, the idea of a person who would embody this antichristian spirit of denial.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage in the Second Epistle is similar to the second passage in the First Epistle. ‘Many deceivers are gone forth into the world, even they that confess not Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.">1 John 2:7</a></span>). Here again we have many who exhibit the characteristics of Antichrist. Each one of them, and also the spirit which animates them, may be spoken of as ‘the Antichrist;’ the further idea of an individual who shall exhibit this spirit in an extraordinary manner being neither necessarily excluded, nor necessarily implied.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first of the four passages, therefore, will have to interpret the other three. And as the interpretation of that passage cannot be determined beyond dispute, we must be content to admit that the question as to whether the Antichrist of S. John is personal or not cannot be answered with certainty. The probability seems to be in favour of an affirmative answer. In the passage which <span class="ital">introduces</span> the subject (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>) the Antichrist, of which the Apostle’s little children had heard as coming, appears to be a person of whom the ‘many antichrists’ with their lying doctrine are the heralds and already existing representatives. And it may well be that, having introduced the term with the personal signification familiar to his readers, the Apostle goes on to make other uses of it; in order to warn them that, although the personal Antichrist has not yet come, yet his spirit and doctrine are already at work in the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nevertheless, we must allow that, if we confine our attention to the passages of S. John in which the term occurs, the balance in favour of the view that he looked to the coming of a personal Antichrist is far from conclusive. This balance, however, whatever its amount, is considerably augmented when we take a wider range and consider—(<span class="ital">a</span>) The origin of the doctrine which the Apostle says that his readers had already heard respecting Antichrist; (<span class="ital">b</span>) The treatment of the question by those who followed S. John as teachers in the Church; (<span class="ital">c</span>) Other passages in the N. T. which seem to bear upon the question. The discussion of this third point is placed last because it involves the second question to be investigated in this Appendix;—Is the Antichrist of S. John identical with S. Paul’s ‘man of sin.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) There can be little doubt that the <span class="ital">origin</span> of the primitive doctrine respecting Antichrist is <span class="ital">the Book of Daniel</span>, to which our Lord Himself had drawn attention in speaking of the ‘abomination of desolation’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-15.htm" title="When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)">Matthew 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm" title="And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured on the desolate.">Daniel 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-11.htm" title="And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.">Daniel 12:11</a>). The causing the daily sacrifice to cease, which was one great element of this desolation, at once brings these passages into connexion with the ‘little horn’ of <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_john/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Παιδία</span>, <span class="ital">little children</span>) See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.">1 John 2:12</a>.

Whether the phraseology of the apostles or the language of the faithful led to the introduction of that word, John, about to cut off [guard against] the errors which might arise, wishes mention to be made not only of <span class="ital">antichrist</span>, but also of <span class="ital">antichrists</span>: and when he speaks of <span class="ital">antichrist</span>, or <span class="ital">the spirit of antichrist</span>, or <span class="ital">a deceiver and antichrist</span>, though he speaks in the singular number, he designs to point out all who are <span class="ital">deceivers</span> and enemies of the truth. The faithful had heard that the <span class="ital">spirit of antichrist</span>, and <span class="ital">antichrist himself</span>, should come. John acknowledges that, and adds, <span class="ital">that the spirit of antichrist is now already in the world, that now there had arisen many antichrists</span>. And as <span class="ital">Christ</span> is sometimes spoken of for <span class="ital">Christianity</span>, so <span class="ital">antichrist</span> is spoken of for <span class="ital">antichristianity</span>, or the doctrine and multitude of men opposed to Christ.

John so admits that <span class="ital">antichrist</span> even then was come, as to teach, that not one only, but many antichrists had come; a matter which he considers of greater consequence and more disastrous. The whole class of those, who have any good or evil disposition, is often expressed in the singular number with the article. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ἀγαθὸς ἄνθρωπος</span>, <span class="ital">the good man</span> [every man that is good], etc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-35.htm" title="A good man out of the good treasure of the heart brings forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.">Matthew 12:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-17.htm" title="And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to you as an heathen man and a publican.">Matthew 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-18.htm" title="And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?">1 Peter 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-8.htm" title="Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.">Titus 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm" title="The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.">John 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm" title="But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.">John 10:12</a>; and so everywhere, especially in Proverbs, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:...">1 John 4:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-6.htm" title="We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us.

It is the last hour. What does this mean? There is scarcely room for doubt. The perishableness of the world has suggested the thought of its end, and St. John goes on to warn his readers that this thought is full of meaning to them; for they may recognize the time in which they are living as the last hour by the many antichrists that have arisen. "The last hour" can only mean <span class="accented">the last hour before the second coming of Christ.</span> Nothing but the unwillingness of Christians to admit that an apostle, and especially the Apostle St. John, could seem to be much in error about the nearness of the day of judgment, could have raised a question about language so plain. All explanations about its signifying the Christian dispensation, or the nearness of St. John's death, or the nearness of the destruction of Jerusalem, must be firmly set aside. How could the rising of antichrists show that the Christian dispensation had begun? It was Christ, not antichrist, that showed that? What had antichrists to do with St. John's death? or with the fall of Jerusalem, which, moreover, had fallen many years before this Epistle was written? Just as the apostles, even after the Resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>), remained grossly ignorant of the <span class="accented">nature</span> of Christ's kingdom on earth, so to the last they remained ignorant of its <span class="accented">duration.</span> The primitive Church had not yet found its true perspective, and, in common with all Christians of the first age, the apostles believed that Christ would return soon, possibly within the lifetime of some then living. "Yea, I come quickly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>) was by them understood in the most literal sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;</span>. But it will not surprise those who remember Christ's very strong declaration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>), to find even an apostle in ignorance as to the time of the second advent of Christ. But it may very reasonably and reverently be asked, What becomes of the inspiration of Scripture if an inspired writer tells the Church that the end of the world is near, when it is not near? The question of inspiration must follow that of interpretation, not lead it. Let us patiently examine the facts, and then try to frame a theory of inspiration that will cover them; not first frame our theory, and then force the facts to agree with it. But the question in its proper place requires an answer. The Old Testament prophets were often guided to utter language the Divine meaning of which they did not themselves understand. They uttered the words in one sense, and the words were true in a far higher sense, of which they scarcely dreamed. The same thing is true of the New Testament prophets,  though in a less degree, because the gift of Pentecost had given them powers of insight which their predecessors had not possessed. The present text seems to be an illustration of this truth. We can hardly doubt that, in saying, "it is the last hour," St. John means to imply that within a few years, or possibly even less time, Christ will return to judgment. In this sense the statement is not true. But it may also mean that the last period in the world's history has begun; and in this sense we have good reason for believing that the statement is true. "That one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day" is not rhetoric, but sober fact. By the Divine standard times are measured, not according to their duration, but their importance; it is their meaning, not their extent, which gives them value. What are all the measureless prehistoric aeons of the material universe compared with the time since the creation of rational life? What are the thousands of years covered by the Old Testament compared with the portion of a century covered by the New? The great crisis in the history of the world, constituted by the life and death of Christ, will never be equaled until he comes again. When he ascended to heaven the last hour sounded. There may follow a silence (as it seemed to St. John) about the space of half an hour, but (as human experience may prove) of half a thousand centuries. Yet the duration of the period, as measured by man, will not alter its essential characteristics; it was, is, and will still remain, "the last hour." <span class="cmt_word">Even as ye heard</span> (when ye were instructed in the faith) <span class="cmt_word">that antichrist cometh</span> (is destined to come). Antichrist in this also is assimilated to the Christ; he is <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. This was the teaching of the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5, 11, 23-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22, 23</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). What does St. John mean by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>? The four passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm">1 John 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a>) in which he uses the term do not enable us to answer the question with certainty. The predominant idea is that of <span class="accented">opposition</span> to Christ, and <span class="accented">rivalry</span> of Christ, rather than merely of <span class="accented">counterfeiting</span> Christ. If <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> were formed on the analogy of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, it would mean "vice-Christ, vicar of Christ." It is, however, analogous to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and the Greek for a counterfeit Christ is <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>). But we are left in doubt whether this rival of Christ is a principle or a person. None of the four passages is decisive. Here we are not sure whether the arising of many antichrists proves that the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of antichrist is already in the world, or that by them the way is fully prepared for the one <span class="accented">personal</span> antichrist. Either the existence of the antichristian character, or the approach of the antichrist, is given as evidence that the day of the Lord is at hand. The latter is the more probable. A great personal opponent to the personal Christ seems to be indicated both by St. John and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1-8</a>). The Jews expected a personal opponent of the Messiah to precede the Messiah - Armillus, Gog, Antiochus Epiphanes, and the like (Ezekiel 38:39; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a>); and Christians from the earliest times have expected a similar prelude to the return of the Messiah. The term <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is absolutely peculiar to St. John in the New Testament. By the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> he probably means those early heretical teachers, who in various ways denied the Incarnation, and were thus forerunners of the antichrist - the Nicolaitanes, Simon Magus, Cerinthus, Diotrephes, Hymenaeus, and Philetus. Besides these there are practical antichrists. "Let us mark, not the tongue but the deeds. For if all be asked, all with one mouth confess that Jesus is the Christ. Let the tongue keep silent awhile: ask the life. If the Scripture itself shall tell us that denial is a thing done not only with the tongue, but also with deeds, then assuredly we find many antichrists if deeds are to be questioned, not only do we find many antichrists gone out, but many not yet manifest, who have not gone out at all" (St. Augustine). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Little children (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-13.htm">1 John 2:13</a>.<p>The last hour (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;)<p>The phrase only here in the New Testament.

The dominant sense of the expression last days, in the New Testament, is that of a period of suffering and struggle preceding a divine victory.

Hence the phrase here does not refer to the end of the world, but to the period preceding a crisis in the advance of Christ's kingdom, a changeful and troublous period, marked by the appearance of "many antichrists."<p>Antichrist<p>Peculiar to John in the New Testament. The absence of the article shows its currency as a proper name. It may mean one who stands against Christ, or one who stands instead of Christ; just as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; may mean either one who stands in the place of a &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; praetor, a propraetor (see Introd. to Luke, vol. 1, p. 246, and note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-20.htm">Acts 16:20</a>), or an opposing general. John never uses the word &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; false Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>). While the false Christ is merely a pretender to the Messianic office, the Antichrist "assails Christ by proposing to do or to preserve what he did, while denying Him." Antichrist, then, is one who opposes Christ in the guise of Christ. Westcott's remark is very important, that John's sense of Antichrist is determined by the full Christian conception of Christ, and not by the Jewish conception of the promised Savior.<p>Cometh (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>The prophetic present, equivalent to is about to come.
