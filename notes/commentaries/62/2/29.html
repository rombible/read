What value should we put upon gospel truth! Thereby the promise of eternal life is made sure. The promise God makes, is suitable to his own greatness, power, and goodness; it is eternal life. The Spirit of truth will not lie; and he teaches all things in the present dispensation, all things necessary to our knowledge of God in Christ, and their glory in the gospel. The apostle repeats the kind words, little children; which denotes his affection. He would persuade by love. Gospel privileges oblige to gospel duties; and those anointed by the Lord Jesus abide with him. The new spiritual nature is from the Lord Christ. He that is constant to the practice of religion in trying times, shows that he is born from above, from the Lord Christ. Then, let us beware of holding the truth in unrighteousness, remembering that those only are born of God, who bear his holy image, and walk in his most righteous ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If ye know that he is righteous - This is not said as if there could be any doubt on the subject, but merely to call their attention to it as a well-known truth, and to state what followed from it. Everyone who has any true acquaintance with God, must have the fullest conviction that he is a righteous Being. But, if this be so, John says, then it must follow that only those who are truly righteous can regard themselves as begotten of Him.<p>Ye know - Margin, "know ye." The Greek will bear either construction, and either would make good sense. Assuming that God is righteous, it would be proper to state, as in the text, that it followed from this that they must know that only those who are righteous can be regarded as begotten of Him; or, assuming this to be true, it was proper to exhort them to be righteous, as in the margin. Whichever interpretation is adopted, the great truth is taught, that only those who are truly righteous can regard themselves as the children of God.<p>That everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him - Or rather, is begotten of Him; is truly a child of God. This truth is everywhere taught in the Bible, and is worthy of being often repeated. No one who is not, in the proper sense of the term, a righteous man, can have any wellfounded pretensions to being regarded as a child of God. If this be so, then it is not difficult to determine whether we are the children of God.<p>(1) if we are unjust, false, dishonest, we cannot be His children.<p>(2) if we are indulging in any known sin, we cannot be.<p>(3) if we are not truly righteous, all visions and rapture, all zeal and ardor, though in the cause of religion, all that we may pride ourselves on in being fervent in prayer, or eloquent in preaching, is vain.<p>(4) if we are righteous, in the true and proper sense, doing that which is right toward God and toward people, to ourselves, to our families, to our neighbors, to the world at large, to the Saviour who died for us, then we are true Christians; and then, no matter how soon he may appear, or how solemn and overwhelming the scenes that shall close the world, we shall not be ashamed or confounded, for we shall hail him as our Saviour, and rejoice that the time has come that we may go and dwell with him forever. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. The heading of the second division of the Epistle: "God is righteous; therefore, every one that doeth righteousness is born of Him." Love is the grand feature and principle of "righteousness" selected for discussion, 1Jo 2:29-3:3.<p>If ye know &#8230; ye know&#8212;distinct Greek verbs: "if ye are aware (are in possession of the knowledge) &#8230; ye discern or apprehend also that," &c. Ye are already aware that God ("He" includes both "the Father," of whom the believer is born (end of this verse, and 1Jo 3:1), and "the Son," 1Jo 2:1, 23) is righteous, ye must necessarily, thereby, perceive also the consequence of that truth, namely, "that everyone that doeth righteousness (and he alone; literally, the righteousness such as the righteous God approves) is born of Him." The righteous produceth the righteous. We are never said to be born again of Christ, but of God, with whom Christ is one. Hollaz in Alford defines the righteousness of God, "It is the divine energy by whose power God wills and does all things which are conformable to His eternal law, prescribes suitable laws to His creatures, fulfils His promises to men, rewards the good, and punishes the ungodly."<p>doeth&#8212;"For the graces (virtues) are practical, and have their being in being produced (in being exercised); for when they have ceased to act, or are only about to act, they have not even being" [ŒCUMENIUS]. "God is righteous, and therefore the source of righteousness; when then a man doeth righteousness, we know that the source of his righteousness is God, that consequently he has acquired by new birth from God that righteousness which he had not by nature. We argue from his doing righteousness, to his being born of God. The error of Pelagians is to conclude that doing righteousness is a condition of becoming a child of God" [Alford most truly]. Compare Lu 7:47, 50: Her much love evinced that her sins were already forgiven; not, were the condition of her sins being forgiven.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_john/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Lest he should be thought only solicitous to preserve among them the right notions of the Christian docrine, as if that alone would suffice them for their salvation and blessedness, (which was the conceit of the Gnostics, touching their own notions, that the entertaining of them would save men, whatsoever men they were, or howsoever they lived), he subjoins this serious monition: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If ye know, </span>& c., intimating, that whatsoever they had of the knowledge of God would avail them nothing, if, whereas <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">he is righteous, </span> they were not transformed by it into his likeness, and enabled thereby to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">do righteousness, </span> which alone would evidence their Divine birth, since God hath no children destitute of his image, or who resemble him not. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_john/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If ye know that he is righteous,.... That is, Christ, who is righteous as God in his nature and in his works; and as man in his obedience, life, and conversation; and as Mediator, in faithfully discharging the work he undertook; and is the author of an everlasting righteousness, which is imputed by God, revealed in the Gospel, and received by faith; all which they knew, for this is not said as doubting, but rather as taking it for granted that they did know it; "if", or "seeing ye know", &amp;c. then it follows; <p>ye know, or "know ye"; ye may assure yourselves, <p>that everyone that doeth righteousness; not merely works of righteousness, especially in order to justify him before God; for such an one is so far from being born of God, or born again, that he is manifestly in a state of nature, and of opposition to, and enmity against God; he is not subject to him, he does not submit to the righteousness of God, but goes about to establish his own and betrays his ignorance and want grace; but it intends such an one who with the heart believes unto righteousness, and lays hold by faith, and lives upon the righteousness of Christ for justification; and who performs, good, works in faith, and from a principle of love, not to obtain a justifying righteousness, but because he is justified by the righteousness of Christ: and: such an one <p>is born of him; either of God, or rather, of Christ; being regenerated by his Spirit, having his, grace implanted in him, as appears by his faith in his righteousness and by his works of righteousness, as fruits of faith; and having his image stamped on him, and he himself formed in him, and so made like unto him; by all which it is evident he is one of his spiritual seed and offspring. The Syriac version reads, "is of him"; belongs to him, is one of his; and this makes way for what is said of adoption in the following chapter and which should begin here. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{27}</span> If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.</span><p>(27) A passing over to the treatise following, which tends to the same purpose, but yet is more ample, and handles the same matter in another way, for before he taught us to go from the effects to the cause, and in this that follows, he goes from the causes to the effects.

From the predicate <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> nothing can be inferred, as this attribute is assigned by John both to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>) and Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

As, with John’s peculiar blending of the Father and the Son (or of God and Christ), it would not be easy to explain how he can pass from the one to the other without specially indicating it, it appears more safe, in accordance with the constant mode of conception and expression in the Epistle, to supply as the subject of <span class="greekheb">δίκαιός ἐστι</span> <span class="ital">God</span>, than <span class="ital">Christ.</span> It is inappropriate, with Storr, Lücke, and others, to refer <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> to Christ, and <span class="greekheb">ἐξ αὐτοῦ</span>, on the other hand, to God, because the thought of the apostle would thereby lose its peculiar force (Bengel: justus justum gignit).[186]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The statement that God is <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> corresponds with the statement that He is <span class="greekheb">φῶς</span> (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a>); it does not follow from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a> that by <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> here the justitia judicialis is to be understood; Erdmann: quum <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν τὴν δικαιοσύνην</span> ad <span class="greekheb">δίκαιός ἐστι</span> referendum sit, hoc justitiam Dei sensu judiciali significare nequit, sed absolutam ejus sanctitatem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γινώσκετε</span>] is here not to be regarded as the indicative (Beza, Bengel, Semler, Düsterdieck, Myrberg, Ewald, and others), but, as its position between <span class="greekheb">μένετε</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>) and <span class="greekheb">ἴδετε</span> (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not.">1 John 3:1</a>) shows, as the imperative: “<span class="ital">then know</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">observe and reflect</span>,” with Vulgate, Grotius, Russmeyer, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette, Lücke, Erdmeyer, Ebrard, Braune, and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι πᾶς</span> … <span class="greekheb">γεγέννηται</span>] The same relationship in which, according to chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>, <span class="greekheb">κοινωνίαν ἔχειν μετὰ Θεοῦ</span> and <span class="greekheb">περιπατεῖν ἐκ τῷ φωτί</span> stand to one another, exists between <span class="greekheb">γεγεννῆσθαι ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν τὴν δικαιοσύνην</span> (so also Braune), inasmuch as the latter is the practical proof of the former, so that every one who practises righteousness—but no one else (Bengel: omnis et solus)—is born of God. That when Episcopius describes the nasci ex Deo, not as the condition, but as the result of the exercitii justitiae, he perverts the thought of the apostle, needs no proof.

But if the latter cannot be, if <span class="greekheb">ἐξ αὐτοῦ</span> can only be referred to God, then <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span> must also be referred to God.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[187] The thought that only he who is born of God can practise righteousness, is not exactly expressed here by John, but it is suggested in the preceding <span class="greekheb">πᾶ</span>;. When Lücke in his 2d ed. says: “We might have properly expected <span class="greekheb">ὅτι πᾶς ὁ γεγεννημένος ἐξ αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖ τὴν δικαιοσύνην</span>; but John would appear to have the purpose of exciting in his readers the consciousness of sonship to God in Christ, therefore he states the reversed relation,”—this is erroneous, since it is rather <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν τὴν δικαιοσύνην</span> that has the chief emphasis; in his 1st ed. Lücke correctly stated the thought of the apostle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[188] The definition of Weiss: “The being born of God is the act by which the known nature of God, and therewith God Himself, who indeed is received into our entire spiritual life as the object of that intuitive knowledge, operates determiningly, mouldingly, regeneratingly, upon our spiritual and moral being,” is in various aspects unsuitable; for (1) it is not so much the act of God as rather the activity of man, his knowledge, which is represented as causing the being born of God; (2) it is erroneous to describe the <span class="ital">birth</span> as <span class="ital">producing</span>, since the birth is the result of the generating activity; (3) it is no doubt true that the birth is brought about by knowledge, for it is only by producing in man the knowledge of His nature that God produces in him the new birth; but, on the other hand, it is just as true that the knowledge of God is conditioned by the being born of God: only he who is born of God knows God; there are two grades of the knowledge to be distinguished, namely, the knowledge as condition, and the knowledge as result, of being born of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a>.

And clearly ‘He’ and ‘Him’ must be interpreted alike: it destroys the argument (<span class="ital">justus justum gignit</span>, as Bengel puts it) to interpret ‘He is righteous’ of Christ and ‘born of Him’ of God.

But S. John is so full of the truth that Christ and the Father are one, and that Christ is God revealed to man, that he makes the transition from one to the other almost imperceptibly. Had his readers asked him of one of these ambiguous passages, ‘Are you speaking of Christ or of God’? he would perhaps have replied, ‘Does it matter’?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye know</span>] Or, <span class="ital">know ye</span>; but this is less probable, though the Vulgate has <span class="ital">scitote</span>, and Wiclif, Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Rhemish, all take it as imperative. ‘Ye know’ is more in harmony with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things....">1 John 2:20-21</a></span>. It is remarkable how frequently in S. John’s writings we are in doubt as to whether a verb is imperative or indicative (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-19.htm" title="The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive you how you prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.">John 12:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-1.htm" title="Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe also in me.">John 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm" title="If the world hate you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.">John 15:18</a>). Even in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a></span>, though there is scarcely a doubt, it is possible to take ‘abide’ as an indicative. After, ‘ye know that every one’ we must supply ‘also’; <span class="ital">ye know that every one</span> <span class="bld">also</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is a change of verb from ‘if ye know’ (<span class="greekheb">ἐὰν εἰδῆτε</span>) to ‘ye know that’ (<span class="greekheb">γινώσκετε ὅτι</span>). The former means ‘to have intuitive knowledge’ or simply ‘to be aware of the fact’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-11.htm" title="But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.">1 John 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things....">1 John 2:20-21</a></span>): the latter means ‘to come to know, learn by experience, recognise, perceive’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments....">1 John 2:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-13.htm" title="I write to you, fathers, because you have known him that is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father....">1 John 2:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a></span>). ‘If ye <span class="ital">are aware</span> that God is righteous, ye cannot fail to <span class="ital">perceive</span> that &c.’ Comp. ‘What I do thou <span class="ital">knowest</span> not now, but thou shalt <span class="ital">understand</span> (get to know) hereafter’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-7.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.">John 13:7</a>); ‘Lord, Thou <span class="ital">knowest</span> all things; Thou <span class="ital">perceivest</span> that I love Thee’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-17.htm" title="He said to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Love you me? And he said to him, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus said to him, Feed my sheep.">John 21:17</a>): and the converse change: ‘If ye had <span class="ital">learned to know</span> Me, ye would <span class="ital">know</span> My Father also’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-7.htm" title="If you had known me, you should have known my Father also: and from now on you know him, and have seen him.">John 14:7</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-55.htm" title="Yet you have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like to you: but I know him, and keep his saying.">John 8:55</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which doeth righteousness</span>] Perhaps we should translate, <span class="ital">that doeth</span> <span class="bld">His</span> <span class="ital">righteousness</span>. It is literally, <span class="ital">that doeth the righteousness</span>; but in Greek the definite article is often equivalent to our possessive pronoun. Or ‘the righteousness’ may mean ‘the righteousness which is truly such’: comp. ‘to do the truth’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>). The present tense expresses habitual action.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is born of him</span>] Literally, <span class="ital">hath been begotten from Him</span>. Only he who habitually does righteousness is a true son of the God who is righteous; just as only he who habitually walks in the light has true fellowship with the God who is light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:...">1 John 1:6-7</a>). In a similar spirit S. Paul says, ‘Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.">2 Timothy 2:19</a>). Other signs of Divine birth are <span class="ital">love</span> of the brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.">1 John 4:7</a>) and <span class="ital">faith</span> in Jesus as the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm" title="Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him.">1 John 5:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-12.htm" title="He that has the Son has life; and he that has not the Son of God has not life.">1 John 5:12</a>. God is Love<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There seems to be no serious break in the Epistle from this point onwards until we reach the concluding verses which form a sort of summary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God....">1 John 5:13-21</a>). The key-word ‘love’ is distributed, and not very unevenly, over the whole, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not.">1 John 3:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-3.htm" title="For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.">1 John 5:3</a>. Subdivisions, however, exist and will be pointed out as they occur. The next two subdivisions may be marked thus; <span class="ital">The Children of God and the Children of the Devil</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm" title="Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.">1 John 3:12</a>); <span class="ital">Love and Hate</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-13.htm" title="Marvel not, my brothers, if the world hate you....">1 John 3:13-24</a>). The two, as we shall find, are closely linked together, and might be placed under one heading, thus; <span class="ital">The Righteousness of the Children of God in their relation to the Hate of the World</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_john/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐὰν εἰδῆτε</span>, <span class="ital">if ye know</span>) From the mention of the future <span class="ital">manifestation</span> of the Son and the sons of God, he derives a new discussion on sin and righteousness.—<span class="greekheb">δίκαιός ἐστι</span>) Jesus Christ <span class="ital">is Righteous</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

The coming of Christ suggests the righteousness of Christ; for it is as the righteous Judge that he is coming, and those who would not be ashamed to meet him at his coming must be righteous also. Once more (verse 27) we are in doubt between indicative and imperative: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, in spite of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> and following <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, is probably indicative. To know that God (not Christ; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-25.htm">John 17:25</a>) is righteous is to perceive that every doer of his <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> righteousness is a son of God (not of Christ; we are nowhere in Scripture said to be born of Christ). To partake of that righteousness which is God's nature is proof of birth from him. With <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, compare <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>). Righteousness must be shown in <span class="accented">conduct</span>; mere desire to be righteous will not suffice. And the conduct must be <span class="accented">habitual</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; a single  act of righteousness will not suffice. Note the change from <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. To know (intuitively) that God is righteous is to come to know (by experience) that whoever habitually acts righteously is God's offspring. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>If ye know - ye know (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  - &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>If ye know absolutely that He is righteous, ye perceive that every one, etc. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24</a>.

Against the latter is the fact that men are not said to be born of Christ, but of God; and that to be born of God is a characteristic phrase of John, while to be born of Christ is a phrase which occurs nowhere. On the other hand, the undoubted reference to Christ in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>, would seem to demand a similar reference here. Men are said to abide in Christ as well as in God, and to be born of the Spirit. Westcott's remark is pertinent. "When John thinks of God in relation to men, he never thinks of Him apart from Christ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>); and again, he never thinks of Christ in His human nature without adding the thought of His divine nature. Thus a rapid transition is possible from the one aspect of the Lord's divine-human person to the other."<p>Righteous (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Used by John both of God and of Christ.
