And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that loveth his brother abideth in the light - Has true religion, and enjoys it.<p>And there is none occasion of stumbling in him - Margin, "scandal." Greek, "and there is no stumbling" (or scandal - &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  skandalon - in him.) The word here used, means anything against which one strikes or stumbles; and then a stumbling-block, an impediment, or anything which occasions a fall. Then it is used in a moral or spiritual sense, as denoting that which is the occasion of falling into sin. See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29</a> note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13</a> note. Here it refers to an individual in respect to his treatment of others, and means that there is nothing, so far as he is concerned, to lead him into sin. - Robinson, Lexicon. If he has love to the brethren, he has true religion; and there is, so far as the influence of this shall extend, nothing that will be the occasion of his falling into sin in his conduct toward them, for "love worketh no ill to his neighbor," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>. His course will be just, and upright, and benevolent. He will have no envy toward them in their prosperity, and will not be disposed to detract from their reputation in adversity; he will have no feelings of exultation when they fall, and will not be disposed to take advantage of their misfortunes; and, loving them as brethren, he will be in no respect under temptation to do them wrong. In the bosom of one who loves his brother, the baleful passions of envy, malice, hatred, and uncharitableness, can have no place. At the same time, this love of the brethren would have an important effect on his whole Christian life and walk, for there are few things that will have more influence on a man's character in keeping him from doing wrong, than the love of the good and the pure. He who truly loves good people, will not be likely in any respect to go astray from the paths of virtue. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

"In him who loves there is neither blindness nor occasion of stumbling [to himself]: in him who does not love, there is both blindness and occasion of stumbling. He who hates his brother, is both a stumbling-block to himself, and stumbles against himself and everything within and without; he who loves has an unimpeded path" [Bengel].

As such, and because he is his brother in Christ, and that cordially and sincerely, without hypocrisy and dissimulation, and by love serves him, both in things temporal and spiritual, and so observes the new, and yet old commandment, <p>abideth in the light: it is a plain case, that such a man is in the light of grace, and continues in it; for though it is not his love to the brethren which is the cause of his light, of his being and continuing in it, for that is owing to the spirit of light and knowledge, but on the contrary, light is the cause of his love; yet it is an evidence of it, that by which it is known, as the cause is known by the effect; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>; <p>and there is none occasion of stumbling in him, or "there is no scandal" or "offence in him"; he gives no offence to his brother, or at least, as much as in him lies, he takes care that he gives none; he avoids, as much as can be, putting a stumblingblock, or an occasion to fall, in his brother's way, by the use of things indifferent, or by any other action; nor will he easily take offence at what is said or done unto him, for charity or love is not easily provoked, it suffers long, and bears all things; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; nor does he so much and so frequently transgress the laws of God, and particularly those which regard his neighbour or his brother, and so easily fall into the snares of Satan, because he is in the light, and walks in the light, and sees his way, and what lies in his way, and, so shuns and avoids occasion of stumbling and falling. There is not in him that wrath, and malice, and envy, which lead on to the commission of other sins; for love works no ill, but fulfils the law, and will not suffer him to commit adultery, to kill, to steal, or bear false witness against his neighbour, friend, and brother; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-9.htm">Romans 13:9</a>; and such an one enjoys great peace, tranquillity, and happiness; he has much comfort in himself, and pleasure in the saints, and delight in their company; he walks inoffensively, and in an harmless manner, without hurting himself, or any other, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-165.htm">Psalm 119:165</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-10.htm" title="He that loves his brother stays in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.">1 John 2:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ φωτὶ μένει</span>: he does not merely catch glimpses of the light but “abideth in it,” being of one mind with God, the common Father, who “is light” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a>). <span class="greekheb">σκάνδαλον οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, “there is no occasion of stumbling, nothing to trip him up and make him fall, in his case”—an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

The love of the primitive Christians impressed the heathen. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Tert. <span class="ital">Apol.</span> 39: “Vide, inquiunt, ut invicem se diligant: ipsi enim invicem oderunt; et ut pro alterutro mori sint parati: ipsi enim ad occidendum alterutrum paratiores erunt”. <span class="ital">Ep. ad Diogn.</span> 1: <span class="greekheb">καὶ τίνα φιλοστοργίαν ἔχουσι πρὸς ἀλλήλους</span>. This spirit disappeared, and in view of the bitter controversies of the 4th century the Pagan historian Ammianus avowed that “the enmity of the Christians toward each other surpassed the fury of savage beasts against man”. Another interpretation takes <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span> as neuter: “There is no occasion of stumbling in it,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, in the light. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

He has <span class="ital">in him</span> nothing likely to ensnare <span class="ital">him</span> or cause <span class="ital">him</span> to stumble. 2. He has <span class="ital">in him</span> nothing likely to cause <span class="ital">others</span> to stumble. 3. There is <span class="ital">in his case</span> nothing likely to cause stumbling. 4. <span class="ital">In the light</span> there is nothing likely to cause stumbling;—the Greek for ‘in him’ being either masculine or neuter, and therefore capable of meaning ‘in it’. All make good sense, and the last makes a good antithesis to ‘knoweth not whither he goeth’ in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-11.htm" title="But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.">1 John 2:11</a></span> : but the first is to be preferred on account of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-11.htm" title="But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.">1 John 2:11</a></span>. Yet in favour of the second it is worth noting that <span class="greekheb">σκάνδαλον</span> is commonly, if not always, used of offence caused to <span class="ital">others</span>. The parallel expressions ‘the truth is not in him’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1 John 2:4</a></span>), ‘His word is not in us’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-10.htm" title="If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.">1 John 1:10</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a>), make ‘in him’ more probable than ‘in his case’. And nothing here suggests the notion that the brother-hater leads <span class="ital">others</span> astray: it is his own dark condition that is contemplated. Moreover, there is the very close parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world....">John 11:9-10</a>; ‘If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.

But the notion of the one is supplied from the other: in him who loves, there is neither blindness nor <span class="ital">an occasion of stumbling</span>: in him who does not love, there is both <span class="ital">blindness</span> and an occasion of stumbling. He who hates his brother, is a stumbling-block to himself, and stumbles against himself and everything within and without: he who loves, has a path free from obstacles.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Whereas he who loves his brother has not only entered the region or' light, but has <span class="accented">made it his home:</span> he abideth in the light. It is difficult to determine whether the "occasion of stumbling" <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is in reference to himself or to others. The context here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm">John 11:9, 10</a> are in favour of the former. It is a man's own salvation that is under consideration here, not his influence over others: and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> seems exactly parallel. To have no light in one is to be in danger of stumbling; to have light in one is to have no occasion of stumbling (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>, which is very parallel). But elsewhere in the New Testament <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> means a stumbling-block or snare in <span class="accented">another's</span> way, not in one's <span class="accented">own</span> way; and this makes sense here. There is yet a third explanation. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> may mean "in it," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "in the <span class="accented">light</span> there is no occasion of stumbling." This makes a good antithesis to the close of verse 11, "knoweth not whither he goeth." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Abideth (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a>.
