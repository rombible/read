And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that saith, I know Him - He who professes to be acquainted with the Saviour, or who professes to be a Christian.<p>And keepeth not his commandments - What he has appointed to be observed by his people; that is, he who does not obey him.<p>Is a liar - Makes a false profession; professes to have that which he really has not.

Without reason, Braune considers that “in the singular there lies a progress in the development of the thought.” The statement that <span class="greekheb">ἔγνωκα</span> is used “with manifest regard to the <span class="ital">Gnostics</span>” (Ebrard), is not to be accepted; <span class="greekheb">ὁ λέγων</span> is rather to be taken in a quite general sense, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1 John 2:6</a>, at the same time referring to the appearance of such a moral indifferentism among the churches, <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1 John 2:3</a> = <span class="greekheb">Θεόν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ψεύστης ἐστί</span>] = <span class="greekheb">ψεύδεται</span>, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>; but in such a way that the idea is more sharply brought out by it (Braune).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐν τούτῳ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] as in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From the connection between the knowledge of God and the observance of His commandments, it follows that he who boasts of the former, but is wanting in the latter, has not the truth in him, but is a liar.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1 John 2:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">μὴ τηρῶν</span>, in classical Greek a gentle hypothesis, merely suggesting a possible case; but in later Greek <span class="greekheb">μή</span> is the regular negative with participles.

The previous statement is enforced by denying the opposite of it. The construction, ‘he that saith,’ ‘he that loveth,’ &c. now takes the place of ‘if we say,’ ‘if we walk,’ &c., but without change of meaning; and this continues down to <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-11.htm" title="But he that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not where he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes.">1 John 2:11</a></span>, after which both constructions cease and a new division begins.

John states the case as gently as possible, without asserting that any such person exists (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-10.htm" title="He that loves his brother stays in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.">1 John 2:10</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The participial substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> now takes the place of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> with the subjunctive, but the two are equivalent (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>, which is almost exactly parallel to this, and shows what "knowing him" really is, viz. having fellowship with him, just as not keeping his commandments is the same as walking in darkness). St. John says, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, not, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the case being hypothetical - if there be such a man, he is a liar, and has no idea of truth (see on 1 John 1:8).
