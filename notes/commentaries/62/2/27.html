What value should we put upon gospel truth! Thereby the promise of eternal life is made sure. The promise God makes, is suitable to his own greatness, power, and goodness; it is eternal life. The Spirit of truth will not lie; and he teaches all things in the present dispensation, all things necessary to our knowledge of God in Christ, and their glory in the gospel. The apostle repeats the kind words, little children; which denotes his affection. He would persuade by love. Gospel privileges oblige to gospel duties; and those anointed by the Lord Jesus abide with him. The new spiritual nature is from the Lord Christ. He that is constant to the practice of religion in trying times, shows that he is born from above, from the Lord Christ. Then, let us beware of holding the truth in unrighteousness, remembering that those only are born of God, who bear his holy image, and walk in his most righteous ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the anointing which ye have received of him - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>.<p>Abideth in you - The meaning is, that the influence on your heart and life, which results from the fact that you are anointed of God, permanently abides with you, and will keep you from dangerous error. The apostle evidently meant to say that he felt assured that they would not be seduced from the truth, and that his confidence in regard to this was placed in the fact that they had been truly anointed unto God as kings and priests. Thus understood, what he here says is equivalent to the expression of a firm conviction that those who are true Christians will not fall away.

No man was ever led into error by those influences which result from the fact that he has been consecrated to the service of God.<p>Ye shall abide in him - Margin, "or it."

Nor was that knowledge which they had of those necessary things to be thought the effect of an immediate inspiration, but such as by ordinary external means they had already learned, but made vital and efficacious by the special sanctifying influence and operation of the Holy Ghost; who having begotten in them a correspondent impress to those great truths which are after godliness, formed the new creature in them, which is begotten of the word of truth, had made them capable of dijudication, or of distinguishing by a spiritual sense, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm" title="And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;">Philippians 1:9</a>,10</span>, between things that were grateful, suitable, and nutritive to the life of the new creature in them, and such things as were noxious and offensive. Whereas, in reference to things more remote from the vitals of religion and godliness, none can assure themselves of such a privilege. And as to these, they are to expect it in the way of their own sincere and diligent endeavours and prayers, as the effect of the habit of grace, maintained and kept up in life and vigour; and a reward of their sincere resignation and subjection of heart and soul to the governing power of truth, so far as it should be understood and known of them, according to that of our Saviour, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a></span>: <span class="ital">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, </span>& c.

The Spirit, and the grace of the Spirit, which they had received out of the fulness of grace which is in Christ; and is compared to oil or ointment; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>; for Christ, the anointed, is the fountain of it all, and it is had from him in a way of giving and receiving. So the second "Sephira", or number in the Jews' Cabalistic tree, which is wisdom, has for one of its surnames, the fountain of the oil of unction (i) this <p>abideth in you; the Syriac and Arabic versions render it, "if it abideth", which spoils the text, for the words are not conditional, but affirmative: grace is an internal thing, it is oil in the vessel of the heart, and where it once is, it abides; as does every grace of the Spirit, as faith, hope, love, and every other: grace can never be taken away; God will not take it away, where he has once bestowed it, and men and devils cannot; it can never be lost as to the principle and being of it; it is an incorruptible seed, and a living principle, which can never be destroyed, notwithstanding all the corruptions in a man's hart, the pollutions of the world, and the temptations of Satan: <p>and ye need not that any man teach you; not that they were perfect in knowledge, for no man is absolutely, only comparatively so, in this life; or that they needed not, and were above and exempt from the instructions of Christ's faithful servants; for John himself taught them, and to teach and instruct them was the end of his writing this epistle to them; but the sense is either that they needed not the teachings of these men before mentioned, the antichrists, liars, and seducers, being better taught, and having an unction by which they knew all things; or they needed not to be taught as if they were babes in Christ, as unskilful in the word of righteousness, but so as to increase in spiritual knowledge, and go on to perfection, and be established in the present truths, at least so as to be put in remembrance of them; or rather they needed not, nor were they to regard any mere human revelation and doctrine, for the whole Gospel was come by Jesus Christ, and no other is to be expected or received by men, nor any doctrine but what is according to the revelation of Christ; wherefore saints under the Gospel dispensation are taught of God by his Spirit, according to the word of truth, and by the ministry of it, and have no need of learning every man from his neighbour, or from his brother, any separate revelation; so that this passage does not militate against the external ministry of the Gospel, or human teachings according to that perfect rule and declaration of the whole mind and will of God by Christ under the Gospel dispensation: <p>but as the same anointing. The Vulgate Latin and Arabic versions read, "his anointing"; that is, God's or Christ's; and so the Syriac version renders it, "that unction which is of God"; meaning the same as before: the Ethiopic version renders it, his Spirit, which, though not a true version, is no improper or impertinent sense of the phrase: and this <p>teacheth you of all things; truths and doctrines necessary to salvation, as in 1Jo_2:20; <p>and is truth, and is no lie; or true and not a liar; which is a just character of the spirit of truth, in opposition to the spirit of error; and holds good of the grace of the Spirit, which is truth in the inward parts, and is genuine and sincere: <p>and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him; in Christ, from whom they received this anointing; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm">1 John 2:24</a>; or in the anointing itself, in the grace of the Spirit, in which they stood.

The ground of the Apostle’s confidence in his readers. They need not be taught but only reminded. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὡς</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., a single sentence with one apodosis. Vulg. makes it a double sentence with two apodoses: “as His chrism is teaching you regarding all things, it is indeed true and is not a lie; and even as it taught you, abide in Him”. Reading <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>, translate: “ye have no need that any one should teach you, but His chrism is teaching you … a lie; and even as, etc.” <span class="greekheb">διδάσκει</span>, of the continued teaching by the grace of the Spirit; <span class="greekheb">ἐδίδαξεν</span>, of the illumination at the hour of conversion. <span class="greekheb">μένετε</span>, plainly imperat. in next ver., can hardly be indicat. here (“ye are abiding”). The reading <span class="greekheb">μενεῖτε</span> (“ye shall abide”) would express the Apostle’s confidence in the steadfastness of his readers, like “England expects every man to do his duty”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-48.htm" title="Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.">Matthew 5:48</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἔσεσθε οὖν ὑμεῖς τέλειοι</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, <span class="ital">in eo</span> (Vulg), “in Him,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, in Christ and therefore in God (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm" title="Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.">1 John 2:24</a>). According to Aug., “in it,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the chrism, <span class="ital">unctio</span> (<span class="ital">permanete in ipsa</span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>27, 28. The Place of Safety;—Christ<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">But the anointing which ye have received</span>] As in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1 John 2:2</a></span>, we have the false and the true Christians put side by side in contrast; but this does not justify us in turning S. John’s simple ‘and’ (<span class="greekheb">καί</span>) into ‘but’. As in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm" title="Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.">1 John 2:24</a></span>, we have the pronoun put first with great emphasis, and as a <span class="ital">nominativus pendens</span>. Moreover, the reception of the chrism refers to the definite occasion when Christ poured out His Spirit upon them, viz. their baptism; and therefore the aorist should be retained. Wherefore, as R. V., <span class="bld">And as for you</span>, <span class="ital">the anointing which</span> <span class="bld">ye received</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">abideth in you</span>] We often, in order to convey a command or a rebuke gently, state as a fact what ought to be a fact. This is perhaps S. John’s meaning here. If not, it is an expression of strong confidence in those whom he adresses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye need not that any man teach you</span>] This seems to confirm the reading ‘ye know all things’ in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1 John 2:20</a></span>. The believer who has once been anointed with the Spirit of truth has no need even of an Apostle’s teaching. This seems to be quite conclusive against ‘little children’ anywhere in this Epistle meaning children in years or children in knowledge of the Gospel. S. John writes throughout for adult and well-instructed Christians, to whom he writes not to give information, but to confirm and enforce and perhaps develope what they have all along known. Of course S. John does not mean that the anointing with the Spirit supersedes all necessity for instruction. The whole Epistle, and in this chapter <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked....">1 John 2:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm" title="Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.">1 John 2:24</a></span>, are conclusive against such a view. S. John assumes that his readers have been thoroughly instructed in ‘the word’ and ‘the truth’, before receiving the outpouring of the Spirit which shews them the full meaning of ‘the word’ and confirms them in ‘the truth’. If S. John has no sympathy with a knowledge which professed to rise higher than Christian teaching, still less has he sympathy with a fanaticism which would dispense with Christian teaching. While he condemns the Gnosticism of his own age, he gives no encouragement to the Montanism of a century later.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but as the same anointing … ye shall abide in him</span>] We have here to settle, first the question of readings, and then the question of construction. ‘But as His anointing’ (<span class="greekheb">א</span>BC, Vulgate, Syriac) is certainly superior to ‘But as the <span class="ital">same</span> anointing’ (AKL, Coptic), and still more is ‘<span class="ital">ye abide</span>’ or ‘<span class="ital">abide ye</span>’ (<span class="greekheb">א</span>ABC, Versions) superior to ‘ye <span class="ital">shall</span> abide’ (KL). The A. V. deserts Wiclif, Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Rhemish, to follow the Genevan in adopting the future. The construction is not so easily determined, but does not seriously affect the sense. We may render, (1) <span class="ital">But as His anointing teacheth you concerning all things, and is</span> <span class="bld">true</span>, <span class="ital">and is no lie, and even as</span> <span class="bld">it taught</span> <span class="ital">you</span>,—<span class="bld">do ye abide</span> <span class="ital">in Him</span>; making only one sentence with a long protasis. Or (2) we may break it into two sentences, each with a protasis and apodosis; <span class="ital">But as His anointing teacheth you concerning all things, it is</span> <span class="bld">true</span> <span class="ital">and is no lie; and even as</span> <span class="bld">it taught</span> <span class="ital">you</span>, <span class="bld">do ye abide</span> <span class="ital">in Him</span>, The majority of English Versions, including R.V., are for the former: so also the Vulgate. Commentators are much divided; but Huther claims to have most on his side for the latter. He has against him Alford, Braune, De Wette, Düsterdieck, Ewald, Lücke, Neander, Westcott. The sentence seems to be a recapitulation of the section. ‘As His anointing teaches you concerning all things’ recalls <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1 John 2:20</a></span>; ‘is true and is no lie’ recalls <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-21.htm" title="I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth....">1 John 2:21-23</a></span>; ‘do ye abide in Him’ recalls <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-24.htm" title="Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father....">1 John 2:24-25</a></span>. Probably we ought to supply a new nominative for ‘taught’, viz. ‘He’, i.e. Christ understood from ‘in Him’. This explains the difference of tense: ‘taught’ refers to the gift of the Spirit of truth made once for all by Christ; ‘teacheth’ to the continual illumination which is the result of the gift. It is comparatively unimportant whether we consider ‘do ye abide’ (<span class="greekheb">μένετε</span>) as indicative, like ‘abideth’ just before, or as imperative, like ‘abide’ in the next verse. See on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a></span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_john/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καί ὑμεῖς</span>, <span class="ital">and ye</span>) On this depends <span class="ital">ye have no need</span>; a befitting transposition.[5]—<span class="greekheb">ἘΛΆΒΕΤΕ ἈΠʼ ΑὐΤΟῦ</span>, <span class="ital">ye have received from Him</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.">John 1:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν μένει</span>, <span class="ital">abides in you</span>) This indicative implies a very subtle exhortation (to be compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-14.htm" title="But continue you in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them;">2 Timothy 3:14</a>), by which he makes the faithful, when harassed by deceivers, thus to answer them: <span class="ital">The anointing abideth in us: we do not need a teacher: it teaches us the truth: in that doctrine we will continue</span>. See how pleasant the transition is from this introduction of the language of another speaker[6] to the direct address, in the following verse. <span class="ital">Abides in you, ye shall abide in Him</span>, are correlative expressions.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>) <span class="ital">and</span> therefore.—<span class="greekheb">οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε</span>, <span class="ital">ye have no need</span>) A phrase indicative of character (or <span class="ital">of courtesy</span>), expressing the repulse of the faithful directed against deceivers. <span class="greekheb">Αὐτάρκεια θεοδιδάκτων</span>· <span class="ital">They who are taught of God have a sufficiency in themselves</span>.

If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.">1 John 2:24</a>. This Future has the force of consolation and exhortation. The whole discourse brought down from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a> to this verse, is most pleasantly adapted to young children, and in particular the mention of <span class="ital">teaching</span> and <span class="ital">anointing</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[5] See Append. on HYPERBATON.—E.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[6] See Append. on SERMOCINATIO.—E.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - Parallel to verse 24, but stating as a fact what is there given as a command. The emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> again marks the emphatic contrast between St. John's readers and the antichrists. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> means "from Christ" (verse 20). The indicative <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> states what <span class="accented">ought</span> to be true of them, and is a delicate equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> (verse 24). The anointing of Christ <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> abides with them as a permanent gift, and renders further apostolic teaching unnecessary. It is quite a mistake to suppose that the superfluous teaching refers to the antichrists. The ideal to which the Christian must aspire is the being led into all truth by the Spirit; he will need no human teachers then (see the remarkable parallel to this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, and the quotation of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10, 11</a>). The construction in the middle of the verse is amphibolous. We may take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;</span> either as the apodosis of <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c2;</span> ("as his anointing teacheth you...  so it is true") or as a continuation of the protasis, which is resumed by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> ("as his anointing teacheth you...  and is true...  and even as"). Thereafter is better. The emphatic "and is no lie" is thoroughly Johannine (see on verse 23). The conclusion of the verse is doubtful also. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is certainly preferable to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>; but <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> may be indicative like <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> in the first clause, or imperative like <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in the next verse. The latter is more probable. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>As for you (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Emphatic, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm">1 John 2:24</a>.<p>Of Him (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;' &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>.<p>The same anointing (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;)<p>The best texts read &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, His anointing.<p>Is truth, and is no lie<p>The characteristic combination of positive and negative statement.
