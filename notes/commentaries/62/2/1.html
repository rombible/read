It is the doctrine of Reconciliation and Redemption. St. John does not wish them to contemplate with complacency the probability of sinning; but to remember gratefully, in spite of falls, that the Author and Restorer of Light has provided a remedy both for the offence before God, and for its effect on themselves. First comes the principle that we must not sin; second, the admission that we do sin; third, the consolation for actual sin when it is in spite of sincere zeal for sanctification.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">My little children.</span>—Six times in the letter occurs this diminutive of tender and caressing love: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.">1John 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1John 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm" title="My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.">1John 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm" title="You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.">1John 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm" title="Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.">1John 5:21</a>. He was aged, he felt a fatherly care for them, he was their spiritual progenitor. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>.) The thought of the shame and misery of sin melted his heart. “My child” was what he called out to the lapsed youth, according to Eusebius (<span class= "ital">H. E.</span> iii. 23).<p><span class= "bld">These things.</span>—He carries them on through the former points up to the new thought.<p><span class= "bld">That ye sin not.</span>—Another side of the object of the teaching: their joy could not be full unless they were earnest against sin.

It has two meanings; one, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm" title="I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are you all.">Job 16:2</a>, he who comforts, or exhorts; the other, as here, he who is appealed to—a proxy, or attorney. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-26.htm" title="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.">Romans 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/4-14.htm" title="Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>.) The Redeemer, the Word made flesh, and reascended with His human nature, is that part of the Deity which assures us of the ever-active vitality of divine love. If the justice of God is connected most with the Father, the mercy is pledged by the Son. He has exalted our nature, undertaken our interests, presents our prayers, and will one day be surrounded by the countless millions of His human brothers whom He has rescued, wearing the same nature as Himself. He is represented as continuing our advocate, because otherwise His work might appear a mere separate earthly manifestation; “righteous,” because Christ, the only blameless example of human nature, can alone intercede for it with God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8-10</a>). The Armenian translation actually adds “and blameless.” Augustine remarks that St. John did not set forth any apostle or saint as intercessor (here, if anywhere, he would have done so), but only Christ. “We” is not the Church corporately, but merely another instance of St. John’s kindly delicacy, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1John 1:6</a>, &c.<p>(2) <span class= "bld">And he is the propitiation for our sins.</span>—On the word “propitiation,” see the Introduction.

Its scope is that Christ’s redemption was offered for the whole of mankind, from Adam to the last man. Who lay hold of the redemption, must be determined on other considerations. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-14.htm" title="And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Savior of the world.">1John 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-42.htm" title="And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.">John 4:42</a>.)

St. John’s object in introducing this truth here is to rebuke the arrogance of those Christians who looked down on the non-Christian world as outside the Fatherhood and mercies of God. Such an error might be seen, for example, in the heated partisanship of a Crusader or persecutor for a civilisation politically Christian against one outside his own sympathies.

It is a tender and affectionate appellation, denoting paternal authority, love, and concern, which, in the character of an apostle, St. John might have used in any period of his life; but as used in this epistle, it seems to imply, together with apostolical authority, the apostle’s advanced age. It is a different word from that which is translated <span class="ital">little children, </span>in several parts of the epistle, to distinguish it from which, it may here be rendered <span class="ital">beloved children. These things write I unto you, that ye sin not </span>— Thus he guards them beforehand against abusing the doctrine of reconciliation.

He is Jesus, the Saviour, and Christ, the Messiah, the Anointed. He alone is the Righteous One, who received his nature pure from sin, and as our Surety perfectly obeyed the law of God, and so fulfilled all righteousness. All men, in every land, and through successive generations, are invited to come to God through this all-sufficient atonement, and by this new and living way. The gospel, when rightly understood and received, sets the heart against all sin, and stops the allowed practice of it; at the same time it gives blessed relief to the wounded consciences of those who have sinned.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My little children - &#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;  Teknia mou. This is such language as an aged apostle would be likely to use when addressing a church, and its use in this Epistle may be regarded as one evidence that John had reached an advanced period of life when he wrote the Epistle.<p>These things write I unto you - To wit, the things stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>.<p>That ye sin not - To keep you from sin, or to induce you to lead a holy life.<p>And if any man sin - As all are liable, with hearts as corrupt as ours, and amidst the temptations of a world like this, to do. This, of course, does not imply that it is proper or right to sin, or that Christians should have no concern about it; but the meaning is, that all are liable to sin, and when we are conscious of sin the mind should not yield to despondency and despair. It might be supposed, perhaps, that if one sinned after baptism, or after being converted, there could be no forgiveness. The apostle designs to guard against any such supposition, and to show that the atonement made by the Redeemer had respect to all kinds of sin, and that under the deepest consciousness of guilt and of personal unworthiness, we may feel that we have an advocate on high.<p>We have an advocate with the Father - God only can forgive sin; and though we have no claim on him, yet there is one with him who can plead our cause, and on whom we can rely to manage our interests there. The word rendered "advocate" (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  parakle&#772;tos - paraclete) is elsewhere applied to the Holy Spirit, and is in every other place where it occurs in the New Testament rendered "comforter," <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>. On the meaning of the word, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>. As used with reference to the Holy Spirit (<a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>, et al.) it is employed in the more general sense of "helper," or "aid;" and the particular manner in which the Holy Spirit aids us, may be seen stated in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>. As usual here with reference to the Lord Jesus, it is employed in the more limited sense of the word "advocate," as the word is frequently used in the Greek writers to denote an advocate in court; that is, one whom we call to our aid; or to stand by us, to defend our suit. Where it is applied to the Lord Jesus, the language is evidently figurative, since there can be no literal pleading for us in heaven; but it is expressive of the great truth that he has undertaken our cause with God, and that he performs for us all that we expect of an advocate and counselor. It is not to be supposed, however, that he manages our cause in the same way, or on the same principles on which an advocate in a human tribunal does. An advocate in court is employed to defend his client. He does not begin by admitting his guilt, or in any way basing his plea on the conceded fact that he is guilty; his proper business is to show that he is not guilty, or, if he be proved to be so, to see that no injustice shall be done him. The proper business of an advocate in a human court, therefore, embraces two things:<p>(1) To show that his client is not guilty in the form and manner charged on him. This he may do in one of two ways, either,<p>(a) by showing that he did not do the act charged on him, as when he is charged with murder, and can prove an alibi, or show that he was not present at the time the murder was committed; or,<p>(b) by proving that he had a right to do the deed - as, if he is charged with murder, he may admit the fact of the killing, but may show that it was in self-defense.<p>(2) In case his client is convicted, his office is to see that no injustice is done to him in the sentence; to stand by him still; to avail himself of all that the law allows in his favor, or to state any circumstance of age, or sex, or former service, or bodily health, which would in any way mitigate the sentence.<p>The advocacy of the Lord Jesus in our behalf, however, is wholly different from this, though the same general object is pursued and sought, the good of those for whom he becomes an advocate. The nature of his advocacy may be stated in the following particulars:<p>(1) He admits the guilt of those for whom he becomes the advocate, to the full extent charged on them by the law of God, and by their own consciences. He does not attempt to hide or conceal it. He makes no apology for it. He neither attempts to deny the fact, nor to show that they had a right to do as they have done. He could not do this, for it would not be true; and any plea before the throne of God which should be based on a denial of our guilt would be fatal to our cause.<p>(2) as our advocate, he undertakes to be security that no wrong shall be done to the universe if we are not punished as we deserve; that is, if we are pardoned, and treated as if we had not sinned. This he does by pleading what he has done in behalf of people; that is, by the plea that his sufferings and death in behalf of sinners have done as much to honor the law, and to maintain the truth and justice of God, and to prevent the extension of apostasy, as if the offenders themselves had suffered the full penalty of the law. If sinners are punished in hell, there will be some object to be accomplished by it; and the simple account of the atonement by Christ is, that his death will secure all the good results to the universe which would be secured by the punishment of the offender himself. It has done as much to maintain the honor of the law, and to impress the universe with the truth that sin cannot be committed with impunity. If all the good results can be secured by substituted sufferings which there would be by the punishment of the offender himself, then it is clear that the guilty may be acquitted and saved. Why should they not be? The Saviour, as our advocate, undertakes to be security that this shall be.<p>(3) as our advocate, he becomes a surety for our good behavior; gives a pledge to justice that we will obey the laws of God, and that he will keep us in the paths of obedience and truth; that, if pardoned, we will not continue to rebel. This pledge or surety can be given in no human court of justice. No man, advocate or friend can give security when one is pardoned who has been convicted of stealing a horse, that he will not steal a horse again; when one who has been guilty of murder is pardoned, that he will never be guilty of it again; when one who has been guilty of forgery is pardoned, that he will not be guilty of it again. If he could do this, the subject of pardon would be attended with much fewer difficulties than it is now. But the Lord Jesus becomes such a pledge or surety for us, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>, and hence he becomes such an advocate with the Father as we need.<p>Jesus Christ the righteous - One who is eminently righteous himself, and who possesses the means of rendering others righteous. It is an appropriate feeling when we come before God in his name, that we come pleading the merits of one who is eminently righteous, and on account of whose righteousness we may be justified and saved. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>1Jo 2:1-29. The Advocacy of Christ Is Our Antidote to Sin While Walking in the Light; for to Know God, We Must Keep His Commandments and Love the Brethren, and Not Love the World, Nor Give Heed to Antichrists, against Whom Our Safety Is through the Inward Anointing of God to Abide in God: So at Christ's Coming We Shall Not Be Ashamed.<p>1. (1Jo 5:18.)<p>My little children&#8212;The diminutive expresses the tender affection of an aged pastor and spiritual father. My own dear children, that is, sons and daughters (see on [2639]1Jo 2:12).<p>these things&#8212;(1Jo 1:6-10). My purpose in writing what I have just written is not that you should abuse them as giving a license to sin but, on the contrary, "in order that ye may not sin at all" (the Greek aorist, implying the absence not only of the habit, but of single acts of sin [Alford]). In order to "walk in the light" (1Jo 1:5, 7), the first step is confession of sin (1Jo 1:9), the next (1Jo 2:1) is that we should forsake all sin. The divine purpose has for its aim, either to prevent the commission of, or to destroy sin [Bengel].<p>And, &c.&#8212;connected with the former; Furthermore, "if any man sin," let him, while loathing and condemning it, not fear to go at once to God, the Judge, confessing it, for "we have an Advocate with Him." He is speaking of a BELIEVER'S occasional sins of infirmity through Satan's fraud and malice. The use of "we" immediately afterwards implies that we all are liable to this, though not necessarily constrained to sin.<p>we have an advocate&#8212;Advocacy is God's family blessing; other blessings He grants to good and bad alike, but justification, sanctification, continued intercession, and peace, He grants to His children alone.<p>advocate&#8212;Greek, "paraclete," the same term as is applied to the Holy Ghost, as the "other Comforter"; showing the unity of the Second and Third Persons of the Trinity. Christ is the Intercessor for us above; and, in His absence, here below the Holy Ghost is the other Intercessor in us. Christ's advocacy is inseparable from the Holy Spirit's comfort and working in us, as the spirit of intercessory prayer.<p>righteous&#8212;As our "advocate," Christ is not a mere suppliant petitioner. He pleads for us on the ground of justice, or righteousness, as well as mercy. Though He can say nothing good of us, He can say much for us. It is His righteousness, or obedience to the law, and endurance of its full penalty for us, on which He grounds His claim for our acquittal. The sense therefore is, "in that He is righteous"; in contrast to our sin ("if any man sin"). The Father, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right, has once for all accepted Christ's claim for us. Therefore the accuser's charges against God's children are vain.

The apostle may address the saints under this character, on account of their regeneration by the Spirit and grace of God, in which they were as newborn babes; and on account of his being the instrument of their conversion, and so was their spiritual father, and therefore calls them his own children; and he might the rather use such a way of speaking, because of his advanced age, being now in his old age, and John the elder in age as well as in office; as well as to show his paternal affection for them, and care of them, and that what he had wrote, or should write, was not from any disrespect, but from pure love to them; and it might serve to put them in mind of their weakness in faith, in knowledge, and spiritual strength, that they might not entertain high notions of themselves, as if they were perfect and without infirmities; and it is easy to observe, that this is one of Christ's expressions, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>, from whose lips the apostle took it, whose words and phrases he greatly delighted in, as he seems to do in this, by his frequent use of it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>. <p>These things write I unto you; concerning the purity and holiness of God, who is light itself; concerning fellowship with him, which no one that lives in sin can have; concerning pardon and cleansing from sin by the blood of Christ, and concerning sin being in them, and they not without it. The Ethiopic version reads, "we write", as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-4.htm">1 John 1:4</a>; <p>that ye sin not; not that he thought they could be entirely without it, either without the being of it, or the commission of it, in thought, word, or deed, for this would be to suppose that which is contrary to his own words, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>; but he suggests that the end of his writing on these subjects was, that they might not live in sin, and indulge themselves in a vicious course of living, give up themselves to it, and walk in it, and work it with all greediness: and nothing could be more suitably adapted to such an end than the consideration of the holiness of God, who calls by his grace; and of the necessity of light and grace and holiness in men to communion with him; and of the pardoning grace of God and cleansing blood of Christ, which, when savingly applied, sets men against sin, and makes them zealous of good works; and of the indwelling of sin in the saints, which puts them upon their guard against it: <p>and if any man sin; as every man does, even everyone that is in the light, and walks in it, and has fellowship with God; everyone that believes in Christ, and is justified through his righteousness, and pardoned by his blood; everyone of the little children; for the apostle is not speaking of mankind in general who sin, for Christ is not an advocate for all that sin, but of these in particular; hence the Arabic version renders it, "if any of you sin"; and this, with the following, he says not to encourage in sin, but to comfort under a sense of it: <p>we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; Christ is an advocate, not for just or righteous persons, for as he came not to call these to repentance, nor to die for them, so such have no need of an advocate, nor is he one for them; but as he came to call sinners, and to save them, and died for them, the just for the unjust, so he is an advocate, and makes intercession for transgressors; and not for all men, though they have all sinned; not for the world, or those so called in distinction from the persons given him by his Father, for these he prays not; but for all the elect, and whatsoever charges are brought against them he answers to them, and for them; and for all that believe in him, be they weak or strong, even for the apostles as well as others; for they were not without sin, were men of like passions as others, and carried about with them a body of sin, and had their daily infirmities, and so needed an advocate as others; and hence John says, "we have an advocate", &amp;c. but then Christ is not an advocate for sin, though for sinners; he does not vindicate the commission of sin, or plead for the performance of it; he is no patron of iniquity; nor does he deny that his clients have sinned, or affirm that their actions are not sins; he allows in court all their sins, with all their aggravated circumstances; nor does he go about to excuse or extenuate them; but he is an advocate for the non-imputation of them, and for the application of pardon to them: he pleads in their favour, that these sins have been laid upon him, and he has bore them; that his blood has been shed for the remission of them, and that he has made full satisfaction for them; and therefore in justice they ought not to be laid to their charge; but that the forgiveness of them should be applied unto them, for the relief and comfort of their burdened and distressed consciences: and for this he is an advocate for his poor sinning people "with the Father"; who being the first Person, and the Son the advocate, and the Spirit sustaining a like character, is only mentioned; and he being God against whom sin is committed, and to whom the satisfaction is made; and the rather, as he is the Father of Christ, and of those for whom he is an advocate; seeing it may be concluded that his pleadings will be with success, since he is not only related to him, and has an interest in him himself, but the persons also, whose patron he is, are related to him, and have a share in his paternal affection and care: moreover, this phrase, as it expresses the distinct personality of Christ from the Father, so his being with him in heaven at his right hand, and nearness to him; where he discharges this office of his, partly by appearing in person for his people in the presence of God; and partly by carrying in and presenting their confessions of sin, and their prayers for the fresh discoveries and applications of pardoning grace, which he offers up to his Father with the sweet incense of his mediation; and chiefly by pleading the virtue of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, which are carried within the vail, and are always in sight, and call aloud for peace and pardon; as also by answering and removing the charges and accusations of the court adversary, the accuser of the brethren, the devil; as well as by the declarations of his will, demanding in point of justice, in consideration of his sufferings and death, that such and such blessings be bestowed upon his people, as pardon, righteousness, grace, and supplies of grace, and at last glory; and by applying these benefits to their souls as a "comforter", which the word here used also signifies, and is so rendered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>; and by the Arabic version here. Now the saints have but one advocate, and that is enough for them; the apostle does not say we have advocates, but "an advocate"; not angels, nor saints departed, but Jesus Christ only, who is the one Mediator between God and man, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, and he is a continual one, he ever lives to make intercession; his blood is always speaking, and he always pleading; and therefore it is said "we have", not we have had, or we shall have an advocate and he is a prevalent one, he is always heard, he thoroughly pleads the cause he undertakes, and ever carries it; which is owing to the dignity of his person, his interest with his Father, and the virtue and value of his sacrifice: and he every way fit for such a work, for he is "righteous"; not only in his natures, both divine and human, but in his office, as Mediator, which he faithfully and righteously performs; he is a very proper person to plead for guilty persons, which he could not do if he himself was guilty; but he is so holy and righteous that nothing can be objected to him by God; and it need not be doubted by men that he will act the faithful part to them, and righteously serve them and their cause; and it is moreover his righteousness which he has wrought out, and is imputed to them, that carries the cause for them; and therefore this character of Christ fitly added, as is also the following. The Jews (i) have adopted the word in the text into their language, but have applied it to a different purpose, to alms deeds, repentance, and good works. Much more agreeably Philo the Jew (k) speaks of the son of perfect virtue,  "as an advocate" for the forgiveness of sins, and for a supply of everlasting good things. <p>(i) Pirke Abot, c. 4. sect. 11.

John chooses this form of address: tum propter aetatem suam, tum propter paternam curam, et affectum (Hornejus). In regard to the verbal form, Lorinus rightly says: diminutiva nomina teneri ac blandientis sunt amoris signa. The Apostle Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>, uses the same form of address, with special reference to the spiritual fatherhood in which he stood toward his readers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ταῦτα γράφω ὑμῖν</span>] <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> is referred by Bengel to what follows, by Grotius to what follows and what precedes, by most commentators (Lücke, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette, Sander, Düsterdieck, Braune), correctly, to the latter only; it refers, however, not merely to the truth expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1 John 2:6</a>, normerely to the “exhortation to self-knowledge and penitence” (de Wette) which is contained in the preceding, nor merely to the statement about forgiveness and cleansing; but to the “whole in its vivid harmony” (Düsterdieck, so also Braune).[76]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ ἁμάρτητε</span>] Statement of the object for which the apostle wrote what precedes; the direction which Calvin gives it: ne quis putet eum peccandi licentiam dare, quum de misericordia Dei concionatur, which is also found in Augustin, Bede, Calov, Bengel, Hornejus, Düsterdieck, Ewald, etc., is incorrect, since the sternness of the apostle against sin has already been sharply and definitely expressed, and the context, in which the subject previously was the forgiveness of sin, would not permit such a supposition to arise at all.[77]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἘΆΝ ΤΙς ἉΜΆΡΤῌ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> is neither = “however” (Baumgarten-Crusius), nor = <span class="ital">sed</span> (Vulg.); it connects as simple copula a new thought with the preceding one. By <span class="greekheb">ἐά<span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ν</span></span></span> the possibility of sinning is admitted; Calvin incorrectly explains it: Conditionalis particula “si quis” debet in causalem resolvi; nam fieri non potest quin peccemus. Whether it is possible for the Christian <span class="ital">not</span> to sin, John does not say. Under the influence of the new spirit of life which is communicated to the believer he cannot sin; but, at the same time, in his internal and external mechanism there lies for him the possibility of sinning—and it is this which the apostle has in view. Socinus perverts the idea of the apostle when he interprets: si quis peccat i. e. post Christum agnitum et professionem nominis ipsius adhuc in peccatis manet, necdum resipuit, etc.; for, on the one hand, the true Christian may indeed sin, but cannot remain in his sins; and, on the other hand, Christ is not the <span class="greekheb">παράκλητος</span> for him who remains in his sins. Besser correctly: “If any man sin—not with wilful doing of sin, but in spite of the will in his mind, which says <span class="ital">no</span> to sin.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">παράκλητον ἔχομεν πρὸς τὸν πατέρα</span>] From the 1st pers. plur. it follows that the preceding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΙς</span></span></span> is used quite generally; the apostle is speaking communicatively, and does not wish himself to be considered excluded.[78] It is unnecessary for the connection of this sentence to supply: “let him know that,” or: “let him comfort himself with the thought that,” or any similar expression; for it is precisely through the <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτάνειν</span> of believers that Christ is induced to be their Paraclete. The verb <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΧΕΙΝ</span></span></span> indicates that Christ belongs to believers.[79]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΆΚΛΗΤΟς</span></span></span> has both a general and a special forensic meaning; in the former, in which it is = “assister,” or “helper,” it is used in Gospel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7</a>, where the Holy Ghost is so called because by His witness He leads the disciples into all truth; see Meyer on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>;[80] here, on the other hand, it is used in its forensic meaning = “advocatus, patronus causae,” or even more special = “intercessor,” and is in close connection with the following <span class="greekheb">ἱλασμός</span>, and refers back to the <span class="greekheb">ἀφιέναι</span> and <span class="greekheb">καθαρίζειν</span> of chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>; so that in Christ the typical action of the high priest interceding for the people has reached its complete fulfilment. The idea of the apostle therefore is—as almost all commentators recognise[81]—the same as is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a> (<span class="greekheb">ὃς καὶ ἐντυγχάνει ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν</span>), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸΣῆΛΘΕΝ Ὁ ΧΡΙΣΤῸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΕἸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΤῸΝ ΟὐΡΑΝΌΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΝῦΝ ἘΜΦΑΝΙΣΘῆΝΑΙ Τῷ ΠΡΟΣΏΠῼ ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ ὙΠῈΡ ἩΜῶΝ</span></span></span>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>.[82]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῸς ΤῸΝ ΠΑΤΈΡΑ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ΠΡΌς</span></span></span> in the same sense as chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>God is called <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΤΉΡ</span></span></span>, because the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΆΚΛΗΤΟς</span></span></span> is the Son of God, and we also (believing Christians) have become through Him <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΈΚΝΑ ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not....">1 John 3:1-2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἸΗΣΟῦΝ ΧΡΙΣΤῸΝ ΔΊΚΑΙΟΝ</span></span></span>] Christ is the Paraclete, not as the Logos, but as the <span class="ital">incarnate</span> Logos, who has shed His <span class="greekheb">αἷμα</span> (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-7.htm" title="But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleans us from all sin.">1 John 1:7</a>) for the atonement,—and indeed inasmuch as He is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΊΚΑΙΟς</span>; <span class="greekheb">ΔΊΚΑΙΟς</span></span></span> is here also neither = lenis et bonus (Grotius), nor = <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙῶΝ</span></span></span> (see Wolf on this passage); but neither is it = fidelis atque verax, quatenus id praestat quod promisit, se scilicet suis adfuturum (Socinus); according to the usus loquendi, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΊΚΑΙΟς</span></span></span> could be understood of (judicial) justice (Bede: justus advocatus, injustas causas non suscipit), but then the adjective would have had to be put with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΆΚΛΗΤΟΝ</span></span></span>; Ebrard incorrectly explains it = <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΊΚΑΙΟς ΚΑῚ ΔΙΚΑΙῶΝ</span></span></span>; but this explanation is so much the more unwarrantable, as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟῦΝ</span></span></span> is the very business of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΆΚΛΗΤΟς</span></span></span>; by the epithet <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΊΚΑΙΟς</span></span></span>, Christ is held up before the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΆΝΟΥΣΙ</span></span></span> as one who by His nature is fitted to be the Paraclete of sinners, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> as one who perfectly satisfies the will of God; who is “just and stainless, and without sin” (Luther). “Only as the Holy One, in whom the holy ideal of manhood is seen realized, can He intercede for sinners with the heavenly Father” (Neander).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[76] Ebrard refers <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> to the two sentences, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:...">1 John 1:6-10</a>, in which these thoughts, involving an apparent contradiction, are contained—(1) “That we must by no means walk in darkness,” and (2) “that we must confess that we have and that we commit sin,” and thinks that this apparent contradiction is solved by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

Preces autem ecclesiae Christus more advocati Deo patri commendat.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[79] Besser: “He has made Himself ours, has given our faith an eternally valid claim on Him.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[80] In the fact that in the Gospel of John the Holy Ghost, but here Christ, is called <span class="greekheb">παράκλητος</span>, there is so much the less a contradiction, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a> it is expressly put: <span class="greekheb">ἄλλον παράκλητον</span>, by which Christ signifies that He Himself is the proper <span class="greekheb">παράκλητος</span>, and the Holy Ghost His substitute.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[81] Ebrard, who here gives the same explanation, explains the expression in the Gospel of John = “Comforter,” <span class="greekheb">ὅς παρακαλεῖ</span> (more correctly <span class="greekheb">παρακαλεῖται</span>, mid.), according to the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">מְנַחֵם</span>, LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-2.htm" title="I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are you all.">Job 16:2</a>; but in this passage it is not <span class="greekheb">παράκλητος</span>, but <span class="greekheb">παρακλήτως</span>, that is used; Hofmann’s explanation is also incorrect (Schriftbew. II. 2, p. 15 ff.) = “Teacher” (comp. Meyer and Hengstenberg on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[82] This idea is not, as it might appear, in contradiction with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-26.htm" title="At that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will pray the Father for you:">John 16:26</a>; for even in this statement a lasting intercession by Christ is indicated, since Christ ascribes the hearing of prayer in His name to Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-13.htm" title="And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.">John 14:13</a>) as well as to the Father.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How Christ executes His office of Advocate with the Father, John does not say; a dogmatic exposition of it is not in place here, still it is important to mark the chief elements which are the result of the apostle’s statement. These are the following:—1. The Paraclete is <span class="ital">Jesus</span>, the glorified Redeemer who is with the Father; therefore neither His divine nature alone, nor His human nature alone, but the Lord in His divine-human personality. 2. The presupposition is the reconciliation of men with God by His blood. 3. His advocacy has reference to believers, who still sin amid their walking in light; and 4. It is a real activity in which He intercedes for His people (that God may manifest in their forgiveness and sanctification His faithfulness and justice) with God, as His (and their) Father. If these points are observed, on the one hand, there is found in the apostolic statement no ground for a materialistic conception, which Calvin opposes in the following words: obiter notandum est, nimis crasse errare eos, qui patris genibus Christum advolvunt, ut pro nobis oret. Tollendae sunt eiusmodi cogitationes, quae coelesti Christi gloriae derogant;—but neither, on the other hand, is there any justification for doing away with the idea, as not a few commentators have been guilty of. Even Bede has not kept himself free from it, when he says that the advocacy consists in this, that Christ presents Himself as man to God, and prays for us non voce, sed miseratione, and therefore considers the intercessio, not as an actio realis, but only as an actio interpretativa. But the idea is even more done away with, when the intercession is viewed only as the permanent effect of the redemptive work accomplished by Christ in the giving up of His life to the death, which is no doubt the opinion of Baumgarten-Crusius when he says: “The apostles certainly did not think of a special oral intercession, but of an intercession by deed, in His work.”[83] Lücke rightly says: “The meaning of this form of representation is no other than this, that Jesus Christ also in His <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> with the Father continues His work of reconciliation. If Christ were not the eternal Paraclete for us with God, His saving and reconciling work would be limited to His earthly life merely, and in so far could not be regarded as eternal and complete;” but it is not to the point when he further puts it: “Without the eternally active saving and reconciling spirit of Christ, without the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα Χριστοῦ</span>, Christ would not be a perfect, a living Christ;” for John is not here speaking of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> of Christ, but of the personal Christ Himself. The explanation of de Wette, that the advocacy of Christ is the combination of the idea of the glorified and of the suffering Messiah, is also unsatisfactory, because it changes the objective reality into a subjective representation. Neander rightly says: “When Christ is described as the Advocate, this is not to be understood as if only the effects of the work once accomplished by Him were transferred to Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>John considers the living Christ as personally operating in His work, as operating in His glorified position with His Father, with the same holy love with which He accomplished His work on earth as a mediation for sinful man. It is by Him in His divine-human personality that the connection between man, saved and reconciled to God by Him, and God as the Father, is always brought about.” Comp. also Meyer on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a>, and Braune in the fundamental dogmatic ideas of the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[83] Similarly Köstlin (p. 61): “Christ is the eternal <span class="greekheb">παράκλητος</span>; He does not however, pray the Father, but the sense of His office of Advocate is simply this, that for His sake the Father also loves those who believe on Him.” Frommann also (p. 472 ff.) finds in the statement of the apostle only a symbolical form of expression, by which the continuation of the atoning work of Christ in His state of exaltation is indicated.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

Wiclif has ‘litil sones’ as a rendering of the <span class="ital">filioli</span> of the Vulgate; Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Genevan Version all waver between ‘babes’ (which is far too strong) and ‘little children’. Setting aside <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>, where the reading is uncertain, the word occurs only in this Epistle (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.">1 John 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm" title="Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.">1 John 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm" title="My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.">1 John 3:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm" title="You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.">1 John 4:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm" title="Little children, keep yourselves from idols.

You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.">John 13:33</a>). Possibly it is a reminiscence of Christ’s farewell address in John 13. S. John’s conception of the Church is that of a family, in which all are children of God and brethren one of another, but in which also some who are elders stand in a parental relation to the younger brethren. Thus there were families within the family, each with its own father. And who had a better right to consider himself a father than the last surviving Apostle? “The Apostles loved and cherished that name, and all that it implied, and all that illustrated it. They much preferred it to any title which merely indicated an office. It was more spiritual; it was more personal; it asserted better the divine order; it did more to preserve the dignity and sacredness of all domestic relations” (Maurice). Comp. the story of ‘S. John and the Robber’ (p. 24).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">These things</span>] Probably refers to the preceding paragraph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all....">1 John 1:5-10</a>) rather than to what follows. On the one hand they must beware of the spiritual pride which is one of the worst forms of sin: on the other they must not think that he is bidding them acquiesce in a state of sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I write</span>] Henceforward the Apostle uses the more personal and direct first person singular. Only in the Introduction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-4.htm" title="And these things write we to you, that your joy may be full.">1 John 1:4</a>) does he use the apostolic ‘write <span class="ital">we</span>’: contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1 John 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning.

Tyndale’s first edition has ‘that ye should not sin’. That is his aim; to lead them onward to perfect holiness, to perfect likeness to God. Those who are on the one hand warned of their liability to sin, and on the other are told of what cleanses them from sin, are put in the way towards this high ideal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And if any man sin</span>] Or, <span class="ital">have sinned</span> (<span class="ital">peccaverit</span>): S. John is not telling the intending sinner that sin is a light matter; but the penitent sinner that sin is not irremediable. In both sentences ‘sin’ is in the aorist, and implies a definite act, not an habitual state, of sin. We are to avoid not merely a life of sin, but any sin whatever. And not merely the habitual sinner, but he who falls into a single sin, needs and has an Advocate. Sin and its remedy are stated in immediate proximity, just as they are found in life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we have an Advocate</span>] Just as we always have sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a>), so we always have One ready to plead for pardon. S. John does not say ‘<span class="ital">he</span> hath an Advocate’, but ‘<span class="ital">we</span> have’ one: he breaks the logical flow of the sentence rather than seem not to include himself in the need and possession of an Advocate. On Advocate or Paraclete (<span class="greekheb">παράκλητος</span>) see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>. It means one who is <span class="ital">summoned to the side of</span> another, especially to serve as his helper, spokesman (<span class="ital">causae patronus</span>), or intercessor. The word occurs in N.T. only in S. John; here in the Epistle and four times in the Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7</a>). It is unlikely that S. John would use the word in totally different senses in the two writings, especially if the Epistle was written to accompany the Gospel. We must therefore find some meaning which will suit all five passages. Two renderings compete for acceptation, ‘Comforter’ and ‘Advocate’. Both make good sense in the Gospel, and (though there is by no means agreement on the point) ‘Advocate’ makes the best sense. ‘Advocate’ is the only rendering which is at all probable here: it exactly suits, the context. ‘We have a <span class="ital">Comforter</span> with the Father’ would be intolerable. The older English Versions (excepting Taverner, who has ‘spokesman’) all have ‘Advocate’ here; and (excepting the Rhemish, which has ‘Paraclete’) all have ‘Comforter’ in the Gospel: and of course this unanimity influenced the translators of 1611. But ‘Advocates’ as the one rendering which suits all five passages should be adopted throughout. Then we see the full meaning of Christ’s promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>), ‘I will pray the Father, and He shall give you <span class="ital">another</span> Advocate’. Jesus Christ is one Advocate; the Holy Spirit is another. As S. Paul says, ‘the Spirit Himself <span class="ital">maketh intercession for</span> us with groanings which cannot be uttered’: and it is worthy of remark that he uses precisely the same language to express the intercession of the Spirit and the intercession of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-26.htm" title="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered....">Romans 8:26-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-34.htm" title="Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.">Romans 8:34</a>). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm" title="Why he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.">Hebrews 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm" title="For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;">1 Timothy 2:5</a>. Philo’s use of the word ‘Paraclete’ throws considerable light upon its meaning. He often uses it of the high-priest with his breastplate of judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-29.htm" title="And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment on his heart, when he goes in to the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:29</a>) interceding on earth for Israel, and also of the Divine Word or Logos giving efficacy in heaven to the intercession of the priest upon earth: ‘It was necessary that the priest who is consecrated to the Father of the world should employ an <span class="ital">Advocate</span> most perfect in efficacy, even the Son, for the blotting-out of sins and the obtaining of abundant blessings’ (<span class="ital">De Vita Mosis</span>, III. xiv. 155). It is evident that the whole passage—‘the blood of Jesus cleanseth us’, ‘to cleanse us from all unrighteousness’, ‘Advocate’, ‘propitiation’—points back to the Mosaic purifications by the blood of victims, and especially to the intercession of the high-priest with the blood of the bullock and the goat on the Day of Atonement. That great type, S. John affirms, has been fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with the Father</span>] Literally, <span class="ital">towards the Father</span>. The idea is either that of <span class="ital">turning towards</span> in order to <span class="ital">plead</span> with Him; or, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>, <span class="ital">at home</span> with Him, ever before His face. ‘The Father’ rather than ‘God’, to bring out the point that our Advocate is His Son, and that through Him we also are made sons. It is not a stern judge but a loving Father before whom He has to plead.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jesus Christ the righteous</span>] Or, <span class="ital">a righteous one</span>: there is no article in the Greek. But in English ‘the righteous’ comes nearer to the Greek than the apparently more exact ‘a righteous one’. It is as being righteous Himself that He can so well plead with the ‘righteous Father’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-25.htm" title="O righteous Father, the world has not known you: but I have known you, and these have known that you have sent me.">John 17:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>) for those who are not righteous. And, as Bede remarks, “a righteous advocate does not undertake unrighteous causes.” It is the Sinless Man, the perfected and glorified Jesus, who pleads for sinners before the Throne of God. Note that neither in the body of the Epistle, any more than in the body of the Gospel, does S. John speak of Christ as ‘the Word’. In both cases that title is used in the Introduction only. When he speaks of the historic person Jesus Christ, S. John uses the name by which He is known in history. Of the perfect righteousness of this Man S. John has personal knowledge, and he alludes to it repeatedly in this Epistle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

The Apostle is still treating of the condition and conduct of the believer as determined by his walking in the light; there is no break between the two chapters. Having shewn us that even Christians constantly sin, he goes on (1) to point out the remedy for sin, (2) to exhort us not to sin.

The word occurs only once outside this Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>), and it was, perhaps, from Christ's use of it then that St. John adopted it (verses 12, 28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a> the reading is doubtful Cf. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>; in the beautiful story of St. John and the young robber (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' III. 23:17). As distinct from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-13.htm">1 John 2:13, 18</a>), the word seems to imply spiritual fatherhood. <span class="cmt_word">These things</span> (the section, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5-10</a>) <span class="cmt_word">I write to you, that ye may not sin.</span> The aorist forbids the rendering, "continue in sin;" as before, those who are walking in light and yet sin through frailty are addressed. Two apparently contradictory principles have been set forth: you must walk in light; you must confess that you sin. St. John now goes on to reconcile them. I write <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to charge you not to sin; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> [to tell you that] if we sin, we have an Advocate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Instead of understanding "to tell you that," we may take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> as "and yet" - a frequent use in St. John. There are two seemingly opposite truths - sin is wholly alien from the Christian, and the Christian is never wholly free from sin; and St. John struggles to give them their right balance, not in the dialectical manner of St. Paul, but by stating them alternately, side by side, varying the point of view. <span class="cmt_word">We have an Advocate.</span> The possession of the Advocate is as continual <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as of the sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>). Every one feels that "a <span class="accented">Comforter</span> with the Father" is an impossible rendering. But St. John alone uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, four times in his Gospel of the Spirit (see on John 14:16), and once here of Christ. Is it likely that he would use so unusual and important a word <span class="accented">in two different senses</span>, and that in two writings intended as <span class="accented">companions to one another?</span> The rendering "Advocate," necessary here, carries with it the rendering "Advocate" in the Gospel. Moreover, what is the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, if Christ is an <span class="accented">Advocate</span>, but the Spirit a <span class="accented">Comforter?</span> If Christ is one Advocate and the Spirit "another Advocate," all is intelligible. Philo frequently uses <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the high priest as intercessor for the people, and also of the Divine <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. There is a difference, however, between "Paraclete" as used of the Spirit and as used of Christ. It is applied to the Spirit in his relation to the disciples; to Christ in his relation to the Father. Christ is our Advocate <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>: his advocacy <span class="accented">turns towards</span> the Father to propitiate him. And not in vain; for he is himself "righteous." A sinner could not reconcile God to sinners; but a righteous Advocate can, for his character is a warrant for the righteousness of his cause. Thus, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the set-off to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>. One who has sinned needs an advocate; one who has not sinned can best undertake the office. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> at the end, without the article, is gently suggestive of the plea, "Jesus Christ, <span class="accented">a Righteous One."</span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>My little children (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, little child, diminutive of &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; child, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-12.htm">1 John 2:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>.

In the familiar story of John and the young convert who became a robber, it is related that the aged apostle repaired to the robber's haunt, and that the young man, on seeing him, took to flight. John, forgetful of his age, ran after him, crying: "O my son why dost thou fly from me thy father? Thou, an armed man, - I, an old, defenseless one! Have pity upon me! My son, do not fear! There is still hope of life for thee. I wish myself to take the burden of all before Christ. If it is necessary, I will die for thee, as Christ died for us. Stop! Believe! It is Christ who sends me."<p>Iwrite<p>More personal than we write (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-4.htm">1 John 1:4</a>), and thus better suiting the form of address, my little children.<p>If any man sin, we have<p>The change from the indefinite third person, any man, to the first person, we have, is significant. By the we have, John assumes the possibility of sinful acts on the part of Christians, and of himself in common with them, and their common need of the intervention of the divine Advocate. So Augustine: "He said, not 'ye have,' nor 'ye have me,' nor 'ye have Christ himself;' but he put Christ, not himself, and said 'we have,' and not 'ye have.' He preferred to place himself in the number of sinners, so that he might have Christ for his advocate, rather than to put himself as the advocate instead of Christ, and to be found among the proud who are destined to condemnation."<p>An advocate (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>.<p>With the Father (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;)<p>See on with God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>.
