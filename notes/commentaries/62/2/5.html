And a disobedient life shows there is neither religion nor honesty in the professor. The love of God is perfected in him that keeps his commandments. God's grace in him attains its true mark, and produces its sovereign effect as far as may be in this world, and this is man's regeneration; though never absolutely perfect here. Yet this observing Christ's commands, has holiness and excellency which, if universal, would make the earth resemble heaven itself. The command to love one another had been in force from the beginning of the world; but it might be called a new command as given to Christians. It was new in them, as their situation was new in respect of its motives, rules, and obligations. And those who walk in hatred and enmity to believers, remain in a dark state. Christian love teaches us to value our brother's soul, and to dread every thing hurtful to his purity and peace. Where spiritual darkness dwells, in mind, the judgment, and the conscience will be darkened, and will mistake the way to heavenly life. These things demand serious self-examination; and earnest prayer, that God would show us what we are, and whither we are going.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But whoso keepeth his word - That is, what he has spoken or commanded, The term "word" here will include all that he has made known to us as his will in regard to our conduct.<p>In him verily is the love of God perfected - He professes to have the love of God in his heart, and that love receives its completion or filling up by obedience to the will of God. That obedience is the proper carrying out, or the exponent of the love which exists in the heart. Love to the Saviour would be defective without that, for it is never complete without obedience. If this be the true interpretation, then the passage does not make any affirmation about sinless perfection, but it only affirms that if true love exists in the heart, it will be carried out in the life; or that love and obedience are parts of the same thing; that one will be manifested by the other; and that where obedience exists, it is the completion or perfecting of love. Besides, the apostle does not say that either the love or the obedience would be in themselves absolutely perfect; but he says that one cannot fully develop itself without the other.<p>Hereby know we that we are in him - That is, by having in fact such love as shall insure obedience. To be in him, is to be united to him; to be his friends.

This interpretation is required by the context; for “the love of God” appears here in place of the “knowledge of God,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments....">1 John 2:3-4</a>. As in the latter, so in the former also, consists fellowship with God. Both, love and knowledge, are so inseparably connected, and are so essentially one in their principle and nature, that the one is the condition of the other.[96]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The idea <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΕΤΕΛΕΊΩΤΑΙ</span></span></span> is not to be weakened, as in Beza: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΕΛΕΙΟῦΝ</span></span></span> hoc in loco non declarat perfecte aliquid consummare, sed mendacio et simulationi opponitur, ut hoc plane sit, quod dicimus: mettre en exécution; but it is to be taken in its constant meaning: “has been perfected,” as in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.">1 John 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world....">1 John 4:17-18</a>.[97] The objection, that nevertheless no Christian can boast of perfect love to God, does not justify an arbitrary change of meaning. The absolute idea <span class="greekheb">τηρεῖν αὐτοῦ τὸν λόγον</span> demands for its counterpart an idea quite as absolute (so also Brückner).[98] Where the word of God is perfectly fulfilled, there love to God is perfect; in perfect obedience perfect love is shown. That the Christian has not attained this perfection at any moment of his life, but is ever only in a state of progress towards it, is no doubt true; but John is not here considering that aspect (so also Braune).[99]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ γινώσκομεν</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span> refers neither to the thought contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm" title="He that said he stays in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.">1 John 2:6</a> (Socinus, Ewald), nor to <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη</span> … <span class="greekheb">τετελ</span>., but to the keeping of the commandments (so also Düsterdieck, Ebrard, Brückner, Braune). Obedience is the evidence for the knowledge that we are <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ ἐσμεν</span>] The expression signifies the inward fellowship of life (differently <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>); it combines the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span> … <span class="greekheb">τετελ</span>. and the former <span class="greekheb">ἐγνώκαμεν αὐτόν</span>, and is identical with <span class="greekheb">κοινωνίαν ἔχομεν μετʼ αὐτοῦ</span> (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm" title="If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:">1 John 1:6</a>), which it defines in its internal character. The knowledge and love of God is being in God (so also Brückner).[100]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Grotius, who understands <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span> of Christ, enfeeblingly explains: Christi ingenii discipuli sumus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[95] Similarly Besser: “ ‘<span class="ital">The love of God in us</span>’ usually embraces both <span class="ital">God’s</span> love <span class="ital">to us, by which</span>, and <span class="ital">our</span> love <span class="ital">to God, in which</span> we live. This is the case in this passage also.” This interpretation can be just as little grammatically justified as that of Ebrard; neither a <span class="ital">duplicity</span> nor a mutual <span class="ital">relationship</span> is expressed in the phrase <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[96] Grotius, it is true, is not wrong when he says: Amor praesupponit cognitionem; but it is just as correct to say: Cognitio praesupponit amorem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[97] Even Bengel’s interpretation: perfectum regimen nactus et <span class="ital">perfecte cognitus est</span> (viz. amor Dei erga hominem), does not correspond to the idea of the word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[98] Ebrard, it is true, wants the idea <span class="greekheb">τετελείωται</span> to be retained unweakened, but finds himself compelled by his interpretation of <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>. to agree with Beza’s explanation, because “in the case of a <span class="ital">relationship</span> its <span class="ital">perfection</span> is nothing else than its <span class="ital">conclusion.</span>” Ebrard’s opinion, that if <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>. = “love to God,” John must have written <span class="greekheb">τελεία ἐστίν</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">τετελείωται</span>, is—besides being contrary to John’s <span class="ital">usus loquendi</span>—without foundation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[99] In Calvin’s explanation: Si quis objiciat, neminem unquam fuisse repertum, qui Deum ita perfecte diligeret, respondeo: sufficere, modo quisque pro gratiae sibi datae mensura ad hanc perfectionem aspiret, and in that of Socinus: “Est autem perfectio ista earitatis in Deum et obedientia praeceptorum ejus ita intelligenda, ut non omnino requiratur, ne ei quiequam deesse possit, sed tantum ut ejusmodi sit, qua Deus pro sua ingenti erga nos bonitate contentus esse voluit,” limitations are introduced which are foreign to the apostle’s train of thought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[100] In substantial agreement with this Weiss says: “In vv. 3 and 4 it was stated that in the keeping of God’s commandments we recognise that we have known God. If, therefore, there is a continuous train of thought here, the being in God must only be a new expression for the knowing of God, or must be directly given along with it.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1 John 2:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, “the love of God,” is ambiguous like <span class="greekheb">אַהֲבַת יְהֹוָה</span>, <span class="ital">amor Dei, l’ amore di Dio, l’amour de Dieu, die Liebe Gottes</span>. It might be objective genitive, “love for God,” “die Liebe zu Gott” (Rothe). But the believer’s love for God is never perfected in this life. The genitive is subjective (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm" title="In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.">1 John 4:9</a>), <span class="ital">amor Dei erga honunem, per Christum nobis reconciliatus</span> (Bengel), and the idea is that the redeeming love of God has attained its end in the man who observes His Word. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm" title="He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.">Isaiah 53:11</a>. St. Augustine understands “the love of God” as His love for sinners, a forgiving love like that of Jesus when He prayed on the Cross “Father, forgive them”. “What is the perfection of love? It is both to love one’s enemies and to love them in order that they may be brethren.” By cultivating a love like this we get to know that we know Him. <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span> (<span class="ital">b</span>) points forward to <span class="greekheb">ὁ λέγων</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., introducing a second assurance. It is not enough to know Him; we must be sure of continuing in fellowship with Him, of “abiding in Him” to the end. This assurance comes by “walking even as He walked”; <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the conformation of our lives to His is an evidence of our abiding interest in Him, our vital union with Him. We get like Him by imitating Him, and our likeness to Him is an irrefragable evidence to ourselves and the the world that we are His, as a son’s likeness to his father proves their relationship. <span class="greekheb">ὀφείλει</span>, “is bound,” “ist schuldig” (Rothe), of <span class="ital">moral obligation</span>. The claim (<span class="greekheb">λέγων</span>) must be honourably attested. <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς</span> in this section refers grammatically to Jesus Christ <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

Here it stands first for emphasis; <span class="ital">verily in him:</span> comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm" title="Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;">John 8:31</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is the love of God perfected</span>] Or, <span class="ital">the love of God hath been perfected</span>. We need both renderings in order to bring out the full force of the Greek, which means ‘has been made perfect and remains so’. Obedience, not feeling, is the test of perfect love. This declaration shews that it is quite wrong to make ‘we know Him’ in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1 John 2:3</a></span> and ‘I know Him’ in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1 John 2:4</a></span> a Hebraism for ‘love Him’. Even if ‘know’ is ever used in the sense of ‘<span class="ital">love</span>’, which may be doubted, S. John would hardly in the same sentence use ‘know’ in two totally different senses (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1 John 2:3</a></span>). S. John’s mention of love here shews that when he means ‘love’ he writes ‘love’ and not ‘know’. He declares that true knowledge involves love, but they are not identical, any more than convex and concave. ‘The love of God’ here means ‘the love of man to God’: this is the common usage in this Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-15.htm" title="Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.">1 John 2:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1 John 3:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.">1 John 4:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-3.htm" title="For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.">1 John 5:3</a>). Only once is the genitive subjective and means ‘the love of God for man’; and there the context makes this quite clear (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm" title="In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.">1 John 4:9</a>). ‘Love,’ both verb and substantive, is one of S. John’s favourite words. His Gospel is the Gospel of Love and his Epistle the Epistle of Love. ‘To perfect’ is also much more common in his writings than elsewhere in N. T., excepting the Epistle to the Hebrews, especially in the passive voice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.">1 John 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world....">1 John 4:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-23.htm" title="I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.">John 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-28.htm" title="After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.">John 19:28</a>). S. John is here speaking, as often in this Epistle, of an <span class="ital">ideal</span> state of things. No Christian’s love to God is perfect: but the more perfect his knowledge, the more perfect his obedience and his love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hereby we know</span>] Or, <span class="ital">Herein we come to know:</span> it is the same phrase as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1 John 2:3</a></span>, and should probably, as there, be taken with what follows, rather than with what precedes.

In St. John <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> is no mere expletive; it expresses reality, and reality that is <span class="accented">known.</span> From verse 4 we might have expected "of a truth <span class="accented">he knoweth God</span>;" but the apostle goes beyond this, and shows that really knowing God involves loving him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-11.htm">1 John 4:11</a>). The context shows that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is objective - his love of God rather than God's love of him. The insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> here, and the drift of the Epistle thus far, are in favour of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in verses 3-5 meaning God rather than Christ, although <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in verse 2 tells the other way. The last clause sums up and reaffirms, but as usual with a new turn of thought, the whole section (verses 3-5), which begins and ends with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Knowing God implies keeping his Word; and keeping his Word involves loving him; and all this implies being in him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, having that fellowship with him and his Son in which the Christian's life (which is eternal life) consists, and to promote which St. John publishes his Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3, 4</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Keepeth His word (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Note the changed phrase: word for commandments. The word is the revelation regarded as a whole, which includes all the separate commandments or injunctions. See the use of &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; word, and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; precept, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm">John 14:21-24</a>.<p>Is the love of God perfected (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., rendering the perfect tense more closely, hath the love of God been perfected. The change in the form of this antithetic clause is striking. He who claims to know God, yet lives in disobedience, is a liar. We should expect as an offset to this: He that keepeth His commandments is of the truth; or, the truth is in him. Instead we have, "In him has the love of God been perfected." In other words, the obedient child of God is characterized, not by any representative trait or quality of his own personality, but merely as the subject of the work of divine love: as the sphere in which that love accomplishes its perfect work.<p>The phrase &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; the love of God, may mean either the love which God shows, or the love of which God is the object, or the love which is characteristic of God whether manifested by Himself or by His obedient child through His Spirit. John's usage is not decisive like Paul's, according to which the love of God habitually means the love which proceeds from and is manifested by God. The exact phrase, the love of God or the love of the Father, is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9</a>, in the undoubted sense of the love of God to men. The same sense is intended in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>, though differently expressed. The sense is doubtful in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-5.htm">1 John 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12</a>. Men's love to God is clearly meant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-3.htm">1 John 5:3</a>. The phrase occurs only twice in the Gospels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-42.htm">Luke 6:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-42.htm">John 5:42</a>), and in both cases the sense is doubtful. Some, as Ebrard, combine the two, and explain the love of God as the mutual relation of love between God and men.<p>It is not possible to settle the point decisively, but I incline to the view that the fundamental idea of the love of God as expounded by John is the love which God has made known and which answers to His nature. In favor of this is the general usage of &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; love, in the New Testament, with the subjective genitive. The object is more commonly expressed by &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; towards, or to. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a>. Still stronger is John's treatment of the subject in ch. 4. Here we have, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9</a>, the manifestation of the love of God in us (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;) By our life in Christ and our love to God we are a manifestation of God's love. Directly following this is a definition of the essential nature of love. "In this is love; i.e., herein consists love: not that we have loved God, but that He loved us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>). Our mutual love is a proof that God dwells in us. God dwelling in us, His love is perfected in us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12</a>). The latter clause, it would seem, must be explained according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>. Then (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-16.htm">1 John 4:16</a>), "We have known and believed the love that God hath in us" (see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-22.htm">John 16:22</a>, on the phrase have love). "God is love;" that is His nature, and He imparts this nature to be the sphere in which His children dwell. "He that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God." Finally, our love is engendered by His love to us. "We love Him because He first loved us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-19.htm">1 John 4:19</a>).<p>In harmony with this is <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-9.htm">John 15:9</a>. "As the Father loved me, I also loved you. Continue ye in my love." My love must be explained by I loved you. This is the same idea of divine love as the sphere or element of renewed being; and this idea is placed, as in the passage we are considering, in direct connection with the keeping of the divine commandments. "If ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love."<p>This interpretation does not exclude man's love to God. On the contrary, it includes it. The love which God has, is revealed as the love of God in the love of His children towards Him, no less than in His manifestations of love to them. The idea of divine love is thus complex. Love, in its very essence, is reciprocal. Its perfect ideal requires two parties. It is not enough to tell us, as a bare, abstract truth, that God is love. The truth must be rounded and filled out for us by the appreciable exertion of divine love upon an object, and by the response of the object. The love of God is perfected or completed by the perfect establishment of the relation of love between God and man. When man loves perfectly, his love is the love of God shed abroad in his heart. His love owes both its origin and its nature to the love of God.<p>The word verily (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;) is never used by John as a mere formula of affirmation, but has the meaning of a qualitative adverb, expressing not merely the actual existence of a thing, but its existence in a manner most absolutely corresponding to &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; truth. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>. Hath been perfected. John is presenting the ideal of life in God. "This is the love of God that we keep His commandments." Therefore whosoever keepeth God's word, His message in its entirety, realizes the perfect relation of love.<p>We are in Him<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>.
