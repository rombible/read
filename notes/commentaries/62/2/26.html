What value should we put upon gospel truth! Thereby the promise of eternal life is made sure. The promise God makes, is suitable to his own greatness, power, and goodness; it is eternal life. The Spirit of truth will not lie; and he teaches all things in the present dispensation, all things necessary to our knowledge of God in Christ, and their glory in the gospel. The apostle repeats the kind words, little children; which denotes his affection. He would persuade by love. Gospel privileges oblige to gospel duties; and those anointed by the Lord Jesus abide with him. The new spiritual nature is from the Lord Christ. He that is constant to the practice of religion in trying times, shows that he is born from above, from the Lord Christ. Then, let us beware of holding the truth in unrighteousness, remembering that those only are born of God, who bear his holy image, and walk in his most righteous ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you - Respecting their character, and in order to guard you against their arts.

But it is more appropriate (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-21.htm" title="I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.">1 John 2:21</a>) to refer the apostle’s word to a teaching proceeding from himself or other apostolic teachers; so Hornejus, de Wette-Brückner, Lücke, Düsterdieck, Braune, etc.—only we must not restrict the generally expressed thought merely to instruction about the false teachers, even though it is intended with special reference to that.[180] Believers need no human teacher in order that the divine truth may be made known to them. They have received, with the word which was declared unto them (<span class="greekheb">ὃ ἤκουσαν</span>), the <span class="greekheb">χρῖσμα</span>, which leads them <span class="greekheb">εἰς πᾶσαν τὴν ἀλήθειαν</span>; therefore the apostle frequently in this Epistle emphasizes the fact that he does not want to <span class="ital">instruct</span> them, but is writing to them what they already know (<span class="greekheb">οἴδατε πάντα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1 John 2:20</a>). John thereby assumes <span class="ital">believing</span> readers, in whose hearts that which they have heard from the beginning is preserved true and uncorrupted. Nothing <span class="ital">new</span> therefore can be proclaimed to <span class="ital">the believers</span>, but only that which they already possess in faith may be brought to a clearer consciousness.[181]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛʼ Ὡς ΤῸ ΑὐΤῸ ΧΡῖΣΜΑ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>] In this second part of the verse the first question is about the construction. Lücke, Ewald, de Wette, Neander, Düsterdieck, Braune (and previously Oecumenius and Theophylact) think that the whole to the end of the verse forms <span class="ital">one</span> period, in which the premise <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὡς</span> … <span class="greekheb">διδάσκει</span> is resumed by the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΚΑΘῺς ἘΔΊΔΑΞΕΝ ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span>, and has its conclusion in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΝΕῖΤΕ</span></span></span> (or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΕΤΕ</span></span></span>) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span>, and in which the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἈΛΗΘῈς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΨΕῦΔΟς</span></span></span> contain a parenthetical adjunct. The difficulty that in the resumed premise <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> is put instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛΆ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΘΏς</span></span></span> instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς</span></span></span>, and the aorist <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΔΊΔΑΞΕΝ</span></span></span> instead of the present <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΔΆΣΚΕΙ</span></span></span>, can certainly be easily got over by the fact that the apostle wanted not simply to repeat the thought, but at the same time to bring out a new phase of the subject; but the additional <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡῚ ΠΆΝΤΩΝ</span></span></span>, which does not stand in any relationship whatever to the conclusion <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΝΕῖΤΕ</span></span></span> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΕΤΕ</span></span></span>), is decidedly opposed to this construction; to this is added that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛΆ</span></span></span> indicates that the apostle wants to express a <span class="ital">contrast</span> to the <span class="greekheb">οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., that is, a clause in which the teaching of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡῖΣΜΑ</span></span></span> is described as such as removes the need of any other (human) teacher; finally, that the subordinate clause <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΟὐΚ ἜΣΤΙ ΨΕῦΔΟς</span></span></span> conjoined with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΗΘΈς ἘΣΤΙ</span></span></span> raises this thought above the level of a mere parenthetical adjunct, and stamps it as a leading thought. For these reasons it is preferable, with Luther, Calvin, Baumgarten-Crusius, Sander, Brückner, Besser, and in general most of the commentators, to divide the whole into two parts, and to regard <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἈΛΗΘ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἘΣΤΙ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΨΕῦΔΟς</span></span></span> as the conclusion of the first part; Luther: “but as the anointing teaches you all things, it is true, and is no lie; and,” etc.[182]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> refers not so much to the form and fashion, as to the substance of the teaching.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΑὐΤῸ ΧΡῖΣΜΑ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ΤῸ ΑὐΤΌ</span></span></span> is not <span class="ital">idem</span> semper, non aliud atque aliud, sed sibi constans et idem apud sanctos omnes (Bengel; so also Erdmann), but: <span class="ital">just the same</span> <span class="greekheb">χρῖσμα</span>, namely <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ἘΛΆΒΕΤΕ</span></span></span>. Still the reading <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span> might be preferable, for it seems unnecessary to emphasize the fact that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡῖΣΜΑ</span></span></span> is the same that they have received, and no other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡῚ ΠΆΝΤΩΝ</span></span></span> is used in the same sense as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΝΤΑ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1 John 2:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ἈΛΗΘΈς ἘΣΤΙ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.] <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> before the conclusion, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm" title="Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning.

Because this is true, and is no <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΨΕῦΔΟς</span></span></span>, therefore believers do not need any teacher besides, but they may rely entirely upon the teaching of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡῖΣΜΑ</span></span></span>. To this thought the apostle further adds a new one, in which he goes back to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm" title="Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.">1 John 2:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΚΑΘΏς</span>] <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΘΏς</span></span></span>, as distinct from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὡς</span></span></span>, means: “<span class="ital">in proportion as.</span>”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐδίδαξεν ὑμᾶς</span>] namely, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠʼ ἈΡΧῆς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΜΈΝΕΤΕ</span> (<span class="greekheb">ΜΕΝΕῖΤΕ</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span>] The <span class="ital">Recepta</span> <span class="greekheb">μενεῖτε</span> is taken by Socinus, a Lapide, Lorinus, Semler, and others, in the sense of the imperative; others retain the future meaning, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm" title="Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning. If that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, you also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.">1 John 2:24</a>; thus Beza says: mihi videtur omnino servanda Futuri propria significatio ut est optime sperantis; as the apostle thereby expresses his good confidence, the future accordingly has the vim consolandi (Bengel). The correct reading, however, is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΕΤΕ</span></span></span>, which, corresponding to the preceding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΈΝΕΙ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΧΕΤΕ</span></span></span>, is not imperative (Ewald, Braune), but indicative (Brückner), and as such it expresses the firm conviction of the apostle that they, according to the constant instruction of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡῖΣΜΑ</span></span></span>, abide <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> in <span class="ital">Christ</span> (Erasmus erroneously: = <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ χρίσματι</span>, and Baumgarten-Crusius: “in the teaching which the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡῖΣΜΑ</span></span></span> communicates to them”). In favour of this view is also the exhortation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm" title="And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.">1 John 2:28</a> herewith connected.[183]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[179] At the most it may be said that <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> is used with the verb <span class="greekheb">χρείαν ἔχειν</span>, because that of which one is in need may be regarded as the object of his need; on the other hand, it is unsuitable when Braune says: “the teaching is here regarded as the object and purpose for the sake of the position of him who is to be taught.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[180] Lücke paraphrases the passage: “The reason why I do not write any more about the false teachers, is that I assume that that holy unction of the Spirit remains in you; and if that is so, you do not need that any one shall instruct you further on the subject.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[181] Several commentators rightly remark here, that in the statement of the apostle there is no foundation for the error of the “enthusiasts,” inasmuch as John does not separate the teaching of the <span class="greekheb">χρῖσμα</span> and the apostolic word from one another, but places them in the closest connection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[182] Ebrard makes <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> dependent upon <span class="greekheb">ἔγραψα</span>, ver. 26; it is true he himself admits that this gives a “<span class="ital">laxe</span> and <span class="ital">legere</span> form of speech,” but he thinks that there is “nothing strange” in this, because the apostle is speaking to <span class="ital">children</span> in quite <span class="ital">childlike</span> language. But what child’s understanding would be capable of supplying with the words: “but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things,” the thought: “<span class="ital">sc.</span> I have said to you”?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[183] Myrberg on ver. 28: Sperantis verba illa sunt, quae paullo ante leguntur; haec adhortantis, quod novum quoddam initium dicendi indicat.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-26.htm" title="These things have I written to you concerning them that seduce you....">1 John 2:26-27</a>.
