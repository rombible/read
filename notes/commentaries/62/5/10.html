He knows by experience, that Jesus is the Son of God in such a sense as to be an all- sufficient Saviour, and that he came by cleansing water, and by atoning blood, having received justification through the latter, and sanctification through the former. Or, which is to the same purpose, he hath received the testimony mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-11.htm" title="And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.">1 John 5:11</a>.

Add to the above, that eternal life is begun in him, and that God will, in due time, bestow on him the full enjoyment of it, he hath the testimony of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; the Father having lifted up the light of his countenance upon him, and thereby put joy and gladness into his heart, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/4-6.htm" title="There be many that say, Who will show us any good?

The real Christian has seen his guilt and misery, and his need of such a Saviour. He has seen the suitableness of such a Saviour to all his spiritual wants and circumstances. He has found and felt the power of the word and doctrine of Christ, humbling, healing, quickening, and comforting his soul. He has a new disposition, and new delights, and is not the man that he formerly was. Yet he finds still a conflict with himself, with sin, with the flesh, the world, and wicked powers. But he finds such strength from faith in Christ, that he can overcome the world, and travel on towards a better. Such assurance has the gospel believer: he has a witness in himself, which puts the matter out of doubt with him, except in hours of darkness or conflict; but he cannot be argued out of his belief in the leading truths of the gospel. Here is what makes the unbeliever's sin so awful; the sin of unbelief. He gives God the lie; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son. It is in vain for a man to plead that he believes the testimony of God in other things, while he rejects it in this. He that refuses to trust and honour Christ as the Son of God, who disdains to submit to his teaching as Prophet, to rely on his atonement and intercession as High Priest, or to obey him as King, is dead in sin, under condemnation; nor will any outward morality, learning, forms, notions, or confidences avail him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself - The evidence that Jesus is the Son of God. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>. This cannot refer to any distinct and immediate "revelation" of that fact, that Jesus is the Christ, to the soul of the individual, and is not to be understood as independent of the external evidence of that truth, or as superseding the necessity of that evidence; but the "witness" here referred to is the fruit of all the evidence, external and internal, on the heart, producing this result; that is, there is the deepest conviction of the truth that Jesus is the Son of God. There is the evidence derived from the fact that the soul has found peace by believing on him; from the fact that the troubles and anxieties of the mind on account of sin have been removed by faith in Christ; from the new views of God and heaven which have resulted from faith in the Lord Jesus; from the effect of this in disarming death of its terrors; and from the whole influence of the gospel on the intellect and the affections - on the heart and the life. These things constitute a mass of evidence for the truth of the Christian religion, whose force the believer cannot resist, and make the sincere Christian ready to sacrifice anything rather than his religion; ready to go to the stake rather than to renounce his Saviour.

Refusal to credit God's testimony ("believeth not God") is involved in refusal to believe IN (to rest one's trust in) Jesus Christ, the object of God's record or testimony.

As a divine person who came in the flesh, and obeyed the law, and brought in everlasting righteousness, and obtained life and salvation for men: he that with the heart believes in him for righteousness, and eternal life, he being the Son of God, truly and properly God, and so able to save all that believe in him, <p>hath the witness in himself; of the need he stands in of Christ, and of the suitableness, fulness, and excellency of him; the Spirit of God enlightening him into the impurity of his nature, his impotence to do anything spiritually good, his incapacity to atone for sin, and the insufficiency of his righteousness to justify him before God; and convincing him that nothing but the blood of the Son of God can cleanse him from sin, and only his sacrifice can expiate it, and his righteousness justify him from it, and that without him he can do nothing; testifying also to the efficacy of his blood, the completeness of his sacrifice and satisfaction, the excellency of his righteousness, and the energy of his grace and strength: so he comes to have such a witness in himself, that if ten thousand arguments were ever so artfully formed, in favour of the purity of human nature, the power of man's free will, and the sufficiency of his righteousness, and against the sacrifice and righteousness of Christ, the dignity of his person, as the Son of God, which gives virtue to his blood, sacrifice, and righteousness, they would all signify nothing to him, he would be proof against them. And such an one very readily receives into him the testimony God gives of his Son, of the glory and excellency of his person, and retains it in him. The Alexandrian copy and the Vulgate Latin version read, "hath the witness of God in him"; to which the Ethiopic, version agrees, and confirm the last observation: <p>he that believeth not God; does not receive his testimony concerning his Son: the Alexandrian copy, and two of Stephens's, and the Vulgate Latin version read, "he that believeth not the Son"; and the Ethiopic version, his Son; and the Arabic version, "the Son of God"; and so is a direct antithesis to the phrase in the former clause of the verse: <p>hath made him a liar; not the Son, but God, as the Arabic version renders it, "hath made God himself a liar"; who is the God, of truth, and cannot lie; it is impossible he should; and as nothing can be, more contumelious and reproachful to the being and nature of God, so nothing can more fully expose and aggravate the sin of unbelief, with respect to Christ, as the Son of God: <p>because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son; at the times and places before observed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.</span><p>(11) He proves the sureness of the earthly witness by every man's conscience having that testimony in itself, whose conscience he says cannot be deceived because it agrees with the heavenly testimony which the Father gives of the Son: for otherwise the Father must be a liar, if the conscience which agrees and assents to the Father, should lie.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_john/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-10.htm" title="He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son.">1 John 5:10</a>.

A subtle and profound analysis of the exercise of soul which issues in assured faith. Three stages: (1) “Believe God” (<span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν τῷ Θεῷ</span>, <span class="ital">credere Deo</span>), accept His testimony concerning His Son, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, not simply His testimony at the Baptism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>) but the historic manifestation of God in Christ, the Incarnation. God speaks not by words but by acts, and to set aside His supreme act, and all the forces which it has set in operation is to “make Him a liar” by treating His historic testimony as unworthy of credit. (2) “Believe in the Son of God” (<span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν εἰς τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">credere in Filium Dei</span>), make the believing sell-surrender which is the reasonable and inevitable consequence of contemplating the Incarnation and recognising the wonder of it. (3) The Inward Testimony (<span class="greekheb">τὴν μαρτυρίαν ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, <span class="ital">testimonium in seipso</span>). “Fecisti nos ad te, et inquietum est cor nostrum donec requiescat in te” (Aug.). The love of Jesus satisfies the deepest need of our nature. When He is welcomed, the soul rises up and greets Him as “all its salvation and all its desire,” and the testimony is no longer external in history but an inward experience (<span class="ital">cf.</span> note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm" title="In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.">1 John 4:9</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἡμῖν</span>), and therefore indubitable. These three stages are, according to the metaphor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>, (1) hearing the Saviour’s voice, (2) opening the door, (3) communion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">He that believeth on the Son of God</span>] For the first time in this Epistle we have the full phrase ‘to believe <span class="ital">on</span>’, of which S. John is so fond in his Gospel, where it occurs nearly 40 times. Elsewhere in N.T. it occurs only about 10 times. It expresses the strongest confidence and trust; faith moves towards and reposes on its object. Whereas ‘to believe a person’ (<span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν τινί</span>) need mean no more than to believe what he says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm" title="Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.">1 John 4:1</a>), ‘to believe <span class="ital">on</span> or <span class="ital">in</span> a person’ (<span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν εἴς τινα</span>) means to have full trust in his character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath the witness</span>] Some authorities add ‘of God,’ which is right as an interpretation, though not as part of the text. He has it as an abiding possession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-38.htm" title="And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.">John 5:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-34.htm" title="For you had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.">Hebrews 10:34</a>): ‘hath’ does not mean merely ‘he accepts it’. Comp. ‘The Spirit Himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of God’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-16.htm" title="The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:">Romans 8:16</a>); ‘God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in himself</span>] According to the revised reading, <span class="bld"><span class="ital">in</span> him</span>. Wiclif has ‘in him’, Luther, <span class="ital">bei ihm</span>: Tyndale added the ‘self’, and most English Versions have followed him. But ‘in him’ in this context cannot mean anything but ‘in himself’. The external witness faithfully accepted becomes internal certitude. Our faith in the Divinity of Christ attests its own Divine origin, for we could not have obtained it otherwise than from God. “The human mind is made for truth, and so rests in truth, as it cannot rest in falsehood. When then it once becomes possessed of a truth, what is to dispossess it? but this is to be certain; therefore once certitude, always certitude. If certitude in any matter be the termination of all doubt or fear about its truth, and an unconditional conscious adherence to it, it carries with it an inward assurance, strong though implicit, that it shall never fail” (J. H. Newman).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he that believeth not God</span>] He that has not even enough faith to induce him to believe what God says (see first note on this verse). There are great diversities of reading here; ‘God’, ‘the Son’, ‘the Son of God’, ‘His Son’, ‘Jesus Christ’: of these ‘God’ (<span class="greekheb">א</span>BKLP) is certainly to be preferred. The others have arisen from a wish to make ‘he that believeth not’ more exactly balance ‘he that believeth’. But, as we have repeatedly seen, S. John’s antitheses seldom balance exactly. Yet it is by no means impossible that all five are wrong, and that we ought simply to read ‘<span class="ital">He that believeth not</span> hath made Him a liar’: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-18.htm" title="He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.">John 3:18</a>, of which this verse seems to be an echo. In ‘he that believeth not’, the case is stated quite generally and indefinitely (<span class="greekheb">ὁ μὴ πιστεύων</span>): the Apostle is not pointing at some one person who was known as not believing (<span class="greekheb">ὁ οὐ πιστεύων</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-14.htm" title="We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers.

The former is obscure in meaning; the latter, though probably correct as an interpretation, is inaccurate as a translation, for the better  reading is <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>.

The believer in the Incarnation has the Divine testimony in his heart, and it abides with him as an additional source of evidence, supplementing and confirming the external evidence. In its daily experience, the soul finds ever fresh proof that the declaration, "This is my beloved Son," is true. But even without this internal corroboration, the external evidence suffices, and he who rejects it makes God a liar; for it is God who presents the evidence, and presents it as sufficient and true. The second half of the verse is <span class="accented">parenthetical, to</span> show that the unbeliever, though be has no witness in himself, is not therefore excused.
