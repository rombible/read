It is wanting likewise in the first Syriac, and other ancient versions, particularly the Coptic, Arabic, and Ethiopic, and in many of the present Latin MSS. With respect to quotations from the fathers, Mill acknowledges that few of the Greek writers, who lived before the council of Nice, have cited this verse. The same he observes concerning those who, after that council, wrote in defence of the Trinity against the Arians, and other heretics; which, he thinks, shows that this verse was not in their copies.” But, on the other hand, the proofs of the authenticity of this verse are,” 1st, Some of the most ancient and most correct <span class="ital">Vatican </span>Greek copies, from which the Spanish divines formed the Complutensian edition of the Greek Testament, and with which they were furnished by Pope Leo X.,” one of which Mill speaks of as peculiarly eminent, of great antiquity, and approved fidelity. “2d, A Greek copy, called by Erasmus, <span class="ital">Codex Britannicus, </span>on the authority of which he inserted this verse in his edition anno, 1522, but which he had omitted in his two former editions. This is supposed to be a MS. at present in the Trinity College library, Dublin, in which this, verse is found with the omission of the word <span class="greekheb">αγισν</span>, <span class="ital">holy, </span>before <span class="greekheb">πνευμα</span>, <span class="ital">Spirit. </span>It likewise wants the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-8.htm" title="And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.">1 John 5:8</a>, namely, <span class="ital">and these three are one. </span>All Stephens’s MSS., being seven in number, which contain the catholic epistles, have this verse: only they want the words <span class="greekheb">εν ουρανω</span>, <span class="ital">in heaven. </span>4th, The Vulgate version, in most of the MS. copies and printed editions of which it is found, with some variations. 5th, The testimony of Tertullian, who alludes to this verse, <span class="ital">Praxeam, </span>c. 25, and who lived in an age in which he saith, <span class="ital">Præscript, </span>c. 30, the <span class="ital">authenticæ literæ </span>(the authentic writings) of the apostles were read in the churches. By <span class="ital">authenticæ literæ </span>Mill understands, either the autographs of the apostles, which the churches, to whom they were written, had carefully preserved, or correct transcripts taken from these autographs. Also the testimony of Cyprian, who flourished about the middle of the third century, and who, in his epistle to Jubajanus, expressly cites the latter clause of this verse. The objections which have been raised against the testimonies of Tertullian and Cyprian, Mill hath mentioned and answered in his long note at the end of 1 John 5., which see in page 582 of Kuster’s edition. 6th, The testimony of many Greek and Latin fathers in subsequent ages, who have cited the last clause of this verse; and some who have appealed to the Arians themselves as acknowledging its authenticity. Lastly, the Complutensian edition, anno 1515, had this seventh verse exactly as it is in the present printed copies, with this difference only, that instead of <span class="ital">these three are one, </span>it hath substituted the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-8.htm" title="And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.">1 John 5:8</a>, <span class="ital">And these three agree in one, </span>and hath omitted it in that verse. These arguments appear to Mill of such weight, that, after balancing them against the opposite arguments, he gave it as his decided opinion that, in whatever manner this verse disappeared, it was undoubtedly in St. John’s autograph, and in some of the copies which were transcribed from it.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Instead of passing any judgment in a matter so much contested,” says Macknight, “I shall only observe, 1st, That this verse, instead of disturbing the sense of the verses with which it is joined, rather renders it more connected and complete. 2d, That in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-9.htm" title="If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.">1 John 5:9</a>, <span class="ital">the witness of God </span>is supposed to have been before appealed to: <span class="ital">If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. </span>And yet, if <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm" title="For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.">1 John 5:7</a> is excluded, the witness of God is nowhere mentioned by the apostle. 3d, That in the opinion of Beza, Calvin, and other orthodox commentators, the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm" title="For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.">1 John 5:7</a> hath no relation to the unity of the divine essence. If so, the Trinitarians, on the one hand, need not contend for the authenticity of this verse, in the view of supporting their doctrine, nor the Arians, on the other, strive to have it excluded from the text as opposing their tenets. 4th, That the doctrine which the Trinitarians affirm to be asserted in this verse is contained in other places of Scripture. So Wall saith. Dr. Benson likewise, in his Dissertation, written to prove this verse not genuine, saith, ‘If it were genuine, there could nothing be proved thereby but what may be proved from other texts of Scripture.’” The reader who wishes for more satisfactory information respecting the authenticity of the text, may find it in Dr. Calamy’s Vindication of it, annexed to his Sermons on the Trinity, preached at the lecture at Salter’s Hall, and published in 1722.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">There are three that bear witness, </span>&c. — When there is a cause depending in any court, and proof is to be given in order to the decision of it, witnesses are produced, and if they are credible, and liable to no just objection, the cause is determined according to the evidence they give, unless they, to whom it belongs to determine the matter, are partial or biased. Now St. John, aiming at the establishment of those in the truth to whom he wrote this his first epistle, represents the cause depending before them as very weighty; a cause of such consequence, that it highly concerned them to weigh all matters well before they came to a determination. It was really no less a matter than whether Christianity was true or a forgery: and he intimates to them that they had very good evidence to assist them in determining. There were two sets of witnesses, the one above, the other below; and both of them unexceptionable. The one was of <span class="ital">persons, </span>and the other of <span class="ital">things, </span>which, by a figure, are represented as witnesses. The persons witnessing were, of all others in the universe, the most worthy of credit and regard, being all truly and properly divine persons, even <span class="ital">the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost — </span>Persons with whom none that had the least knowledge of Christianity could be unacquainted. For these are the very persons in whose name they had been baptized, and to whom they had been most solemnly dedicated. There is only this difference to be observed, that the second witness mentioned has another name given him. In the form of baptism he is called the <span class="ital">Son, </span>but here the <span class="ital">Word; </span>a name or title which St. John seems to have taken a peculiar pleasure in giving to the Lord Jesus, for he begins his gospel with it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>, repeats it again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-14.htm" title="And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:">1 John 5:14</a> of the same chapter, and in entering upon this epistle, represents it as the great subject about which he was going to write; and mentions it again in the Apocalypse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-13.htm" title="And he was clothed with a clothing dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.">Revelation 19:13</a>. And as for the third witness, the Holy Ghost, he would not have been mentioned separate from the other two if he were not distinct from both. For the apostle does not speak of three <span class="ital">names </span>as bearing record, but three distinct <span class="ital">persons, </span>acting different ways and in different capacities. It is also hereby intimated that the evidence given is very full and convincing, no one of the witnesses being liable to any just objection: so that Christianity, the truth of which is so well attested, must necessarily have a firm foundation. Observe, reader, the witnesses brought forth and appealed to on this occasion, are the same that our Lord himself had mentioned as attesting his divine mission and Messiahship in the days of his flesh, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>, where he speaks of the Father <span class="ital">that sent him as bearing witness of him; </span>and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-18.htm" title="I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me bears witness of me.">John 8:18</a>, where he says that he bore witness of himself; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>, where he mentions the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, as testifying of him. Accordingly we learn from the gospel history, 1st, That the Father bore witness to Jesus with an audible voice three sundry times; first, when he was baptized, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:...">Matthew 3:16-17</a>; a second time when he was transfigured, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-5.htm" title="While he yet spoke, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear you him.">Matthew 17:5</a>; and a third time after he had raised Lazarus from the dead, when many flocked out of Jerusalem to meet and applaud him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-28.htm" title="Father, glorify your name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.">John 12:28</a>; and the two former of those times, the testimony borne is the same with that here mentioned by St. John, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm" title="Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him.">1 John 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-5.htm" title="Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?">1 John 5:5</a>, namely, that Jesus is God’s beloved Son, and therefore the true Messiah and Saviour of the world. 2d, The Word made flesh, the Lord Jesus himself, several times bore the same testimony; as, for instance, to the woman of Samaria, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-26.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I that speak to you am he.">John 4:26</a>; to the Jews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-24.htm" title="I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.">John 8:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm" title="I and my Father are one.">John 10:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm" title="Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?">John 10:36</a>; and especially when adjured by the high-priest, in the name of the living God, to tell them whether he was <span class="ital">the Christ, the Son of God, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-61.htm" title="But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?">Mark 14:61</a>. And he, in effect, bore the same testimony when he showed himself to dying Stephen, as standing at the right hand of God in all the splendour of the divine glory, — when he appeared to Paul on his way to Damascus, surrounded with a light above the brightness of the sun, — and when he manifested himself to John in the isle of Patmos, to give him the wonderful visions contained in the Apocalypse. And, 3d, The Holy Ghost in many ways bore the same testimony, as by his descending on Jesus immediately after his baptism, and in a glorious manner remaining on him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-32.htm" title="And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him....">John 1:32-33</a>, and working miracles by the disciples sent out during his life: by coming down on the apostles in fiery tongues ten days after our Lord’s ascension, thereby publicly declaring to all present, and to all to whom a well-attested account of that fact should come, that he really was the Son of God, exalted to the right hand of the Majesty on high; a truth which these same apostles boldly testified from that day forward in Judea, and all the world over. Thus we see what the apostle means when he says, <span class="ital">the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost witnessed in heaven. </span>Or, as the words may be rendered, <span class="ital">there are three in heaven that bear, </span>or <span class="ital">that bore witness, </span>(for <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρουντες </span>is a participle of the imperfect as well as of the present tense,) distinguished from the other three witnesses mentioned in the next verse, that are on earth. The meaning is, not that they bear, or bore, witness to the angels and blessed spirits that are in heaven, but only that they speak from heaven, while the others speak on earth. They witness while they are in heaven, notwithstanding that they are so much above us, and so far distant from us: and therefore the testimony they bear is to be the more regarded, and we shall be the more inexcusable if we do not acquiesce in it, and improve by it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And these three are one </span>— The word is not <span class="greekheb">εις</span>, <span class="ital">one person, </span>but <span class="greekheb">εν</span>, <span class="ital">one thing, </span>expressing evidently the unity of the three, and that not only as to their testimony, but also and especially with respect to their nature; it being evident, from a variety of other texts, that each of the three is truly and properly God, as has been abundantly proved in the course of these notes. If unity of testimony had only been intended, it is probable the expression would have been as in the close of the next verse, where the three witnesses on earth are spoken of, <span class="ital">these three </span><span class="greekheb">εις το εν εισιν</span>, <span class="ital">agree in one.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:6-8 We are inwardly and outwardly defiled; inwardly, by the power and pollution of sin in our nature. For our cleansing there is in and by Christ Jesus, the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghost. Some think that the two sacraments are here meant: baptism with water, as the outward sign of regeneration, and purifying from the pollution of sin by the Holy Spirit; and the Lord's supper, as the outward sign of the shedding Christ's blood, and the receiving him by faith for pardon and justification. Both these ways of cleansing were represented in the old ceremonial sacrifices and cleansings. This water and blood include all that is necessary to our salvation. By the water, our souls are washed and purified for heaven and the habitation of saints in light. By the blood, we are justified, reconciled, and presented righteous to God. By the blood, the curse of the law being satisfied, the purifying Spirit is obtained for the internal cleansing of our natures. The water, as well as the blood, came out of the side of the sacrificed Redeemer. He loved the church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word; that he might present it to himself a glorious church, Eph 5:25-27. This was done in and by the Spirit of God, according to the Saviour's declaration. He is the Spirit of God, and cannot lie. Three had borne witness to these doctrines concerning the person and the salvation of Christ. The Father, repeatedly, by a voice from heaven declared that Jesus was his beloved Son. The Word declared that He and the Father were One, and that whoever had seen him had seen the Father. And the Holy Ghost, who descended from heaven and rested on Christ at his baptism; who had borne witness to Him by all the prophets; and gave testimony to his resurrection and mediatorial office, by the gift of miraculous powers to the apostles. But whether this passage be cited or not, the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity stands equally firm and certain. To the doctrine taught by the apostles, respecting the person and salvation of Christ, there were three testimonies. 1. The Holy Spirit. We come into the world with a corrupt, carnal disposition, which is enmity to God. This being done away by the regeneration and new-creating of souls by the Holy Spirit, is a testimony to the Saviour. 2. The water: this sets forth the Saviour's purity and purifying power. The actual and active purity and holiness of his disciples are represented by baptism. 3. The blood which he shed: and this was our ransom, this testifies for Jesus Christ; it sealed up and finished the sacrifices of the Old Testament. The benefits procured by his blood, prove that he is the Saviour of the world. No wonder if he that rejects this evidence is judged a blasphemer of the Spirit of God. These three witnesses are for one and the same purpose; they agree in one and the same thing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For there are three that bear record in heaven ... - There are three that "witness," or that "bear witness" - the same Greek word which, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-8.htm">1 John 5:8</a>, is rendered "bear witness" - &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  marturountes. There is no passage of the New Testament which has given rise to so much discussion in regard to its genuineness as this. The supposed importance of the verse in its bearing on the doctrine of the Trinity has contributed to this, and has given to the discussion a degree of consequence which has pertained to the examination of the genuineness of no other passage of the New Testament. On the one hand, the clear testimony which it seems to bear to the doctrine of the Trinity, has made that portion of the Christian church which holds the doctrine reluctant in the highest degree to abandon it; and on the other hand, the same clearness of the testimony to that doctrine, has made those who deny it not less reluctant to admit the genuineness of the passage.<p>It is not consistent with the design of these notes to go into a full investigation of a question of this sort. And all that can be done is to state, in a brief way, the "results" which have been reached, in an examination of the question. Those who are disposed to pursue the investigation further, can find all that is to be said in the works referred to at the bottom of the page.  The portion of the passage, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm">1 John 5:7-8</a>, whose genuineness is disputed, is included in brackets in the following quotation, as it stands in the common editions of the New Testament: "For there are three that bear record (in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one. And there are three that bear witness on earth,) the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three agree in one." If the disputed passage, therefore, be omitted as spurious, the whole passage will read, "For there are three that bear record, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three agree in one." The reasons which seem to me to prove that the passage included in brackets is spurious, and should not be regarded as a part of the inspired writings, are briefly the following:<p>I. It is missing in all the earlier Greek manuscripts, for it is found in no Greek manuscript written before the 16th century. Indeed, it is found in only two Greek manuscripts of any age - one the Codex Montfortianus, or Britannicus, written in the beginning of the sixteenth century, and the other the Codex Ravianus, which is a mere transcript of the text, taken partly from the third edition of Stephen's New Testament, and partly from the Complutensian Polyglott. But it is incredible that a genuine passage of the New Testament should be missing in all the early Greek manuscripts.<p>II. It is missing in the earliest versions, and, indeed, in a large part of the versions of the New Testament which have been made in all former times. It is wanting in both the Syriac versions - one of which was made probably in the first century; in the Coptic, Armenian, Slavonic, Ethiopic, and Arabic.<p>III. It is never quoted by the Greek fathers in their controversies on the doctrine of the Trinity - a passage which would be so much in point, and which could not have failed to be quoted if it were genuine; and it is not referred to by the Latin fathers until the time of Vigilius, at the end of the 5th century. If the passage were believed to be genuine - nay, if it were known at all to be in existence, and to have any probability in its favor - it is incredible that in all the controversies which occurred in regard to the divine nature, and in all the efforts to define the doctrine of the Trinity, this passage should never have been referred to. But it never was; for it must be plain to anyone who examines the subject with an unbiassed mind, that the passages which are relied on to prove that it was quoted by Athanasius, Cyprian, Augustin, etc., (Wetstein, II., p. 725) are not taken from this place, and are not such as they would have made if they had been acquainted with this passage, and had designed to quote it. IV. The argument against the passage from the external proof is confirmed by internal evidence, which makes it morally certain that it cannot be genuine.<p>(a) The connection does not demand it. It does not contribute to advance what the apostle is saying, but breaks the thread of his argument entirely. He is speaking of certain things which bear "witness" to the fact that Jesus is the Messiah; certain things which were well known to those to whom he was writing - the Spirit, and the water, and the blood. How does it contribute to strengthen the force of this to say that in heaven there are "three that bear witness" - three not before referred to, and having no connection with the matter under consideration?<p>(b) The "language" is not such as John would use. He does, indeed, elsewhere use the term "Logos," or "Word" - &#x3bf;&#788; &#x39b;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  ho Logos, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm">1 John 1:1</a>, but it is never in this form, "The Father, and the Word;" that is, the terms "Father" and "Word" are never used by him, or by any of the other sacred writers, as correlative. The word "Son" - &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3a5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  ho Huios - is the term which is correlative to the "Father" in every other place as used by John, as well as by the other sacred writers. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-22.htm">1 John 2:22-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-14.htm">1 John 4:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_john/1-3.htm">2 John 1:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-9.htm">2 John 1:9</a>; and the Gospel of John, "passim." Besides, the correlative of the term "Logos," or "Word," with John, is not "Father," but "God." See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-13.htm">Revelation 19:13</a>.<p>(c) Without this passage, the sense of the argument is clear and appropriate. There are three, says John, which bear witness that Jesus is the Messiah. These are referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm">1 John 5:6</a>; and in immediate connection with this, in the argument, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-8.htm">1 John 5:8</a>, it is affirmed that their testimony goes to one point, and is harmonious. To say that there are other witnesses elsewhere, to say that they are one, contributes nothing to illustrate the nature of the testimony of these three - the water, and the blood, and the Spirit; and the internal sense of the passage, therefore, furnishes as little evidence of its genuineness as the external proof. V. It is easy to imagine how the passage found a place in the New Testament. It was at first written, perhaps, in the margin of some Latin manuscript, as expressing the belief of the writer of what was true in heaven, as well as on earth, and with no more intention to deceive than we have when we make a marginal note in a book. Some transcriber copied it into the body of the text, perhaps with a sincere belief that it was a genuine passage, omitted by accident; and then it became too important a passage in the argument for the Trinity, ever to be displaced but by the most clear critical evidence. It was rendered into Greek, and inserted in one Greek manuscript of the 16th century, while it was missing in all the earlier manuscripts.<p>VI. The passage is now omitted in the best editions of the Greek Testament, and regarded as spurious by the ablest critics. See Griesbach and Hahn. On the whole, therefore, the evidence seems to me to be clear that this passage is not a genuine portion of the inspired writings, and should not be appealed to in proof of the doctrine of the Trinity. One or two remarks may be made, in addition, in regard to its use.<p>(1) even on the supposition that it is genuine, as Bengel believed it was, and as he believed that some Greek manuscript would still be found which would contain it , yet it is not wise to adduce it as a proof-text. It would be much easier to prove the doctrine of the Trinity from other texts, than to demonstrate the genuineness of this.<p>(2) it is not necessary as a proof-text. The doctrine which it contains can be abundantly established from other parts of the New Testament, by passages about which there can be no doubt.<p>(3) the removal of this text does nothing to weaken the evidence for the doctrine of the Trinity, or to modify that doctrine. As it was never used to shape the early belief of the Christian world on the subject, so its rejection, and its removal from the New Testament, will do nothing to modify that doctrine. The doctrine was embraced, and held, and successfully defended without it, and it can and will be so still. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_john/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. three&#8212;Two or three witnesses were required by law to constitute adequate testimony. The only Greek manuscripts in any form which support the words, "in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one; and there are three that bear witness in earth," are the Montfortianus of Dublin, copied evidently from the modern Latin Vulgate; the Ravianus, copied from the Complutensian Polyglot; a manuscript at Naples, with the words added in the Margin by a recent hand; Ottobonianus, 298, of the fifteenth century, the Greek of which is a mere translation of the accompanying Latin. All the old versions omit the words. The oldest manuscripts of the Vulgate omit them: the earliest Vulgate manuscript which has them being Wizanburgensis, 99, of the eighth century. A scholium quoted in Matth&aelig;i, shows that the words did not arise from fraud; for in the words, in all Greek manuscripts "there are three that bear record," as the Scholiast notices, the word "three" is masculine, because the three things (the Spirit, the water, and the blood) are SYMBOLS OF THE Trinity. To this Cyprian, 196, also refers, "Of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, it is written, 'And these three are one' (a unity)." There must be some mystical truth implied in using "three" (Greek) in the masculine, though the antecedents, "Spirit, water, and blood," are neuter. That THE Trinity was the truth meant is a natural inference: the triad specified pointing to a still Higher Trinity; as is plain also from 1Jo 5:9, "the witness of God," referring to the Trinity alluded to in the Spirit, water, and blood. It was therefore first written as a marginal comment to complete the sense of the text, and then, as early at least as the eighth century, was introduced into the text of the Latin Vulgate. The testimony, however, could only be borne on earth to men, not in heaven. The marginal comment, therefore, that inserted "in heaven," was inappropriate. It is on earth that the context evidently requires the witness of the three, the Spirit, the water, and the blood, to be borne: mystically setting forth the divine triune witnesses, the Father, the Spirit, and the Son. Luecke notices as internal evidence against the words, John never uses "the Father" and "the Word" as correlates, but, like other New Testament writers, associates "the Son" with "the Father," and always refers "the Word" to "God" as its correlate, not "the Father." Vigilius, at the end of the fifth century, is the first who quotes the disputed words as in the text; but no Greek manuscript earlier than the fifteenth is extant with them. The term "Trinity" occurs first in the third century in Tertullian [Against Praxeas, 3].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_john/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having mentioned the Spirit’s testifying in the close of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm" title="This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood.

That is, that Jesus is the Son of God. The genuineness of this text has been called in question by some, because it is wanting in the Syriac version, as it also is in the Arabic and Ethiopic versions; and because the old Latin interpreter has it not; and it is not to be found in many Greek manuscripts; nor cited by many of the ancient fathers, even by such who wrote against the Arians, when it might have been of great service to them: to all which it may be replied, that as to the Syriac version, which is the most ancient, and of the greatest consequence, it is but a version, and a defective one. The history of the adulterous woman in the eighth of John, the second epistle of Peter, the second and third epistles of John, the epistle of Jude, and the book of the Revelations, were formerly wanting in it, till restored from Bishop Usher's copy by De Dieu and Dr. Pocock, and who also, from an eastern copy, has supplied this version with this text. As to the old Latin interpreter, it is certain it is to be seen in many Latin manuscripts of an early date, and stands in the Vulgate Latin edition of the London Polyglot Bible: and the Latin translation, which bears the name of Jerom, has it, and who, in an epistle of his to Eustochium, prefixed to his translation of these canonical epistles, complains of the omission of it by unfaithful interpreters. And as to its being wanting in some Greek manuscripts, as the Alexandrian, and others, it need only be said, that it is to be found in many others; it is in an old British copy, and in the Complutensian edition, the compilers of which made use of various copies; and out of sixteen ancient copies of Robert Stephens's, nine of them had it: and as to its not being cited by some of the ancient fathers, this can be no sufficient proof of the spuriousness of it, since it might be in the original copy, though not in the copies used by them, through the carelessness or unfaithfulness of transcribers; or it might be in their copies, and yet not cited by them, they having Scriptures enough without it, to defend the doctrine of the Trinity, and the divinity of Christ: and yet, after all, certain it is, that it is cited by many of them; by Fulgentius (z), in the beginning of the "sixth" century, against the Arians, without any scruple or hesitation; and Jerom, as before observed, has it in his translation made in the latter end of the "fourth" century; and it is cited by Athanasius (a) about the year 350; and before him by Cyprian (b), in the middle, of the "third" century, about the year 250; and is referred to by Tertullian (c) about, the year 200; and which was within a "hundred" years, or little more, of the writing of the epistle; which may be enough to satisfy anyone of the genuineness of this passage; and besides, there never was any dispute about it till Erasmus left it out in the, first edition of his translation of the New Testament; and yet he himself, upon the credit of the old British copy before mentioned, put it into another edition of his translation. The heavenly witnesses of Christ's sonship are, <p>the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. The "Father" is the first Person, so called, not in, reference to the creatures, angels, or men, he is the Creator, and so the Father of; for this is common to the other two Persons; but in reference to his Son Jesus Christ, of whose sonship he bore witness at his baptism and transfiguration upon the mount. The "Word" is the second Person, who said and it was done; who spoke all things out of nothing in the first creation; who was in the beginning with God the Father, and was God, and by whom all things were created; he declared himself to be the Son of God, and proved himself to be so by his works and miracles; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-61.htm">Mark 14:61</a>, &amp;c. and his witness of himself was good and valid; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-13.htm">John 8:13</a>; and because it is his sonship that is, here testified of, therefore the phrase, "the Word", and not "the Son", is here used. "The Holy Ghost" is the third Person, who proceeds from the Father, and is also called the Spirit of the Son, who testified of, Christ's sonship also at his baptism, by descending on him as a dove, which was the signal given to John the Baptist, by which he knew him, and bare record of him, that he was the Son of God. Now the number of these witnesses was three, there being so many persons in the Godhead; and such a number being sufficient, according to law, for the establishing of any point: to which may be added, that they were witnesses in heaven, not to the heavenly inhabitants, but to men on earth; they were so called, because they were in heaven, and from thence gave out their testimony; and which shows the firmness and excellency of it, it being not from earth, but from heaven, and not human, but divine; to which may be applied the words of Job, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19</a>; it follows, <p>and these three are one; which is to be understood, not only of their unity and agreement in their testimony, they testifying of the same thing, the sonship of Christ; but of their unity in essence or nature, they being the one God. So that, this passage holds forth and asserts the unity of God, a trinity of persons in the Godhead, the proper deity of each person, and their distinct personality, the unity of essence in that they are one; a trinity of persons in that they are three, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and are neither more nor fewer; the deity of each person, for otherwise their testimony would not be the testimony of God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-9.htm">1 John 5:9</a>; and their distinct personality; for were they not three distinct persons, they could not be three testifiers, or three that bare record. This being a proper place, I shall insert the faith of the ancient Jews concerning the doctrine of the Trinity; and the rather, as it agrees with the apostle's doctrine in words and language, as well as in matter. They call the three Persons in the Godhead three degrees: they say (d), <p>"Jehovah, Elohenu (our God), Jehovah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>; these are the three degrees with respect to this sublime mystery, in the beginning Elohim, or God, created, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, &amp;c.'' <p>And these three, they say, though they are distinct, yet are one, as appears by what follows (e): <p>"come see the mystery of the word; there are three degrees, and every degree is by itself, yet they are all one, and are bound together in one, and one is not separated from the other.'' <p>Again, it is said (f), <p>"this is the unity of Jehovah the first, Elohenu, Jehovah, lo, all of them are one, and therefore: called one; lo, the three names are as if they were one, and therefore are called one, and they are one; but by the revelation of the Holy Spirit it is made known, and they by the sight of the eye may be known,  , "that these three are one": and this is the mystery of the voice which is heard; the voice is one, and there are three things, fire, and Spirit, and water, and all of them are one in the mystery of the voice, and they are but one: so here, Jehovah, Elohenu, Jehovah, they are one, the three,  forms, modes, or things, which are one.'' <p>Once more (g), <p>"there are two, and one is joined unto them, and they are three; and when the three are one, he says to them, these are the two names which Israel heard, Jehovah, Jehovah, and Elohenu is joined unto them, and it is the seal of the ring of truth; and when they are joined as one, they are one in one unity.'' <p>And this they illustrate by the three names of the soul of man (h); <p>"the three powers are all of them one, the soul, spirit, and breath, they are joined as one, and they are one; and all is according to the mode of the sublime mystery,'' <p>meaning the Trinity. <p>"Says R. Isaac (i) worthy are the righteous in this world, and in the world to come, for lo, the whole of them is holy, their body is holy, their soul is holy, their Spirit is holy, their breath is holy, holy are these three degrees "according to the form above".--Come see these three degrees cleave together as one, the soul, Spirit, and breath.'' <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> one.</span><p>(h) See Joh 8:13,14 <p>(i) Agree in one.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_john/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm" title="For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.">1 John 5:7</a>. By means of the witness of the Spirit, water and blood also attain to the position of witnesses. As such John now adduces them in connection with the Spirit, in order by the weight of this threefold witness to confirm the truth that the Son of God, who is identical with Jesus, is the Messiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> which begins the verse means neither: “jam vero” (Grotius, Calov), nor: “hence” (Meyer), nor: “consequently” (Baumgarten-Crusius), but: “<span class="ital">for.</span>” This connection with the foregoing is explained by the fact that the truth of the testimony of the Holy Ghost (who is the truth itself) is strengthened by the circumstance that it is not He alone that bears witness, but that with Him the water and the blood bear witness also, as the two elements by means of which the atonement took place (similarly Lücke);[312] de Wette unnecessarily supplies: “and, humanly considered, the witness is also true, <span class="ital">for.</span>” Paulus connects <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-9.htm" title="If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.">1 John 5:9</a>, as consequent, with this verse as antecedent: “because there are three, etc., then, if, etc., the witness of God is much greater.” This construction, which is contrary to the style of John, is the more to he rejected as an erroneous idea arises from it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τρεῖς εἰσιν οἱ μαρτυροῦντες</span>] The masculine is used because the three that are mentioned are regarded as concrete witnesses (Lücke, etc.), but not because they are “types of men representing these three” (Bengel),[313] or symbols of the Trinity (as they are interpreted in the Scholion of Matthaei, p. 138, mentioned in the critical notes). It is uncertain whether John brings out this triplicity of witnesses with reference to the well-known legal rule, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm" title="At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm" title="But if he will not hear you, then take with you one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.">Matthew 18:16</a>, etc., as several commentators suppose. It is not to be deduced from the present that <span class="greekheb">ὕδωρ</span> and <span class="greekheb">αἷμα</span> are things still at present existing, and hence the sacraments, for by means of the witness of the Spirit the whole redemptive life of Christ is permanently present, so that the baptism and death of Jesus—although belonging to the past—prove Him constantly to be the Messiah who makes atonement for the world (so also Braune). The participle <span class="greekheb">οἱ μαρτυροῦντες</span>, instead of the substantive <span class="greekheb">οἱ μάρτυρες</span>, emphasizes more strongly the activity of the witnessing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ τὸ αἷμα</span>] All these three expressions have here, of course, the same meaning as previously.[314]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ οἱ τρεῖς εἰς τὸ ἕν <span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸΣΙΝ</span></span></span>] Luther inaccurately: “and these three are one;” <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ἝΝ</span></span></span> is the one specific object of the witness; “<span class="ital">the three are directed to this one</span>,” namely, in their thus unanimous witness.

Luther says in reference to them: “It appears as if this verse was inserted by the orthodox against the Arians, <span class="ital">which, however, cannot suitably be done</span>, because both here and there he speaks not of witnesses in heaven, but of witnesses on earth.” With this most modern commentators agree, with the exception of Besser and Sander. It is true that, if we consider the contents of the <span class="ital">whole</span> Epistle, the idea of the three witnesses in heaven may be brought into connection with something or other that appears in the Epistle; but it does not follow from this that that idea has here a suitable or even a necessary place. This plainly is not the case, so much the more, as neither in what follows nor in what immediately precedes, with which <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm" title="For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.">1 John 5:7</a> is closely connected by <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, is there the slightest reference to such a witness of the Trinity. There are clear and intelligible grounds in the foregoing for adducing the three witnesses: <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὓδωρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">αἷμα</span>, but not for adducing the three witnesses: <span class="greekheb">ὁ πατήρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα ἅγιον</span>; this trinity appears quite unprepared for; but the sequel is also opposed to it, for it makes it unintelligible what witness is meant by the <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρία τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-9.htm" title="If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.">1 John 5:9</a>, whether that of the three in heaven, or that of the three on earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To this it may be added that these two different classes of witnesses appear together quite unconnected; it is said, indeed, that these three witnesses agree in one, but not in what relationship the two threes stand to one another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Besides, however, the idea in itself is utterly obscure; for what are we to understand by a witness <span class="ital">in</span> heaven? Bengel, it is true (with whom Sander agrees), says: “non fertur testimonium in coelo, sed in terra: qui autem testantur, sunt in terra, sunt in coelo; i.e. illi sunt naturae terrestris et humanae, hi autem naturae divinae et gloriosae.” How untenable, however, this is, is shown, on the one hand, in the fact that <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ</span> does not belong to <span class="greekheb">εἰσιν</span>, but rather to <span class="greekheb">μαρτυροῦντες</span>, and the text therefore does not speak of being, but of <span class="ital">bearing witness, in heaven;</span> and, on the other hand, in the fact that according to it the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> which is connected with <span class="greekheb">ὓδωρ</span> and <span class="greekheb">αἷμα</span> must be regarded as something earthly and human.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is further the un-Johannean character of the diction, as by John <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος</span>, and similarly <span class="greekheb">ὁ πατήρ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὁ υἱός</span>, are certainly conjoined, but never <span class="greekheb">ὁ πατήρ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος</span>; Sander avails himself of the assumption, which is certainly very easy, of a <span class="greekheb">ἅπαξ λεγόμενον</span>; but this is here unwarrantable, for those ideas are so frequently occurring in John—and that mode of conjunction is not accidental, but is grounded on the nature of the case. We see that the interpolator wrote <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, because this suggested itself to him as a genuine Johannean expression, without reflecting that its connection with <span class="greekheb">πατήρ</span> is un-Johannean. Finally, the <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὗτοι οἱ τρεῖς ἕν εἰσι</span> is also strange. Bengel interprets: unum sunt essentia, notitia, voluntate, atque adeo consensu testimonii. Bengel with justice puts the <span class="ital">essentiality</span> first, for it is just this that is denoted by the expression—but just this is unsuitable here, where the subject rather is <span class="ital">the unity of the witness.</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-7.htm" title="For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one....">1 John 5:7-8</a>.

A third testimony, that of the Spirit, is needed to reveal their significance to us and bring it home to our hearts.

The Revisers have only performed an imperative duty in excluding it from both text and margin. External and internal evidence are alike overwhelmingly against the passage. A summary of both will be found in Appendix D. But there are three facts, which every one should know, and which alone are enough to shew that the words are an interpolation. (1) They are not found in a single Greek MS. earlier than the fourteenth century. (2) Not one of the Greek or Latin Fathers who conducted the controversies about the doctrine of the Trinity in the third, fourth, and first half of the fifth centuries ever quotes the words. (3) The words occur first towards the end of the fifth century in Latin, and are found in no other language until the fourteenth century.

Now, since this most brilliant passage has again and again come under my consideration, I will first enter into a gleaning of <span class="ital">criticisms</span>, and will bring forward some chief points[15] from my Apparatus, according to the order of the subjects there discussed; by which critics may, if they please, be invited to a more full discussion of the matters of which we have there spoken, as the truth shall require: but the last of those subjects will lead us to a much more pleasing contemplation, that of <span class="ital">interpretation</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[15] These, indeed (although regularly inserted in the second Edition of the Appar. Crit. by Burk), I did not think fit to omit in this remarkable passage, as I did in the case of the other critical annotations. My doing so will, I am confident, he pardoned, or even welcomed, by those readers who are not possessed of the App. Crit.—E. B.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The only Greek MSS., <span class="ital">in any form</span>, which support the words from <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ Πατὴρ</span>, to <span class="greekheb">μαρτυροῦντες ἐν τῇ γῇ</span>, are—1. The Cod. Montfortianus at Dublin, palpably copied from the <span class="ital">modern</span> Latin Vulgate [as the fact, that the articles before <span class="greekheb">πατὴρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, and <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> are clumsily omitted, shows], and brought forward as an authority to compel Erasmus to insert the words: Erasmus terms it Codex Britannicus. 2. Cod. Ravianus of Berlin, a transcript from the Complutensian Polyglot, imitating even its misprints. 3. A MS. at Naples, with the words added in the margin by a recent hand. 4. Cod. Ottobonianus 298, in the Vatican, a Greek and Latin MS. of the 15th century, in which the Greek is a mere accompaniment of the Latin, and is quite peculiar (ex. gr. <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</span>). The words were first <span class="ital">edited</span> in Greek by the Complut. Editors, 1514, A.D.; and then by Erasmus, not until his third Ed., 1522, A.D. And so, through Stephens and the Elzevirs, the Rec. Text has adopted them. <span class="ital">All</span> the old Versions, as well as Greek MSS., reject them. The oldest copy of the Latin Vulg. containing them is Wizanburgensis, 99, of the 8th century: also the codex in the monastery of H. Trinity of Cava, near Naples, of the 8th century: also Cod, Toletanus: also Cod. Demidovianus of the 12th century. But Cod. Amiatinfus and the <span class="ital">oldest</span> MSS. of the Vulg. omit them. All the Greek Fathers omit them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A Schorium, quoted in Matthæi, seems to me to account for the origin of the words, which probably did not arise from fraud: <span class="greekheb">οἱ τρεῖς δὲ εἶπεν ἀρσενικῶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι σύμβολα ταῦτα τῆς τριάδος</span>, “He uses <span class="greekheb">τρεῖς</span> in the <span class="ital">Masculine</span>, because these things (the Spirit, the water, and the blood) are symbols of the Trinity.” This also is plainly the reference of Cyprian, 196, “De Patre et Filio et Spiritu Sancto Scriptum est, Et hi tres unum sunt.” There is plainly in the <span class="ital">genuine</span> words, which use <span class="greekheb">τρεῖς</span> in the masc., though the antecedents to which it refers are neuter, some <span class="ital">mystery</span> or symbol; and that the Trinity was the truth meant, seems not an unnatural inference. The more recent Latin Vulg. embodied in the <span class="ital">text</span> what was probably a <span class="ital">marginal</span> comment, made not without reason.—E.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I. Many persons confine their critical investigations within the limits of this one passage; or at any rate wish to commence them with this passage. They act as though any one should begin the study of Geometry with squaring the circle. Such persons scarcely find ground on which to stand; but he who has penetrated through other intricacies, will be able to find a way here also, and to set at rest the minds of others, as far as they are teachable. Here it is only by changing the course that the harbour is gained: the present passage requires a peculiar method of treatment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>II. Not a few of those, who rightly and religiously defend this very expression, are too eager in seeking out and employing supports even of such a kind as have no strength. That has occurred to a distinguished man, Leonard Twells, whose miscellaneous production Wolf has translated from English into Latin, and with a few corrections, has put forth on this passage, pp. 300–313. I read and attentively considered Twells before the publication of my Apparatus: Wherefore, when I proceeded with more of self-distrust than he did, I did not do so without good reason, and I would have the reader imagine that there is matter for deliberation. I am not aware that anything new needs particularly to be supplied: I will mention a few points, which bear upon the subject.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>III. As the <span class="ital">Complutensian editors</span>, on the authority of Latin manuscripts, omitted in ch. 2 the former part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-14.htm" title="And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:">1 John 5:14</a>, and in ch. 5 the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-8.htm" title="And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.">1 John 5:8</a>, although they found them in Greek manuscripts, so they restored this very seventh verse, although not contained in the Greek manuscripts; thus they allowed themselves singular liberty in this Epistle. The undisguised confession of Stunica, respecting the Latin manuscripts here employed, is of more weight than all suspicion respecting two Greek Vatican manuscripts, one of which did not contain the passage, while the other suggested it to Stunica himself, or his colleagues. That the Spanish editors here followed the Vatican copy, Erasmus does not plainly assert, as Twells understands him; he only says, <span class="ital">if I am not mistaken</span>. If Amelotus afterwards read the sentence in the Vatican Manuscript, we must see that it does not in this instance Latinize.[16]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[16] That is, Bengel suspects that the <span class="ital">Greek</span> of the Vatican MS., <span class="ital">if</span> indeed it contains, as Amelotus says, this passage as to the three heavenly witnesses, must be interpolated from the <span class="ital">Latin</span> MSS., and not from original Greek MSS.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>IV. Erasmus obtained from Britain, by the instrumentality of some one or other, a leaf. He himself distrusted it: he related the causes of his distrust, which were not unreasonable. Nothing but mere spontaneous credulity can make from this source an adequate (reliable) <span class="ital">British</span> manuscript. The Complutensian editors gave <span class="ital">one</span> Greek version of the sentence from Latin writers; the British writer brought forward by Erasmus gave <span class="ital">another</span>; the Greek translator of the Council of Lateran <span class="ital">another</span>; the interpolator of the Montfortian Manuscript <span class="ital">another</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>V. That the sentence was read by <span class="ital">the Stephens</span> in no Greek manuscript, the margin of the Latin Bible of Robert (Stephens) of itself proves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is altogether unnecessary to quote the editions of the Stephens and the others. All the rest followed Erasmus and the Complutensian edition in omitting or expressing the sentence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>VI. There is no great number of Greek manuscripts in which the epistles, for instance those of John, are contained: and of those which are now extant in considerable numbers, with very few exceptions none exceed the age of a thousand years; the rest are considerably, or even much more, recent. Therefore it is the less remarkable, that the sentence in Greek is scarcely found at present in the Greek manuscripts; and I have ascertained that we must add to these the royal <span class="ital">Hafniensian</span> Manuscript, the <span class="ital">Ebnerian</span>, and all those <span class="ital">of Paris</span> (Journal des Savans, June 1720), and many, which the celebrated <span class="ital">La Croze</span> (in his History of Christianity in India, p. 316, 2d Edit. Germ.) says that he has seen. In the Florentine manuscripts, which that illustrious man, <span class="ital">John Lamius</span>, mentions in his book respecting the learning of the Apostles, ch. 13, there are found twelve which contain the General Epistles, and yet are without this clause; but all of them were written after the ninth century, We ought, on the other hand, to value the more highly the supplementary authority of that most ancient Version, <span class="ital">the Latin Vulgate</span>,[17] from which this sentence was read and quoted by many fathers in a continued series, and afterwards was introduced into the copies of other languages, and at the present time is extant in the Latin manuscripts of the New Testament.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[17] In the absence of the oldest Greek MSS. we have a valuable substitute for them in the Vulgate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is conjectured, but without any reason, from his silence, that <span class="ital">Valla</span> had read the clause in his Greek manuscripts. Valla also passed over (without notice) a remarkable difference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm" title="This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.">1 John 5:6</a>, where in the Greek copies the reading is <span class="greekheb">τὸ Πνεῦμα</span> (<span class="ital">the Spirit</span>), in the Latin, <span class="ital">Christus</span> (<span class="ital">Christ</span>). And in ch. 2, Valla had without doubt read in the Greek copies the former part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-14.htm" title="And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:">1 John 5:14</a>, which is wanting in the Latin copies;[18] and yet he passes it over in silence [et tamen in pausâ est]. He has been very sparing in his notes on this Epistle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[18] Some MSS. of Vulg. omit <span class="greekheb">ἔγραψα ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πατ</span>. to <span class="greekheb">ἀρχῆς</span>. In Beza’s Latin, the last clause of the 13th ver., “scribo vobis, pueruli,” etc., is the first clause of ver. 14.—E.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Council of <span class="ital">Lateran</span>, in that sentence, <span class="ital">as it is found in</span> SOME <span class="ital">copies</span>, does not refer to the whole of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm" title="For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.">1 John 5:7</a>, but to the clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-8.htm" title="And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.">1 John 5:8</a>, <span class="ital">and these three are one:</span> which clause, being met with in ALL the Greek copies, even of itself demonstrates that the Council is not speaking of Greek, but of Latin manuscripts, of which SOME only have the clause in question.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">Montfortian</span>, or <span class="ital">Dublin</span>, or <span class="ital">Hibernian</span> copy, to which so much weight is attached in certain quarters on account of this clause, is new, and Latinizes; being written in the West, as is proved by the Latin division into chapters. That the <span class="ital">Berlin</span> Manuscript is of no weight apart from the Complutensian editors, the candour of the people of Berlin admits.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>VIII. To the Greek Fathers, who did not read the clause, is to be added <span class="ital">Germanus</span> of Constantinople, as his View of Ecclesiastical Affairs shows. The negative argument, in such an inquiry, cannot be rejected. It is of no weight in the case of one or two ecclesiastical writers only; it is of weight in the case of a great number, when they omit a clause so remarkable, and so singularly adapted to decide controversies. If the Africans in such numbers quote it, how is it that the Asiatics in as many instances refrain from quoting it? The latter did not read it; the former did.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>XIX. <span class="ital">John Lamius</span>, in the treatise already quoted, pp. 260, 266, 284, mentions the <span class="ital">Latin</span> copies of the Florentines which do or do not contain the sentence. Moreover, so great is the antiquity, and so great the authority of the Latin Version, wherever Tertullian, Cypria[19], and a portion only, but these forming a continuous series, of the Fathers follow it, that we are fully justified in depending upon it, and are not compelled to remain in suspense, although it is not yet clearly ascertained, what the following ages read in different parts of the East. They who have at hand those more abstruse versions are easily led to disparage too much the <span class="ital">Latin</span> Version, which is too much extolled by the Romanists.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[19] yprian (in the beginning and middle of the third century: a Latin father). Ed. Steph. Baluzii, Paris. 1726.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>XXI. The Florentine Manuscript, and that Laurentian one [= Amiatinus] which we have quoted from Burnet, is the same, if I mistake not, with that which <span class="ital">John Lamius</span> describes in the book quoted, p. 265. Other Latin manuscripts of the Florentines are added, which have that <span class="ital">order</span> of the verses, pp. 258, 268, 285. A writer also of the eighth century, <span class="ital">Etherius</span>, Bishop of Axima in Spain, has it, who in his first book against Elipandus, reviewing a great part of this Epistle, thus sets forth the two verses: <span class="ital">Because there are three, who bear witness on earth, the water and the blood and the flesh; and these three are one: and there are three, who bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit; and these three are one in Christ Jesus. Cornelius Jansenius</span>, in his Commentary on the Harmony of the Gospels, chapter 144, has imitated those who follow this reading, whether manuscripts or Latin Fathers. <span class="ital">The seventh verse</span>, in the judgment of Cameron, <span class="ital">is to be enclosed in a parenthesis, and the sixth to be joined with the eighth</span>. There is no need of a parenthesis: the sixth verse is of itself connected with the eighth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>XXII. That Manuel Calecas, a DOMINICAN, and the Lectionary of the Greeks, in this place undoubtedly interpolated, edited by VENETIANS, follow the authority of the Vulgate translation, is by no means surprising. The Armenians formerly did the same thing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>XXIII. That <span class="ital">Basil the Great</span> made use of rare (that is, having a few copies much resembling one another, which were peculiar in their class) manuscripts of the Epistles, is plain from the Apparatus, p. 690; and he lays open to us a trace of this dictum of John, when, in his fifth book against Eunomius, he says: <span class="ital">God and the Word and the Spirit, one Deity, and alone to be adored</span>. It is scarcely possible for more weight to be assigned to <span class="ital">the Dialogue</span>, which is attributed to <span class="ital">Maximus</span>, than is assigned to it in my Apparatus. That author undoubtedly owes his knowledge of the clause to the Latin copies of the Africans: whether he found it afterwards in Greek copies, is for the consideration of the learned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now I wish the reader attentively to compare together the <span class="ital">great number</span> of manuscripts, which Gerard of Mastricht brings together in his Notes on this passage, and <span class="ital">the fourteen Greek witnesses</span> which Twells enumerates in the 302d page of Wolf, and, on the other side, the things which I have supplied instead, in the 3d and subsequent paragraphs. You will say that an essential service will be rendered by him who shall prove, by any means whatever, that there are in existence even but <span class="ital">one</span> or two witnesses of Greek authority. He who shall bring forward credible witnesses from Greek antiquity, will deserve the gratitude of the Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>XXV. They who defend the clause are not therefore necessarily bound to know, or to bring forward, the cause why it is wanting in so many copies. Let the cause of the omission be less certain: still the omission, and moreover the genuineness of the clause also, is certain. He who has lost and found a choice treasure, even though he knows not how it was lost, yet recognises and recovers it. The suspicion of an hiatus in this passage, arising from a similarity of ending, will, as I think, be slow in coming to an end. I frequently, throughout this work, notice what influence similarity of ending is accustomed to have in the production of hiatus; but that this cause cannot possibly avail in the present instance, I have, unless I am mistaken, proved in the Apparatus, p. 765 [Ed. ii. p. 474]. But another, and not unreasonable conjecture, as to the manner in which the clause came to be expunged, is subjoined in the same place. On the other hand, it can by no means be regarded as a patch stitched on by the Latin Fathers, who are, some wanting the clause itself, others rejoicing in it; some known, others unknown or lost; some of great antiquity, others more recent. Indulge suspicions in every way; but you will effect nothing. At so early a period, so seriously, so universally, through such a perpetual series of ages, do they bring it forward.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>XXVIII. This last thesis leads us to the exigesis of this most precious passage, in which the 7th verse, when compared (1st) with the context of the whole Epistle, and especially (2d) with the 8th verse, is vindicated, upon the strongest grounds of internal probability.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1.) There are some who think that it is not easy to ascertain the design and arrangement of this Epistle: but if we examine it with simplicity, this will be laid open to us without any violence. In this letter, or rather treatise (for a letter is sent to the absent; but here the writer seems to have been among those to whom he was writing), St John designs to confirm the happy and holy communion of the faithful with God and Jesus Christ, by showing the marks [<span class="ital">gnorismata</span>, by which they may be known] of their most blessed state.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There are three parts:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> THE EXORDIUM, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;...">1 John 1:1-4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> THE DISCUSSION, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1 John 1:5</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-12.htm" title="He that has the Son has life; and he that has not the Son of God has not life.">1 John 5:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> THE CONCLUSION, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-13.htm" title="These things have I written to you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God....">1 John 5:13-21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let the text itself be consulted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the Exordium the apostle establishes authority for his own preaching and writing from the appearance of the Word of Life; and clearly points out his design (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-3.htm" title="For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous....">1 John 5:3-4</a>). The Conclusion (that we may at once clear out of the way this point) corresponds with the Exordium, more fully explaining the same design, a recapitulation of those Marks being made by the thrice-repeated <span class="ital">we know</span>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-18.htm" title="We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not....">1 John 5:18-20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Discussion itself contains two parts, treating—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I.&emsp;&emsp;Separately,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a</span>.&emsp;&emsp;Of communion with God, in the light, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all....">1 John 1:5-10</a> :<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">b</span>.&emsp;&emsp;Of communion with the Son, in the light, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

See above on Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-12.htm" title="I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.">1 John 2:12</a>. Sometimes there is a previous allusion in some preceding part, and a recapitulation in a subsequent part. Every part treats of the Divine benefit, and the duty of the faithful: and the duty is derived from the benefit by the most befitting inferences, of love towards God, of the imitation of Jesus Christ, of the love of the brethren: and although many things may appear to be repeated without order, yet these same inferences are formed in the most methodical manner, by regarding the subject in a different point of view from different causes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The seventh verse therefore contains a recapitulation, which not only treats of the Father and the Son, but also of the Spirit. What the sun is in the universe, the needle in the mariner’s compass, or the heart in the body, that is the 7th verse of chapter 5 in this discussion. First take an edition without this verse, and then an edition which contains it; and you will easily perceive what is required by the whole tenor of John’s discourse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2.) The connection of the verses is indissoluble, in this text: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm" title="This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.">1 John 5:6</a>. <span class="ital">This is He who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ, not in water only, but in water and blood: and it is the Spirit which beareth witness; because the Spirit is truth</span>. 7. <span class="ital">Because there are three that bear witness on earth, the spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree in one</span>. 8. <span class="ital">And there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father and the Word and the Spirit; and these three are one</span>. 9. <span class="ital">If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lest any confusion should arise, we remind the reader, that that which is spoken of by us in the further consideration of this passage, as <span class="ital">the</span> 7<span class="ital">th verse</span>, is that which treats of those who bear witness <span class="ital">on earth</span>; and that <span class="ital">the</span> 8<span class="ital">th verse</span> is that which treats of those who bear witness <span class="ital">in heaven</span>. And we take for granted this 8th verse, partly as already confirmed by critical arguments in the Apparatus, and partly as about to be further confirmed by exegetical arguments.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For those who bear witness are three,</span> and thus constitute full legal testimony (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). It will be assumed here, without discussion, that the remainder of this verse and the first clause of verse 8 are spurious. Words which are not contained in a single Greek uncial manuscript, nor in a single Greek cursive earlier than the fourteenth century (the two which contain the passage being evidently translated from the Vulgate), nor are quoted by a single Greek Father during the whole of the Trinitarian controversy, nor are found in <span class="accented">any</span> authority until late in the fifth century, cannot be genuine. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>There are three that bear record (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;).<p>Lit., three are the witnessing ones.<p>The Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.<p>These words are rejected by the general verdict of critical authorities. For the details of the memorable controversy on the passage, the student may consult Frederick Henry Scrivener, "Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament;" Samuel P. Tregelles, "An Account of the Printed Text of the Greek New Testament;" John Selby Watson, "The Life of Richard Porson, M.A.;" Professor Ezra Abbot, "Orme's Memoir of the Controversy on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm">1 John 5:7</a>;" Charles Foster, "A New Plea for the Authenticity of the Text of the Three Heavenly Witnesses," or "Porson's Letters to Travis Eclectically Examined," Cambridge, 1867. On the last-named work, Scrivener remarks, "I would fain call it a success if I could with truth. To rebut much of Porson's insolent sophistry was easy, to maintain the genuineness of this passage is simply impossible." Tregelles gives a list of more than fifty volumes, pamphlets, or critical notices on this question. Porson, in the conclusion of his letters to Travis, says: "In short, if this verse be really genuine, notwithstanding its absence from all the visible Greek manuscripts except two (that of Dublin and the forged one found at Berlin), one of which awkwardly translates the verse from the Latin, and the other transcribes it from a printed book; notwithstanding its absence from all the versions except the Vulgate, even from many of the best and oldest manuscripts of the Vulgate; notwithstanding the deep and dead silence of all the Greek writers down to the thirteenth, and of most of the Latins down to the middle of the eighth century; if, in spite of all these objections, it be still genuine, no part of Scripture whatsoever can be proved either spurious or genuine; and Satan has been permitted for many centuries miraculously to banish the 'finest passage in the New Testament,' as Martin calls it, from the eyes and memories of almost all the Christian authors, translators, and transcribers." </body></html>
