The testimony of two or three credible witnesses, according to the law of Moses, was deemed sufficient to prove any matter of fact; and indeed human affairs in general, even the most important, are conducted and determined by depending on the testimony of men.

The real Christian has seen his guilt and misery, and his need of such a Saviour. He has seen the suitableness of such a Saviour to all his spiritual wants and circumstances. He has found and felt the power of the word and doctrine of Christ, humbling, healing, quickening, and comforting his soul. He has a new disposition, and new delights, and is not the man that he formerly was. Yet he finds still a conflict with himself, with sin, with the flesh, the world, and wicked powers. But he finds such strength from faith in Christ, that he can overcome the world, and travel on towards a better. Such assurance has the gospel believer: he has a witness in himself, which puts the matter out of doubt with him, except in hours of darkness or conflict; but he cannot be argued out of his belief in the leading truths of the gospel. Here is what makes the unbeliever's sin so awful; the sin of unbelief. He gives God the lie; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son. It is in vain for a man to plead that he believes the testimony of God in other things, while he rejects it in this. He that refuses to trust and honour Christ as the Son of God, who disdains to submit to his teaching as Prophet, to rely on his atonement and intercession as High Priest, or to obey him as King, is dead in sin, under condemnation; nor will any outward morality, learning, forms, notions, or confidences avail him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If we receive the witness of men - As we are accustomed to do, and as we must do in courts of justice, and in the ordinary daily transactions of life. We are constantly acting on the belief that what others say is true; that what the members of our families, and our neighbors say, is true; that what is reported by travelers is true; that what we read in books, and what is sworn to in courts of justice, is true. We could not get along a single day if we did not act on this belief; nor are we accustomed to call it in question, unless we have reason to suspect that it is false. The mind is so made that it must credit the testimony borne by others; and if this should cease even for a single day, the affairs of the world would come to a pause.<p>The witness of God is greater - Is more worthy of belief; as God is more true, and wise, and good than people. People may be deceived, and may undesignedly bear witness to that which is not true - God never can be; men may, for sinister and base purposes, intend to deceive - God never can; people may act from partial observation, from rumors unworthy of credence - God never can; people may desire to excite admiration by the marvelous - God never can; people have deceived - God never has; and though, from these causes, there are many instances where we are not certain that the testimony borne by people is true, yet we are always certain that that which is borne by God is not false. The only question on which the mind ever hesitates is, whether we actually have his testimony, or certainly know what he bears witness to; when that is ascertained, the human mind is so made that it cannot believe that God would deliberately deceive a world. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>.<p>For this is the witness of God ... - The testimony above referred to - that borne by the Spirit, and the water, and the blood. Who that saw his baptism, and heard the voice from heaven, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>, could doubt that he was the Son of God? Who that saw his death on the cross, and that witnessed the amazing scenes which occurred there, could fail to join with the Roman centurion in saying that this was the Son of God? Who that has felt the influences of the Eternal Spirit on his heart, ever doubted that Jesus was the Son of God? Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>. Any one of these is sufficient to convince the soul of this; all combined bear on the same point, and confirm it from age to age. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_john/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

"The testimony of the Father is, as it were, the basis of the testimony of the Word and of the Holy Spirit; just as the testimony of the Spirit is, as it were, the basis of the testimony of the water and the blood" [Bengel].<p>for&#8212;This principle applies in the present case, FOR, &c.<p>which&#8212;in the oldest manuscripts, "because He hath given testimony concerning His Son."

The witness of a sufficient number of credible men, of men of good character and report, is always admitted in any case, and in any court of judicature; it was allowed of in the law of Moses; everything was proved and established hereby; upon this men were justified or condemned, cognizance was taken of men's sins, and punishment inflicted, yea, death itself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>; and even in this case concerning the Son of God, his coming into the world, and the dignity of his person, the testimony of men is credited; as that of the wise men, who declared that the King of the Jews was born, and his star had been seen in the east, which Herod himself gave credit to, and upon it summoned the chief priests, and inquired of them where he should be born; and also of the shepherds, who testified to the appearance of angels, who told them that there was then born a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord, and who also related that they themselves saw the infant at Bethlehem; and especially of John the Baptist, whose testimony was true, and could not be objected to by the Jews themselves, who sent to him, before whom he bore a plain and faithful witness. Now if an human testimony may be, and is received, <p>the testimony of God is greater; more valuable, surer, and to be more firmly depended on, since it must be infallible; for God can neither deceive, nor be deceived: <p>for this is the witness of God, which he hath testified of his Son; even the witness of the Spirit, the water, and the blood, is the testimony, not of men, but of God; the Gospel, attended with the Spirit of God, is the testimony of God; and so the ordinances of baptism and the Lord's supper, which bear witness of Christ, are not of men, but of God; and especially the witness of the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, must be the testimony of God, since, though three persons, they are one God; particularly the witness which God the Father testified of his Son Jesus Christ at his baptism and transfiguration, must be allowed to be the testimony of God, and far greater than any human testimony, and therefore to be received. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.</span><p>(10) He shows by an argument of comparison, of what great weight the heavenly testimony is, that the Father has given of the Son, to whom agrees both the Son himself and the Holy Spirit.<p>(k) I conclude correctly: for the testimony which I said is given in heaven, comes from God, who sets forth his Son.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_john/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-9.htm" title="If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.">1 John 5:9</a> brings out the greatness of the witness of God, and our obligation to accept it.

The sentence, if completed, would run: If we receive the witness of men because it is of some value, much more must we receive the witness of God, as it has a much greater value (comp. A.

The conjunction <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span>, as frequently, is not dubitative.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Brückner justly says, in opposition to Baur: “The witness of men is only alluded to on the side of its judicial value; there is not assumed to be in it an import which would be equal to that of the witness of God by water and blood and spirit.”[315]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΜΑΡΤΥΡΊΑ ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> is here used quite generally; the more particular definition is only given by the sequel (so also Düsterdieck).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ΑὝΤΗ ἘΣΤῚΝ Ἡ ΜΑΡΤΥΡΊΑ ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>] With <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ</span></span></span> it seems necessary to supply a thought to which it refers; Lücke supplies the thought: “if we accept the witness of God, we must believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;” Düsterdieck, with whom Braune agrees: “a witness of God now really exists, namely this …;” but such a supplement is not necessary if we suppose that the clause beginning with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ</span></span></span> is intended to give the reason of the contrast of the human and of the <span class="ital">divine</span> witness which here appears, in <span class="ital">this</span> sense: “I say, <span class="greekheb">ἡ μαρτυρία τοῦ θεοῦ</span>, for …”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the reading: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ</span></span></span> (instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἭΝ</span></span></span>) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΜΑΡΤΎΡΗΚΕ ΠΕΡῚ ΤΟῦ ΥἹΟῦ ΑὐΤΟῦ</span></span></span>, which is attested by the best manuscripts, this second <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ</span></span></span> may be taken as causal particle, in which case <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑὝΤΗ</span></span></span> would be referred to the witness spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-6.htm" title="This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood.
