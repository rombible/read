They would receive it, if good for them. And as good-will to men was proclaimed from heaven, so good-will to men, particularly to the brethren, must be in the hearts of those who go to God and heaven. He who thus follows Christ, dwells in Him as his ark, refuge, and rest, and in the Father through him. This union between Christ and the souls of believers, is by the Spirit he has given them. A man may believe that God is gracious before he knows it; yet when faith has laid hold on the promises, it sets reason to work. This Spirit of God works a change; in all true Christians it changes from the power of Satan to the power of God. Consider, believer, how it changes thy heart. Dost not thou long for peace with God? Wouldst thou not forego all the world for it? No profit, pleasure, or preferment shall hinder thee from following Christ. This salvation is built upon Divine testimony, even the Spirit of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him - If we are truly his children, and ask in a proper manner.

The present is not used instead of the future (Grotius); the subject is here not something future, but what constantly occurs in the life of believers.

This verse is so closely connected with the preceding one, that not more than a comma or semicolon should be placed between them. When a good conscience gives us boldness towards God our prayers are granted, for children in such relations to their heavenly Father cannot ask anything which He will refuse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And whatsoever we ask</span>] The ‘and’ is probably epexegetic, as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-20.htm" title="For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.">1 John 3:20</a></span>, and explains the special character of our boldness.

It may be a long time before we see the results of our prayer; but it is granted at once. As S. Augustine says, ‘He who gave us love cannot close His ears against the groans and prayers of love’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because we keep his commandment</span>] This should certainly be plural, <span class="ital">commandments</span>: previous English Versions have the plural, and there seems to be no trace of a various reading, so that one suspects a misprint in the edition of 1611. ‘Because’ depends upon ‘receive’, not upon ‘have boldness’: we receive because we are loyal. This is in harmony with the Gospel and with Scripture generally: ‘We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and <span class="ital">do His will, him He heareth</span>’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-31.htm" title="Now we know that God hears not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and does his will, him he hears.">John 9:31</a>); ‘The Lord is far from the wicked, but He heareth the prayer of the righteous’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-29.htm" title="The LORD is far from the wicked: but he hears the prayer of the righteous.">Proverbs 15:29</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/66-18.htm" title="If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:...">Psalm 66:18-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/27-8.htm" title="For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has gained, when God takes away his soul?...">Job 27:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats....">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>).
