Or he has not attained to, or has not retained, a spiritual, experimental acquaintance and communion with him. For, certainly, when a person sins, or transgresseth any known law of God, the loving eye of his soul is not fixed upon God; neither doth he then experimentally know him, whatever he did in time past. Macknight thinks it probable that “some of the heretical teachers, condemned by the apostle in this epistle, to make their disciples believe that their opinions were derived from Christ, boasted their having seen and conversed with him during his ministry on earth, consequently that they knew his doctrine perfectly. But the apostle assured his children that, if these teachers, who avowedly continued in sin, had ever seen or conversed with Christ, they had utterly mistaken both his character and his doctrine.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:3-10 The sons of God know that their Lord is of purer eyes than to allow any thing unholy and impure to dwell with him. It is the hope of hypocrites, not of the sons of God, that makes allowance for gratifying impure desires and lusts. May we be followers of him as his dear children, thus show our sense of his unspeakable mercy, and express that obedient, grateful, humble mind which becomes us. Sin is the rejecting the Divine law. In him, that is, in Christ, was no sin. All the sinless weaknesses that were consequences of the fall, he took; that is, all those infirmities of mind or body which subject man to suffering, and expose him to temptation. But our moral infirmities, our proneness to sin, he had not. He that abides in Christ, continues not in the practice of sin. Renouncing sin is the great proof of spiritual union with, continuance in, and saving knowledge of the Lord Christ. Beware of self-deceit. He that doeth righteousness is righteous, and to be a follower of Christ, shows an interest by faith in his obedience and sufferings. But a man cannot act like the devil, and at the same time be a disciple of Christ Jesus. Let us not serve or indulge what the Son of God came to destroy. To be born of God is to be inwardly renewed by the power of the Spirit of God. Renewing grace is an abiding principle. Religion is not an art, a matter of dexterity and skill, but a new nature. And the regenerate person cannot sin as he did before he was born of God, and as others do who are not born again. There is that light in his mind, which shows him the evil and malignity of sin. There is that bias upon his heart, which disposes him to loathe and hate sin. There is the spiritual principle that opposes sinful acts. And there is repentance for sin, if committed. It goes against him to sin with forethought. The children of God and the children of the devil have their distinct characters. The seed of the serpent are known by neglect of religion, and by their hating real Christians. He only is righteous before God, as a justified believer, who is taught and disposed to righteousness by the Holy Spirit. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil. May all professors of the gospel lay these truths to heart, and try themselves by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whosoever abideth in him - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a>. The word here employed (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  meno&#772;n) properly means to remain, to continue, to abide. It is used of persons remaining or dwelling in a place, in the sense of abiding there permanently, or lodging there, and this is the common meaning of the word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-11.htm">Matthew 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-10.htm">Mark 6:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-56.htm">Luke 1:56</a>, "et saepe." In the writings of John, however, it is quite a favorite word to denote the relation which one sustains to another, in the sense of being united to him, or remaining with him in affection and love; being with him in heart and mind and will, as one makes his home in a dwelling. The sense seems to be that we have some sort of relation to him similar to that which we have to our home; that is, some fixed and permanent attachment to him. We live in him; we remain steadfast in our attachment to him, as we do to our own home. For the use of the word in John, in whose writings it so frequently occurs, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-38.htm">John 5:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-56.htm">John 6:56</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-27.htm">John 15:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-10.htm">1 John 2:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-14.htm">1 John 2:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-17.htm">1 John 2:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27-28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-6.htm">1 John 3:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-24.htm">1 John 3:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm">1 John 4:12-13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-15.htm">1 John 4:15-16</a>. In the passage before us, as in his writings generally, it refers to one who lives the life of a Christian, as if he were always with Christ, and abode with him. It refers to the Christian considered as adhering steadfastly to the Saviour, and not as following him with transitory feelings, emotions, and raptures.<p>(See the supplementary note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>. We abide in Christ by union with him. The phrase expresses the continuance of the union; of which see in the note as above. Scott explains, "whoever abides in Christ as one with him and as maintaining communion with him. ')<p>It does not of itself necessarily mean that he will always do this; that is, it does not prove the doctrine of the perseverance of the saints, but it refers to the adherence to the Saviour as a continuous state of mind, or as having permanency; meaning that there is a life of continued faith in him. It is of a person thus attached to the Saviour that the apostle makes the important declaration in the passage before us, that he does not sin. This is the third argument to show that the child of God should be pure; and the substance of the argument is, that "as a matter of fact" the child of God is not a sinner.<p>Sinneth not - There has been much difference of opinion in regard to this expression, and the similar declaration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>. Not a few have maintained that it teaches the "doctrine of perfection," or that Christians may live entirely without sin; and some have held that the apostle meant to teach that this is always the characteristic of the true Christian. Against the interpretation, however, which supposes that it teaches that the Christian is absolutely perfect, and lives wholly without sin, there are three insuperable objections:<p>(1) If it teaches that doctrine at all, it teaches that all Christians are perfect; "whosoever abideth in him," "whosoever is born of God," "he cannot sin," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>.<p>(2) this is not true, and cannot be held to be true by those who have any just views of what the children of God have been and are. Who can maintain that Abraham, or Isaac, or Jacob; that Moses, David, or Job; that Peter, John, or Paul, were absolutely perfect, and were never, after their regeneration, guilty of an act of sin? Certainly they never affirmed it of themselves, nor does the sacred record attribute to them any such perfection. And who can affirm this of all who give evidence of true piety in the world? Who can of themselves? Are we to come to the painful conclusion that all who are not absolutely perfect in thought, word, and deed, are destitute of any religion, and are to be set down as hypocrites or self-deceivers? And yet, unless this passage proves that "all" who have been born again are absolutely perfect, it will not prove it of anyone, for the affirmation is not made of a part, or of what any favored individual may be, but of what everyone is in fact who is born of God.<p>(3) this interpretation is not necessary to a fair exposition of the passage. The language used is such as would be employed by any writer if he designed to say of one that he is not characteristically a sinner; that he is a good man; that he does not commit habitual and willful transgression. Such language is common throughout the Bible, when it is said of one man that he is a saint, and of another that he is a sinner; of one that he is righteous, and of another that he is wicked; of one that he obeys the law of God, and of another that he does not. John expresses it strongly, but he affirms no more in fact than is affirmed elsewhere. The passage teaches, indeed, most important truths in regard to the true Christian; and the fair and proper meaning may be summed up in the following particulars:<p>(a) He who is born again does not sin habitually, or is not habitually a sinner. If he does wrong, it is when he is overtaken by temptation, and the act is against the habitual inclination and purpose of his soul. If a man sins habitually, it proves that he has never been renewed.<p>(b) That he who is born again does not do wrong deliberately and by design. He means to do right. He is not willfully and deliberately a sinner. If a man deliberately and intentionally does wrong, he shows that he is not actuated by the spirit of religion. It is true that when one does wrong, or commits sin, there is a momentary assent of the will; but it is under the influence of passion, or excitement, or temptation, or provocation, and not as the result of a deliberate plan or purpose of the soul. A man who deliberately and intentionally does a wrong thing, shows that he is not a true Christian; and if this were all that is understood by "perfection," then there would be many who are perfect, for there are many, very many Christians, who cannot recollect an instance for many years in which they have intentionally and deliberately done a wrong thing. Yet these very Christians see much corruption in their own hearts over which to mourn, and against which they earnestly strive; in comparing themselves with the perfect law of God, and with the perfect example of the Saviour, they see much in which they come short.<p>(c) He who is born again will not sin finally, or will not fall away. "His seed remaineth in him," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>. See the notes at that verse. There is a principle of grace by which he will ultimately be restrained and recovered. This, it seems to me, is fairly implied in the language used by John; for if a person might be a Christian, and yet wholly fall away and perish, how could it be said with any truth that such a man "sinneth not;" how that "he doth not commit sin;" how that "his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin?" Just the contrary would be true if this were so.<p>Whosoever sinneth - That is, as explained above, habitually, deliberately, characteristically, and finally. - Doddridge. "Who habitually and avowedly sinneth."<p>Hath not seen him, nor known him - Has had no just views of the Saviour, or of the nature of true religion. In other words, cannot be a true Christian. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

The ideal of the Christian. The life of sin and the life of God mutually exclude one another, just as darkness and light. In matter of fact, believers do fall into sins (1Jo 1:8-10; 2:1, 2); but all such sins are alien from the life of God, and need Christ's cleansing blood, without application to which the life of God could not be maintained. He sinneth not so long as he abideth in Christ.<p>whosoever sinneth hath not seen him&#8212;Greek perfect, "has not seen, and does not see Him." Again the ideal of Christian intuition and knowledge is presented (Mt 7:23). All sin as such is at variance with the notion of one regenerated. Not that "whosoever is betrayed into sins has never seen nor known God"; but in so far as sin exists, in that degree the spiritual intuition and knowledge of God do not exist in him.<p>neither&#8212;"not even." To see spiritually is a further step than to know; for by knowing we come to seeing by vivid realization and experimentally.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="bld">sinneth, </span> he meaneth the same thing as afterwards by <span class="ital">committeth sin:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm" title="He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning.

The solution of the apparent contradiction must not be sought by giving the word <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτάνειν</span> here a meaning different from what it has elsewhere (<span class="ital">e.g.</span> = persistere in peccato; or with Capellus = sceleratum esse, or = to commit peccata mortalia); nor even by appealing to the apostle’s <span class="ital">ideal</span> mode of conception (de Wette, Düsterdieck; substantially also Weiss and Brückner[205]), for “John has here to do with <span class="ital">real</span> cases, and wants to indicate to us the marks by which it may be known whether a man loves the Lord or not, whether he is a child of God or of the wicked one” (Sander), as is clear from <span class="greekheb">φανερά ἐστι</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>; but only in the fact that the Christian, who is a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΈΚΝΟΝ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span>, bears the contradiction in himself that he, on the one hand, it is true, still actually sins, but, on the other hand, is also actually free from sin—so free from it that he <span class="ital">cannot</span> sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.">1 John 3:9</a>); he has actually broken with sin, so that in his most inner nature he is in the most decided opposition to it; yet at the same time he finds it in himself, and indeed in such a way that he still actually sins (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-10.htm" title="If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.">1 John 1:10</a>), but inasmuch as he confesses it, and experiences the forgiving and saving love of the faithful God towards him (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm" title="If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.">1 John 1:9</a>), and with all earnestness practises the <span class="greekheb">ἁγνίζειν ἑαυτόν</span>, it ever loses more and more its power over him, and thus it results that it is no longer sin, but opposition to it (as something foreign to his nature), that determines his conduct of life; and hence the apostle may with perfect justice say, that he who abides in Christ does not sin (so also Braune[206]), which is quite the same as when Paul says: <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις ἐν Χριστῷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καινὴ κτίσις</span>· <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἀρχαῖα παρῆλθεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span>, <span class="greekheb">γέγονε καινὰ τὰ πάντα</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The antithesis expressed in the first clause is even more sharply brought out in the second, inasmuch as John does not say: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Πᾶς Ὁ ἉΜΑΡΤΆΝΩΝ</span> … <span class="greekheb">Οὐ ΜΈΝΕΙ ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span>, but: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΧ ἙΏΡΑΚΕΝ ΑὐΤΌΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΟὐΔῈ ἜΓΝΩΚΕΝ ΑὐΤΌΝ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Πᾶς Ὁ ἉΜΑΡΤΆΝΩΝ</span></span></span> is every one who leads a life in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑ</span></span></span>, and therefore has not come out of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΌΣΜΟς</span></span></span> into the number of God’s children;[207] such an one, says John, hath not seen, neither known <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> Christ. Lücke takes the perfects <span class="greekheb">ἑώρακεν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἔγνωκεν</span> in present signification, the former in the meaning of “the present possession of the experience,” the latter in the meaning of “the present possession of previously obtained knowledge;” but this is not rendered necessary by the context, and hence the perfects are to be retained as such, although it must be admitted that John is considering the result as one that continues into the present. The meaning of the two verbs in their relation to one another is very differently explained; according to some commentators, <span class="greekheb">ἑώρακεν</span> signifies something inferior (Semler, Baumgarten-Crusius, Lücke in his 1st ed.), according to others, something superior (Socinus, Neander, Frommann, p. 223), to <span class="greekheb">ἔγνωκεν</span>; with the former view <span class="greekheb">οὐδέ</span> is taken as = “and still less,” with the latter as = “and not as much as;” both are incorrect, for a difference of degree is in no way suggested; yet the two expressions are not to be regarded as synonymous, so that <span class="greekheb">ἔγνωκε</span> would only be added to bring out the <span class="ital">spiritual meaning</span> of <span class="greekheb">ἑώρακεν</span> (Düsterdieck), for although <span class="greekheb">οὐδέ</span> can neither be necessarily “disjunctive” (Lücke, 1st ed.) nor “conjunctive” (Lücke, 2d ed.), yet the form of the clauses shows, inasmuch as the object is put along with each verb, that <span class="greekheb">οὐδέ</span> here has a stronger emphasis, and that John wanted to express by the two verbs two distinct ideas. In order to determine these, the original signification of the words must be retained; <span class="greekheb">ὁρᾷν</span> signifies neither “the mere historical knowledge of Christ” (Lücke), nor the perseverantia communionis cum Christo (Erdmann), and <span class="greekheb">γινώσκειν</span> signifies neither “the experience of the heart,” nor even “love,” but even here <span class="greekheb">ὁρᾷν</span> means <span class="ital">to see</span>, and <span class="greekheb">γινώσκειν</span> <span class="ital">to know;</span> but the seeing of Christ takes place when the immediate consciousness of the glory of Christ has dawned upon us, so that the eye of our soul beholds Him as He is in the totality of His nature; the knowing of Him when by means of inquiring consideration the right understanding of Him has come to us, so that we are clearly conscious not only of His nature, but also of His relation to us.[208]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[205] When Weiss (and Brückner agreeing with him) says “that John here represents the Christian life as according to its nature it is and <span class="ital">ought to be</span>,” the expression of the apostle is explained by him also from its idealism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[206] Besser appropriately says: “Every one who abides in Christ, to whom He once belongs, does not sin, but says ‘No’ to sin, which belongs to the old man, and resists its alien power. A Christian does not <span class="ital">do</span> sin, but he <span class="ital">suffers</span> it. His will, his Christian Ego, is not at one with sin. <span class="ital">Hatred of sin</span> is the common mark of the children of God; <span class="ital">love of sin</span> the common property of the children of the devil.” Augustine’s explanation: “in quantum in Christo manet, in tantum non peccat,” is unsatisfactory, because it would thereby appear as if the inner life of the Christian was something divided in itself; but it is more correct when he says: “Etsi infirmitate labitur, peccato tamen non consentit, quia potius gemendo luctatur.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[207] Ebrard says this explanation is opposed to the context, because “even from ver. 4 the subject is such as are Christians, but are lacking in holiness, and it is only in ver. 6 that it is stated how far such Christians cannot be regarded as truly regenerate;” but (1) do not the <span class="ital">un</span>regenerate Christians still belong to the <span class="greekheb">κίσμος</span>? and (2) does not that explanation refer precisely to the close of the 6th verse?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[208] With this interpretation that of Sander, who interprets <span class="greekheb">ἑώρακεν</span> of “spiritual intuition or beholding,” and <span class="greekheb">ἔγνωκεν</span> of the “knowledge obtained more by reflection along the lines of dialectic and inquiry,” as well as that of Myrberg, according to which the former signifies the “immediata perceptio Christi spirituali modo homini se manifestantis,” the latter the “perdurans cognitio atque intelligentia,” are in substantial agreement. Braune, it is true, assents to this view, but he erroneously thus defines the thought of the apostle: “Every one who sins, and inasmuch as he sins, is one in whom the seeing and knowing of Christ is a thing of the past, but does not continue and operate into the present,” for John plainly says of him who sins that he <span class="ital">has</span> not seen or known Christ. When Erdmann defines <span class="greekheb">ἔγνωκεν</span> as the cognitio Christi, quae et intuitu et intellectu non solum personae Christi verum etiam totius ejus operis indolem complectitur, this is in so far unsuitable, as the intuitu belongs precisely to the <span class="greekheb">ἑώρακεν</span>. Very unsatisfactory is Ebrard’s explanation, that <span class="greekheb">ὁρᾷν</span> is “the seeing of Christ as the <span class="ital">light</span>, <span class="greekheb">γινώσκειν</span> the <span class="ital">loving</span> knowledge.” The difference between <span class="greekheb">ὁρᾷν</span> and <span class="greekheb">γινώσκειν</span> appears also in this, that in the former the operating activity is represented rather on the side of the object, which presents itself to the eye of the soul; in the latter, rather on the side of the subject, which this verb makes the subject of consideration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-6.htm" title="Whoever stays in him sins not: whoever sins has not seen him, neither known him.">1 John 3:6</a>. This seems a stark contradiction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm" title="And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's only, but also for the sins of the whole world.">1 John 2:2</a>. (1) St. Augustine first limits the statement: “In quantum in ipso manet, in tantum non peccat,” and then narrows the idea of “sin” by defining it as “not loving one’s brother” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>). (2) St. Bernard (<span class="ital">De Nat. et Dign. Am. Div.</span> vi.) compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-17.htm" title="Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.">Romans 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-20.htm" title="Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.">Romans 7:20</a> : “secundum hoc quod natus est ex Deo, id est secundum interioris hominis rationem, in tantum non peccat, in quantum peccatum quod corpus mortis foris operatur, odit potius quam approbat, semine spiritualis nativitatis quo ex Deo natus est eum interius conservante”. (3) Romanists limit “sin” to “mortal sin”. (4) Many commentators say that St. John is thinking only of the ideal. All these simply explain away the emphatic declaration. There is really no contradiction, and the Apostle’s meaning appears when account is taken of the terms he employs with accurate precision. In the earlier passage he says that there is indwelling sin in the believer. The sinful principle (<span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span>) remains, and it manifests its presence by lapses from holiness—occasional sins, definite, isolated acts of sin. This is the force ot the aorists, <span class="greekheb">ἁμάρτητε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἁμάρτῃ</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1 John 2:1</a>. Here he uses the present <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτάνειν</span> (varied by <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖν τὴν ἁμαρτίαν</span>) with the implication of <span class="ital">continuance in sin</span>. The distinction between present and aorist is well exemplified by Matt. 6 11: <span class="greekheb">δὸς σήμερον</span> as contrasted with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-3.htm" title="Give us day by day our daily bread.">Luke 11:3</a> : <span class="greekheb">δίδου τὸ καθʼ ἡμέραν</span>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm" title="And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.">Matthew 14:22</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐμβῆναι</span> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ προάγειν</span>. The distinction was obvious to St. John’s Greek readers, and they would feel no difficulty when he said, on the one hand: <span class="greekheb">ἐάν τις ἁμάρτῃ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Παράκλητον ἔχομεν</span>, and, on the other: <span class="greekheb">πᾶς ὁ ἁμαρτάνων οὐχ ἑώρακεν αὐτόν</span>. The believer may fall into sin but he will not walk in it. “Hath not seen Him,” because he is “in the darkness” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all....">1 John 1:5-7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">Whosoever abideth</span>] Better, <span class="bld">Every one that</span> <span class="ital">abideth:</span> we have the same Greek form of expression here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-23.htm" title="Whoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father: he that acknowledges the Son has the Father also.">1 John 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1 John 2:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-3.htm" title="And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure....">1 John 3:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-9.htm" title="Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God....">1 John 3:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-15.htm" title="Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.">1 John 3:15</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-7.htm" title="Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, and knows God.">1 John 4:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm" title="Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves him that begat loves him also that is begotten of him.">1 John 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-4.htm" title="For whatever is born of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.">1 John 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-18.htm" title="We know that whoever is born of God sins not; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not.">1 John 5:18</a>, and it is better to mark this in translation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sinneth not</span>] The Christian sometimes sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us....">1 John 1:8-10</a>). The Christian abides in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>). He who abides in Christ does not sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-6.htm" title="Whoever stays in him sins not: whoever sins has not seen him, neither known him.">1 John 3:6</a>). By these apparently contradictory statements put forth one after another S. John expresses that internal contradiction of which every one who is endeavouring to do right is conscious. What S. John delivers as a series of aphorisms, which mutually qualify and explain one another, S. Paul puts forth dialectically as an argument. ‘If what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-20.htm" title="Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.">Romans 7:20</a>). And on the other hand, ‘I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whosoever sinneth, hath not seen him, neither known him</span>] Or, <span class="bld">every one that</span> <span class="ital">sinneth, hath not seen Him, neither</span> <span class="bld">knoweth</span> <span class="ital">Him</span>. The second verb is the perfect of the commonest verb in Greek for ‘to see’ (<span class="greekheb">ὁρᾷν</span>), a verb of which S. John uses no tense but the perfect. The third verb, though perfect in form, is present in meaning, ‘I have come to know, I know’ (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm" title="And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.">1 John 2:3</a>). No one who sins has seen Christ or attained to a knowledge of Him. What does S. John mean by this strong statement? It will be observed that it is the antithesis of the preceding statement; but, as usual, instead of giving us the simple antithesis, ‘Every one that sinneth abideth <span class="ital">not</span> in Him’, he expands and strengthens it into ‘Every one that sinneth hath not seen Him, neither come to know Him’. S. John does not say this of every one who commits a sin, but of the habitual sinner (present participle). Although the believer sometimes sins, yet not sin, but opposition to sin, is the ruling principle of his life; for whenever he sins he confesses it, and wins forgiveness, and perseveres with his self-purification.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the habitual sinner does none of these things: sin is his ruling principle. And this could not be the case if he had ever really known Christ. Just as apostates by leaving the Church prove that they have never really belonged to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm" title="They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.">1 John 2:19</a>), so the sinner by continuing in sin proves that he has never really known Christ.—Seeing and knowing are not two names for the same fact: to see Christ is to be spiritually conscious of His presence; to know Him is to recognise His character and His relation to ourselves. For a collection of varying interpretations of this passage see Farrar’s <span class="ital">Early Days of Christianity</span>, II. p. 434, note.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_john/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-6.htm" title="Whoever stays in him sins not: whoever sins has not seen him, neither known him.">1 John 3:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐχ ἁμαρτάνει</span>, <span class="ital">sinneth not</span>) In him the good of righteousness is not overcome by the evil of sin.—<span class="greekheb">οὐχ ἑώρακεν αὐτὸν</span>) <span class="ital">hath not seen Him</span> in spirit; although perhaps, as to personal appearance, <span class="ital">he hath seen</span> Him in the flesh: or even, though he hath seen Him in spirit, at the very moment of sin he becomes such, as though he had never seen Him in any way.—<span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ ἔγνωκεν αὐτὸν</span>, <span class="ital">nor known Him</span>) in truth; although perhaps <span class="ital">he hath</span> formerly <span class="ital">known Him</span> personally.

Just in so far as he abides, he does not sin. Or it may mean that be who abides in Christ cannot deliberately and habitually sin. But then would not St. John have written, "He that abideth in Christ abideth not in sin"? But the main difficulty is in the second half. In what sense is it true that <span class="cmt_word">every one that sinneth hath not seen Christ?</span> In the main two explanations are given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The Greek perfect expresses the present and permanent result of a past action, and is often equivalent to a present. No doubt; and all would be easy if we had only to deal with <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, which means, "he hath come to know," equivalent to "he knoweth." But does <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> ever mean "he seeth," as Alford suggests as the best rendering for a version? If St. John simply means that whoever sins thereby ceases to see and know Christ, he would hardly express himself thus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The fact of the man's sinning proves that his perception and knowledge have been imperfect, if not superficial, or even imaginary; just as the fact of Christians leaving the Church proves that they never were really members of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19</a>). This explanation is preferable. In verse 2 we were told that seeing God will make us like God; and similarly, to see and know Christ make us like Christ. Whoever is unlike Christ, to that extent has not seen nor come to know him. The best of us, it may be, have seen but the hem of his garment. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Abideth<p>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-10</a>.
