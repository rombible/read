Surely we should love those whom God has loved, and so loved. The Holy Spirit, grieved at selfishness, will leave the selfish heart without comfort, and full of darkness and terror. By what can it be known that a man has a true sense of the love of Christ for perishing sinners, or that the love of God has been planted in his heart by the Holy Spirit, if the love of the world and its good overcomes the feelings of compassion to a perishing brother? Every instance of this selfishness must weaken the evidences of a man's conversion; when habitual and allowed, it must decide against him. If conscience condemn us in known sin, or the neglect of known duty, God does so too. Let conscience therefore be well-informed, be heard, and diligently attended to.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue - By mere profession; by merely sayinG that we love each other.

When the venerable John could no longer walk to the meetings of the Church but was borne thither by his disciples, he always uttered the same address to the Church; he reminded them of that one commandment which he had received from Christ Himself, as comprising all the rest, and forming the distinction of the new covenant, "My little children, love one another." When the brethren present, wearied of hearing the same thing so often, asked why he always repeated the same thing, he replied, "Because it is the commandment of the Lord, and if this one thing be attained, it is enough" [Jerome].<p>in word&#8212;Greek, "with word &#8230; with tongue, but in deed and truth."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_john/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> q.d.

Which though it holds good of love to God, and to Jesus Christ, yet here is to be understood of love to the brethren, as the context shows; and so the Syriac version reads, "let us not love one another in word", &amp;c. that is, without the heart, or with a double heart; speaking one thing with the lip, and designing another thing in the heart; speaking peaceably with the mouth, and with the heart laying wait; or we should not love in this manner "only"; and so the Arabic version of De Dieu adds. It is very lawful, and right to express our love to one another, and to all men in words, to give good words, and use courteous language, and speak in a kind, tender, and affectionate manner, and especially to persons in distress; but this should not be all, it will be of no avail to say to such, be warmed and filled, and give them nothing but these good words, nothing to warm and fill them with; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15</a>; <p>but in deed and in truth; for true love is a laborious and operative grace, hence we read of the work and labour of love; it shows itself by the saints serving one another, in spirituals; as by bearing one another's burdens, forbearing with, and forgiving one another, praying for each other, and building up one another on their most holy faith; exhorting each other to the duties of religion, and not suffering sins upon one another, but admonish in love, and restore with meekness; and in temporals, distributing to the necessities of the saints, ministering: to them of their worldly substance, and supplying their daily wants: and this is loving "in deed", or "in work"; this is actual love, love in fact, and what is apparent and evident: and it is "in truth", when it is in reality, and not in show only; and when it is cordially and heartily done, with cheerfulness, and without grudging. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{18}</span> My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</span><p>(18) Christian charity stands not in word but in deed, and proceeds from a sincere affection.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_john/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm" title="My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.">1 John 3:18</a>. <span class="ital">True</span> love proves itself by deed.

The article serves “to vivify the expression” (Lücke): <span class="ital">the</span> tongue as the particular member for expression of the word. It is unnecessary, nay, “contrary to the text” (Düsterdieck), with Beza, Lange, Sander, etc., to supply “<span class="greekheb">μόνον</span>” with <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπῶμεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; for <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπᾷν λόγῳ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. in itself expresses the <span class="ital">mere apparent love.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἐν ἔργῳ καὶ ἀληθεία</span>] Instead of the <span class="ital">Rec.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἔργῳ</span>, we must read <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἔργῳ</span>; according to de Wette, the two readings are synonymous; according to Lücke, <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἔργῳ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλ</span>. has more of “adverbial nature” than <span class="greekheb">ἔργῳ καὶ ἀληθείᾳ</span>; “in <span class="greekheb">τῷ λόγῳ</span> the apostle is considering more the way in which love expresses itself, in <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἔργῳ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλ</span>. he is considering more the form and fashion of it;” the preposition suggested itself to the apostle because the <span class="ital">work</span>, as being the realization of love, stands in an inner relationship to it, “is the element in which love moves” (Düsterdieck).[231] <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἔργον</span> are frequently in the N.

V., <span class="ital">neither with</span> <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">tongue</span>. This is more accurate, for in the Greek ‘word’ has no article and ‘tongue’ has: both are datives of the instrument, and the article marks the tongue as the special instrument of the hypocritical love. Is there any difference between loving in word and loving with the tongue? And is there any difference between loving in deed and loving in truth? The answer must be the same to both questions. The oppositions between ‘word’ and ‘deed’ and between ‘tongue’ and ‘truth’ are so exact as to lead us to believe that there <span class="ital">is</span> a difference. To love in word is to have that affection which is genuine as far as it goes, but which is so weak that it never gets further than affectionate words: such love is opposed, not to truth, but to loving <span class="ital">acts</span>. To love with the tongue is to profess an affection which one does not feel, which is sheer hypocrisy: it is opposed, not to deeds, but to <span class="ital">truth</span>. It may shew itself also in hypocritical acts, done (as Bede points out) not with the wish to do good, but to win praise, or to injure others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in deed and in truth</span>] Omit the second ‘in’: the preposition is not repeated in the Greek.

This introduces a false antithesis, like "Do not dig with a stick, but dig in the earth." (For the Hebraic <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> to express the instrument, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-10.htm">Revelation 13:10</a>.) "Nor yet with the tongue" is not a tautological addition. One may love in <span class="accented">word</span> only, and yet the affectionate words may be quite sincere; and this is a common case. People say kind things which they mean at the moment, but afterwards they do not take the trouble to act kindly. But to love <span class="accented">with the tongue</span> only is far worse. This is to say kind things which one does not mean, and which one knows to be unreal. Deeds are needed to complete the kind word; truth is needed to correct the insincere tongue. </body></html>
