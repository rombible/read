Surely we should love those whom God has loved, and so loved. The Holy Spirit, grieved at selfishness, will leave the selfish heart without comfort, and full of darkness and terror. By what can it be known that a man has a true sense of the love of Christ for perishing sinners, or that the love of God has been planted in his heart by the Holy Spirit, if the love of the world and its good overcomes the feelings of compassion to a perishing brother? Every instance of this selfishness must weaken the evidences of a man's conversion; when habitual and allowed, it must decide against him. If conscience condemn us in known sin, or the neglect of known duty, God does so too. Let conscience therefore be well-informed, be heard, and diligently attended to.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And hereby - Greek, "by this;" that is, by the fact that we have true love to others, and that we manifest it by a readiness to make sacrifices to do them good.<p>We know that we are of the truth - That we are not deceived in what we profess to be; that is, that we are true Christians. To be of the truth stands opposed to cherishing false and delusive hopes.<p>And shall assure our hearts before him - Before God, or before the Saviour. In the margin, as in the Greek, the word rendered "shall assure," is "persuade." The Greek word is used as meaning to "persuade," e. g., to the reception and belief of truth; then to persuade anyone who has unkind or prejudiced feelings toward us, or to bring over to kind feelings, "to conciliate," and thus to pacify or quiet. The meaning here seems to be, that we shall in this way allay the doubts and trouble of our minds, and produce a state of quiet and peace, to wit, by the evidence that we are of the truth. Our consciences are often restless and troubled in view of past guilt; but, in thus furnishing the evidence of true piety by love to others, we shall pacify an accusing mind, and conciliate our own hearts, and persuade or convince ourselves that we are truly the children of God. See Robinson, Lexicon, sub voce &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;  peitho&#772;, I. b. In other words, though a person's heart may condemn him as guilty, and though he knows that God sees and condemns the sins of his past life, yet the agitations and alarms of his mind may be calmed down and soothed by evidence that he is a child of God, and that he will not be finally condemned. A true Christian does not attempt to conceal the fact that there is much for which his own heart and conscience might justly accuse him but he finds, notwithstanding all this, evidence that he is a child of God, and he is persuaded that all will be well. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. hereby&#8212;Greek, "herein"; in our loving in deed and in truth (1Jo 3:18).<p>we know&#8212;The oldest manuscripts have "we shall know," namely, if we fulfil the command (1Jo 3:18).<p>of the truth&#8212;that we are real disciples of, and belonging to, the truth, as it is in Jesus: begotten of God with the word of truth.

The "heart," as the seat of the feelings, is our inward judge; the conscience, as the witness, acts either as our justifying advocate, or our condemning accuser, before God even now.

By the saints loving one another in deed and in truth, they know, as the cause is known by the effect, that they are of God, who is the true God, the God of truth, and cannot lie, and is truth itself; that they are the children of God, and are born of him, since they love those that are, and every like loves its like; and that they are of Jesus Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life; that they belong to him, are his, since they have his Spirit, as appears by his fruits in them, and this, among the rest, love to the brethren; and that they are his disciples, which others, even all men know, as well as themselves, by their mutual brotherly love; and that they are of the Gospel, which is truth, and the word of truth; that they are begotten, and born again, according to the will and grace of God by it, and are on the side of it, and can do nothing against, but all for it; and that they are true, sincere, and upright persons, true believers in Christ, whose faith works by love, and are real lovers of him, and his, since they love not in word only, but in deed and in truth. <p>And shall assure our hearts before him; or "persuade our hearts": arrive to a full assurance of faith, hope, and understanding, that we are of the truth, do belong to God, are loved by him with an everlasting love, are chosen by him unto salvation, and are his adopted and regenerated ones, having passed from death to life, of which brotherly love is a sure evidence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>. Some render the words "shall pacify", or "make our hearts tranquil": or "quiet"; this only the blood of Christ can do, and does, being sprinkled on the conscience: he only has a quiet mind, or true peace of conscience, that looks to the righteousness of Christ for justification, and deals with his blood for the full and free remission of his sins: it is true indeed, that one that loves his brother heartily and sincerely, has peace of mind in it, though not for it; when, on the other hand, there is no peace to the wicked man, that hates his brother; for where there is envying, malice, hatred, and strife, there is no true peace, pleasure, and comfort, but confusion, uneasiness, distraction, and every evil work. Or this passage may refer to that holy confidence before God, which true believers in Christ, and cordial lovers of the brethren, have; both now at the throne of grace, where they can come with boldness, intrepidity, and freedom, to ask for what they want, and confidently believe they shall receive what is proper and needful for them; and also hereafter, at the throne of judgment, and in the day of judgment, when they shall have boldness, and not be ashamed before the Judge at his coming; who will particularly take notice of their love in feeding, clothing, and visiting the least of his brethren, which he takes as done to himself. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_john/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{19}</span> And hereby we know that we are of the truth, <span class="cverse3">{20}</span> and shall assure our hearts before him.</span><p>(19) He commends charity, by three effects: for first of all, by it we know that we are indeed the sons of God, as he showed before.<p>(20) Therefore it comes that we have a quiet conscience, as on the opposite side he that thinks that he has God for a judge, because he is guilty to himself either he is never or else very rarely quiet, for God has a far sharper sight then we, and judges more severely.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_john/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-19.htm" title="And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him....">1 John 3:19-20</a>.

What, then, is the meaning of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΊΣΟΜΕΝ ΤᾺς ΚΑΡΔΊΑς ἩΜῶΝ</span></span></span>? Plainly <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΊΣΟΜΕΝ</span></span></span> expresses a truth which <span class="ital">we</span> (the subject contained in <span class="greekheb">πείσομεν</span>) impress upon our hearts, so that they are thereby determined to something, which presupposes at least a relative contrast between <span class="ital">us</span> and <span class="ital">our hearts.</span> The verb <span class="greekheb">πείθειν</span> means either to <span class="ital">persuade</span> a person to something, so that he thinks or acts as we wish, or to <span class="ital">convince</span> him of something so that he agrees with our opinion. <span class="ital">Some ancient commentators</span> have interpreted in accordance with the first signification: suadebimus corda nostra, ut studeant proficere in melius; the more particular definition which is added is here clearly quite arbitrary; it is not much better with the explanation of Fritzsche (<span class="ital">Comment. III. de nonnullis Pauli ad Gal. cp. locis</span>): animos nostros flectemus, nempe ad amorem vita factisque ostendendum, or even with the more recent one: anim. n. flectemus sc. ut veram Christi doctrinam tueamur (see Erdmann, p. 129 ff.[235]). It is very common to explain <span class="greekheb">πείθειν</span> here by <span class="ital">placare, to calm, to compose;</span> this, it is true, is in so far inaccurate as <span class="greekheb">πείθειν</span> has not this meaning in itself, but certainly the verb is sometimes used in such a connection that the purpose of the persuasion is the calming of anger or of a similar passion;[236] hence the original meaning of the word passes into the above. This may be the case here also, for the following <span class="greekheb">καταγινώσκῃ</span> shows that the apostle regards our heart as affected with a passion directed against us; then the following <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-20.htm" title="For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.">1 John 3:20</a> (at least the second, for the first may also be the pronoun <span class="greekheb">ὅ τι</span>), is the causal particle = “<span class="ital">because, since.</span>” Taking this view, the sense is: <span class="ital">In the consciousness that we are of the truth, we shall silence the accusation which our heart makes against us, because God is greater than our heart.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If, on the other hand, we take <span class="greekheb">πείθειν</span> in the meaning of <span class="ital">to convince</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> (at least the second) is = “<span class="ital">that;</span>” and the sentence <span class="greekheb">μείζων ἐστὶν ὁ Θεὸς τῆς καρδίας ἡμῶν</span> is the object belonging to <span class="greekheb">πείσομεν</span>; so that the sense is: <span class="ital">If our heart accuses us, we shall bring it to the conviction that God is greater than it.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words <span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, do not point to the “future judgment” (Lücke, de Wette), but to the representation of God in the devotion of the soul, which is peculiar to the Christian. By putting them first, it is brought out that the <span class="greekheb">πείσομεν</span> only occurs in this representation of God (Düsterdieck, Ewald, Brückner, Braune).—<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-20.htm" title="For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.">1 John 3:20</a>. By far the most of the commentators take the <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> with which this verse begins as the particle, either = “<span class="ital">because</span>” or “<span class="ital">that</span>,” and explain the second <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> as epanalepsis of the first. The supposition of the epanalepsis of a particle has, considered in itself, nothing against it, although it very seldom appears in the N. T., but it is only suitable if <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is the objective particle (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-11.htm" title="Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;...">Ephesians 2:11-12</a>);[237] from this it follows that if <span class="greekheb">πείθομεν</span> has the meaning “<span class="ital">to calm</span>,” the first <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is not to be regarded as the particle. Sander, it is true, translates: “we can <span class="ital">calm</span> our heart, <span class="ital">that</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>God is greater,” etc., but this has only sense if before “that” is supplied “with this,” or “inasmuch as we reflect;” such a supplement, however, is arbitrary. Several commentators (Hoogewen, Bengel, Morus, Baumgarten-Crusius, Ewald) regard the first <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> as the pronoun, as also Lachmann (in his large ed.) reads <span class="greekheb">ὅ τι ἐάν</span>. Düsterdieck erroneously asserts (as even Bertheau in the 3d ed. of Lücke’s <span class="ital">Comm.</span> p. 339, Ebrard, and now even Brückner and Braune, have acknowledged) that this form is never found in the N. T.; it is true that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-23.htm" title=" And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men;">Colossians 3:23</a> it is probably not <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τι ἐάν</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἐάν</span> that is to be read, although D*** E J K have the former, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-23.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.">Acts 3:23</a> Tisch. reads <span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἐάν</span> (so also <span class="greekheb">א</span>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>, according to the overwhelming authorities, it is not <span class="greekheb">ὅ τι ἄν</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ὅ τι ἐάν</span>, that must be read (which is admitted by Lachm.

The decision as to which is the correct interpretation depends on the explanation of the following sentence: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ΜΕΊΖΩΝ ἘΣΤῚΝ Ὁ ΘΕῸς Τῆς ΚΑΡΔΊΑς ἩΜῶΝ ΚΑῚ ΓΙΝΏΣΚΕΙ ΠΆΝΤΑ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The old controversy is, whether God is called greater than our heart as <span class="ital">forgiving</span> or as <span class="ital">judging;</span> the <span class="ital">former</span> is the view of Thomas Angl., Luther, Bengel, Morus, Russmeyer, Spener, Noesselt, Steinhofer, Rickli, Baumgarten-Crusius, Sander, Besser, Düsterdieck, Erdmann, Myrberg, Ewald, Brückner, Braune, etc.; the <span class="ital">latter</span> is the view of Calvin, Beza, Socinus, Grotius, a Lapide, Castalio, Hornejus, Estius, Calovius, Semler, Lücke, Neander, Gerlach, de Wette, Ebrard, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If <span class="greekheb">πείθειν</span> is = “<span class="ital">to calm</span>,” then <span class="greekheb">μείζων</span> must refer to the forgiving love of God; Lücke, indeed, gives the following explanation: “after John has said that <span class="ital">only</span> if we are, in active brotherly love, conscious that we are of the truth, shall we calm our hearts in the judgment he adds: for if the contrary is the case, if our conscience accuses us of the want of genuine love, then God is greater than our heart, and before His holiness and omniscience there is no calm for the accusing conscience.” But the assumption of such a declaratio e contrario, which is in no way hinted at, is only an artificial expedient for reconciling contraries. <span class="greekheb">μείζων</span> can only be referred to God as judging, if <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΊΘΕΙΝ</span></span></span> has the meaning “<span class="ital">to persuade.</span>” As Ebrard regards this as the right view, and would begin “<span class="ital">a perfectly independent new sentence</span>” with <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ</span>, he states the meaning as follows: “In the sight of God we shall convince our hearts of this, that if (even) our heart (so prone to self-deception and self-excuse, and therefore <span class="ital">small</span>) accuses us (namely, of not practising love), God, the all-knowing, is greater than our heart, and we shall therefore <span class="ital">so much the less</span> be able to stand before Him.” This interpretation is contradicted, in the first place, by the fact that it separates the second part of the 19th verse from the first, nay, even places it in antithesis to it,[242] whereas such an independence is not only not suggested as belonging to it, but is refuted by the connecting <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span>, and in the second place, by the fact that the thought is in itself inadmissible. According to the representation of the apostle, <span class="ital">we</span> and <span class="ital">our heart</span> are regarded as contrasted with one another, inasmuch as our heart brings a condemning accusation <span class="ital">against us</span>, which plainly refers to the fact that we by our sins have made ourselves liable to the judgment of God; it is not <span class="ital">we</span> therefore that hold out <span class="ital">to our heart</span>, but <span class="ital">our heart</span> that holds out <span class="ital">to us</span>, the judgment of God; how, then, shall <span class="ital">we</span> after this bring <span class="ital">our heart</span> to the conviction that God will condemn us, nay, will condemn us even more than our heart does already? From this it follows that—whatever be the meaning of <span class="greekheb">πείθειν</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μείζων</span> cannot refer to the judicial activity of God. As God is called <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΊΖΩΝ</span></span></span> in comparison with our heart that condemns us, the comparison expresses an opposition; Erdmann: Notioni cordis condemnantis magnitudo Dei comparatur et opponitur; the heart, inasmuch as it condemns us, is like the “hostis, qui nos aggreditur, sed Deus <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΊΖΩΝ</span></span></span> h. e. fortior est, ut hostem illum devincere possit” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm" title="You are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.">1 John 4:4</a>). As this greatness of God, which surpasses the heart, proves itself in this, that in those who are <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ Τῆς ἈΛΗΘΕΊΑς</span></span></span> it overcomes the accusations of the heart, those commentators are right who assign to this verse a comforting tendency, and therefore refer <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΊΖΩΝ</span></span></span> to <span class="ital">the forgiving love;</span> no doubt, it is objected that the thought of God’s omniscience (<span class="greekheb">γινώσκει πάντα</span>[243]) is not able to comfort the man whom conscience accuses, but this can only hold good in reference to those who are not yet <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ Τῆς ἈΛΗΘΕΊΑς</span></span></span>, and not in reference to those of whom John is here speaking, namely, those who in their sincere love to the brethren have the evidence that they are <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚ Τῆς ἈΛΗΘΕΊΑς</span></span></span>.[244] If this is the right interpretation, then it is clear that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΓΙΝΏΣΚΕΙΝ</span></span></span> does not refer to the want of love, but to sin in general, from which even the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΈΚΝΟΝ ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> is not yet free (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1 John 1:8</a> ff.); and this is also indicated by the apostle’s very form of expression, if <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΊΣΟΜΕΝ</span></span></span> is directly connected with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΓΙΝΏΣΚΕΙ</span></span></span>, and if, accordingly, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὅ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΤΙ ἘΆΝ</span></span></span> is to be read (see above), in which case <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ΜΕΊΖΩΝ ἘΣΤΙ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> states the <span class="ital">objective</span> ground of the <span class="greekheb">πείθειν</span>: “<span class="ital">because God is greater than our heart, we therefore</span> (in the consciousness that we are of the truth) <span class="ital">shall calm our hearts before God, however much our heart may accuse us.</span>” This interpretation deserves the preference before that, according to which <span class="greekheb">πείσομεν</span> is = “<span class="ital">to convince</span>,” and <span class="greekheb">ὅτι μείζων κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. the object governed by it, because not only does the purpose of the verse thereby appear, more clearly, but it is not easy to perceive how the conviction of the greatness of God which overcomes the heart should result from the consciousness <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ἘΚ Τῆς ἈΛΗΘΕΊΑς ἘΣΜΈΝ</span></span></span>.[245]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is further to be observed that de Wette makes the <span class="ital">first</span> <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> as causal particle dependent on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΊΣΟΜΕΝ</span></span></span> (= to calm), the <span class="ital">second</span>, on the other hand, on <span class="greekheb">καταγινώσκῃ</span>: “for, if our heart accuses us because God is greater than our heart, He also knows all things;” but this construction is opposed not only by the fact that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> is more naturally taken as copula (Baumgarten-Crusius), but also by the fact that the thought, that our heart condemns us <span class="ital">because</span> God is greater than our heart, is incorrect.[246]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Without adequate ground, Erdmann thinks that <span class="greekheb">καρδία</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-19.htm" title="And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.">1 John 3:19</a> is used in a wider sense than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-20.htm" title="For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.">1 John 3:20</a> (“vertimus <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΊΣΟΜΕΝ ΤᾺς ΚΑΡΔΊΑς</span></span></span>: nobis ipsis persuadebimus”), because there the plural, and here the singular, is used; this change of the number has no influence on the meaning of the word, but the apostle speaks of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΡΔΊΑ</span></span></span> as the object of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΊΘΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, and as the subject of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΓΙΝΏΣΚΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, inasmuch as the heart is the seat or the union of the affections; the Greek commentators explain <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΡΔΊΑ</span></span></span> here as synonymous with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΝΕΊΔΗΣΙς</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[234] Lücke: “Even if it be unadvisable to connect <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. directly with <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span>, so that it appears better, with Lachmann and the old commentators, to put a comma after <span class="greekheb">ἐσμέν</span>, every one must at least admit the connection in the direct succession of the sentences. But then it must also be permitted to take the logical connection thus: In this (vv. 16–18) do we know that we are of the truth. And thus (if we in living love have the assurance that we are of the truth) we shall, etc.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[235] This interpretation is based on the erroneous view that <span class="greekheb">εἶναι ἐκ τῆς ἀληθείας</span> is = veram doctrinam tenere; the former interpretation is contradicted by the fact that if we already know from our love to the brethren that we are of the truth, we do not need for the first time to move our hearts to love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[236] In favour of this we may appeal to the passages cited by Lücke, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-14.htm" title="And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.">Matthew 28:14</a>; Joseph. <span class="ital">Arch.</span> vi. 5, 6 (Samuel), <span class="greekheb">ὑπισχνεῖται καὶ παρακαλέσειν τὸν Θεὸν συγγνῶναι περὶ τούτων αὐτοῖς</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ πείσειν</span>, and the passage in Plutarch, where to <span class="greekheb">ἀπολοίμην</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰ μή σε τιμωρησαίμην</span> the reply runs: <span class="greekheb">ἀπολοίμην</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰ μή σε πείσαιμι</span>, although <span class="greekheb">πείθειν</span> has not in them exactly the meaning of “to calm.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[237] Lücke himself admits that the passages adduced by him in favour of the epanalepsis “have only value for those who take <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> both times not as causal particle, but as conjunction, belonging to <span class="greekheb">πείσομεν</span>;” but thinks that the context makes it necessary to assume the epanalepsis here even for the causal particle; similarly Braune, although without even showing the grammatical justification in any way. Besides, in this construction it is quite overlooked that if the intermediate clause <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν καταγινώσκῃ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is connected with the preceding, the first <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> comes in disturbingly; and if it is connected with the following, the second <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> does so. As in accordance with the thought only the former connection can be the correct one, it is incomprehensible how John should have here interrupted it by <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[238] <span class="greekheb">א</span> has in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1 John 2:5</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἄν</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-13.htm" title="And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.">John 14:13</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὅ τι ἄν</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-16.htm" title="You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.">John 15:16</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὅ τι ἐάν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[239] If it was the apostle’s intention to contrast sharply two different cases, he could do this more definitely if he constructed the first period thus: <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν καταγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν ἡ καρδία</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ πείσομεν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>., <span class="greekheb">ὅτι μείζων κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and the second: <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν δὲ μὴ καταγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν ἡ καρδία</span>. From the fact that he did not do so, it may be concluded that such a sharp contrast was not in his purpose.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[240] That the supposition of an epanalepsis for the causal particle is improper, has been already noticed above; and for the passage before us it is further clear from the fact that if <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is the causal particle, the clause <span class="greekheb">μείζων ἐστὶν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. forms, according to the thought, the conclusion of <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν καταγινώσκῃ</span>, as plainly appears in Lücke when he explains: “Then, if … our conscience accuses us, God is greater than our heart,” etc.—But even the epanalepsis of <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> as objective particle may be doubted; for as the thought <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν καταγινώσκῃ</span> does not form the presupposition for <span class="greekheb">μείζων ἐστὶν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., but for <span class="greekheb">πείσομεν</span>, it is unsuitable to place it in the objective clause dependent on <span class="greekheb">πείσομεν</span>, instead of connecting it with <span class="greekheb">πείσομεν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[241] Düsterdieck, with whom also Braune agrees, appropriately remarks that <span class="greekheb">καταγινώσκειν</span> occupies a middle place between <span class="greekheb">κατηγορεῖν</span>, along with which an <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογεῖν</span> further occurs, and <span class="greekheb">κατακρίνειν</span>, which includes the judicial decree of punishment; comp. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_john/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-19.htm" title="And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him....">1 John 3:19-20</a>. A <span class="ital">crux interpretum</span>. Read <span class="greekheb">τὴν καρδίαν ἡμῶν ὅ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τι ἐάν</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span>), and take the subsequent <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> as “because”. The foregoing exhortation may have awakened a misgiving in our minds: “Am I loving as I ought?” Our failures in duty and service rise up before us, and “our heart condemns us”. So the Apostle furnishes a grand reassurance: “Herein shall we get to know that we are of the Truth, and in His presence shall assure our heart, whereinsoever our heart may condemn us, because, etc.”. The reassurance is two-fold: (1) The worst that is in us is known to God (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Aug.: <span class="ital">Cor tuum abscondis ab homine; a Deo absconde si potes</span>), and still He cares for us and desires us. Our discovery has been an open secret to Him all along. (2) He “readeth everything”—sees the deepest things, and these are the real things. This is the true test of a man: Is the deepest that is in him the best? Is he better than he seems? His failures lie on the surface: is there a desire for goodness deep down in his soul? Is he glad to escape from superficial judgments and be judged by God who “readeth everything,” who sees “with larger other eyes than ours, to make allowance for us all”? <span class="ital">Cf.</span> F. W. Robertson, <span class="ital">Lett.</span> lvi.: “I remember an anecdote of Thomas Scott having said to his curate, who was rather agitated on having to preach before him, ‘Well, sir, why should you be afraid before me, when you are not afraid before God?’ But how very easy it was to answer! He had only to say, God is not jealous, nor envious, nor censorious; besides, God can make allowances”. So Browning:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Thoughts hardly to be packed<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Into a narrow act,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Fancies that broke through language and escaped;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>All I could never be,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>All, men ignored in me,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ</span>, and what matter how we appear <span class="greekheb">ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm" title="Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 6:1</a>.)? <span class="greekheb">πείσομεν</span>, “persuade,’ <span class="ital">i.e.</span> pacify, win the confidence, soothe the alarm, of our heart. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-14.htm" title="And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.">Matthew 28:14</a>. Otherwise: “we shall persuade our heart … that greater is God”. But how can love for the brethren yield this inference? <span class="greekheb">γινώσκει πάντα</span>, “readeth every secret”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-25.htm" title="And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.">John 2:25</a>.

The second <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is then a difficulty and has been dealt with in three ways: (1) It has been ignored as redundant: “For if our heart condemn us, God is greater, etc.” (A.V. fortified by the omission of the participle in some inferior MSS.). (2) An ellipse has been assumed—either of the substantive verb: “because if our heart condemns us, (it is) because God, etc.” (Alford), or of <span class="greekheb">δῆλον</span> (Field, who compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-7.htm" title="For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.">1 Timothy 6:7</a>): “it is plain that God, etc.” (3) <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> has been conjecturally emended into <span class="greekheb">ἔτι</span> (Steph., Bez.): “still greater is God, etc.”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_john/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">And hereby we know</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">Herein we shall know:</span> the ‘and’, though well supported, is probably not genuine, and the evidence for the future as against the present is overwhelming. ‘Herein’ (<span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ</span>) sometimes refers to what follows (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1 John 3:16</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1 John 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm" title="In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.">1 John 4:9</a>), sometimes to what precedes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-5.htm" title="But whoever keeps his word, in him truly is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.">1 John 2:5</a>). Here the latter is the case: by loving in deed and truth we shall arrive at the knowledge that we are morally the children of the Truth. ‘The Truth’ here is almost equivalent to ‘God’. ‘To be of the Truth’ is to have the Truth as the source whence the guiding and formative influences of thought and conduct flow: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-21.htm" title="I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.">1 John 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-47.htm" title="He that is of God hears God's words: you therefore hear them not, because you are not of God.">John 8:47</a>, and especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then?

Certainty is not attainable, and to give all possible variations of reading and rendering would take up too much space. The conclusions adopted here are given as good and tenable, but not as demonstrably right.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and shall assure our hearts</span>] Literally, <span class="ital">and shall</span> <span class="bld">persuade</span> <span class="ital">our hearts</span>. Is this clause <span class="ital">coordinate</span> with ‘we shall know’, or dependent upon it (‘we shall know that we shall assure’)? Probably the former. The meaning is, ‘Herein we shall know that we are of the truth, and herein we shall persuade our heart.’ Authorities are much divided between ‘heart’ (B, Peschito, Thebaic) and ‘hearts’ (<span class="greekheb">א</span>CKL); the former seems preferable. S. John elsewhere always uses the singular both in Gospel and Epistle: it “fixes the thought upon the personal trial in each case” (Westcott). In any case it obviously means, not the <span class="ital">affections</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-3.htm" title="I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die and live with you.">2 Corinthians 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>), but the <span class="ital">conscience</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-37.htm" title="Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brothers, what shall we do?">Acts 2:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-54.htm" title="When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.">Acts 7:54</a>). It is worth noting that the Greek word (<span class="greekheb">καρδία</span>) is cognate with the English ‘heart.’ The substitution of ‘assure’ for ‘persuade’ appears to be somewhat violent, for it is a meaning which the verb (<span class="greekheb">πείθειν</span>) does not in itself possess. But if the context justifies the substitution, because the meaning plainly is ‘persuade our heart <span class="ital">that it need not condemn us</span>’, then the context may speak for itself in the English, as in the Greek. Comp. ‘We will <span class="ital">persuade</span> him and rid you of care’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-14.htm" title="And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.">Matthew 28:14</a>); and ‘having made Blastus their friend’, literally ‘having <span class="ital">persuaded</span> Blastus’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-20.htm" title="And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.">Acts 12:20</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">before him</span>] This is placed first for emphasis in the Greek; <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">before Him</span> <span class="ital">shall assure our hearts</span>. The important thing is that we can quiet our consciences <span class="ital">in the sight of God</span>. The self-deceiver, who is not ‘of the Truth’, but ‘walks in darkness’ hating his brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1 John 2:1</a>), can quiet his heart, ‘because the darkness hath blinded his eyes’: but this is not done ‘before God’.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_john/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-19.htm" title="And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.">1 John 3:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν τούτῳ</span>, <span class="ital">in this</span>) Hence depends <span class="ital">we know and shall tranquilize</span>; and to this refers, <span class="ital">since He is greater</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-20.htm" title="For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.">1 John 3:20</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς ἀληθείας</span>, <span class="ital">of the truth</span>) <span class="ital">Of</span> expresses the beginning or origin: <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a>.

The same word is used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-14.htm" title="And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.">Matthew 28:14</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τὰς καρδίας ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">our hearts</span>) The word <span class="greekheb">συνείδησις</span>, <span class="ital">conscience</span>, is used by Peter and Paul alone of the sacred writers: nor is it used in the Septuagint more than once, and that in another sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm" title="Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>. For the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">לב </span>is rendered <span class="greekheb">καρδία</span>, the heart, for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-44.htm" title="The king said moreover to Shimei, You know all the wickedness which your heart is privy to, that you did to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return your wickedness on your own head;">1 Kings 2:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-38.htm" title="What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all your people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:">1 Kings 8:38</a>. And so John nowhere uses the word <span class="greekheb">συνείδησις</span>, conscience; but here he implies it, in making mention of the heart: for it is the conscience which is tranquilized, and which condemns.
