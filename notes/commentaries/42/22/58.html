He that has once told a lie, is strongly tempted to persist: the beginning of that sin, like strife, is as the letting forth of water. The Lord turned and looked upon Peter. 1. It was a convincing look. Jesus turned and looked upon him, as if he should say, Dost thou not know me, Peter? 2. It was a chiding look. Let us think with what a rebuking countenance Christ may justly look upon us when we have sinned. 3. It was an expostulating look. Thou who wast the most forward to confess me to be the Son of God, and didst solemnly promise thou wouldest never disown me! 4. It was a compassionate look. Peter, how art thou fallen and undone if I do not help thee! 5. It was a directing look, to go and bethink himself. 6. It was a significant look; it signified the conveying of grace to Peter's heart, to enable him to repent. The grace of God works in and by the word of God, brings that to mind, and sets that home upon the conscience, and so gives the soul the happy turn. Christ looked upon the chief priests, and made no impression upon them as he did on Peter. It was not the mere look from Christ, but the Divine grace with it, that restored Peter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57-75</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 22:55-62.

A quarter, or half an hour after, within an hour at least: <p>another saw him; not another maid, but another man, as appears from the answer; though the Syriac and Persic versions leave out the word man, it may be because Matthew and Mark represent the person, on account of whose words Peter denied Christ a second time, to be another maid; but then it is to be observed, that that maid did not speak directly to Peter, as this person did, but to those that were present, or that stood by: and one of these taking the hint from her, looked at him, and said, <p>thou art also of them; of the disciples of Jesus of Nazareth; thou belongest to that company; thou art certainly one of his followers; <p>and Peter said, man, I am not. This was after he had been out into the porch, and had mused upon it, and was come in again, but had not courage enough to withstand the temptation, and especially now, being attacked by a man; and so a second time denies that Christ was his master, or that he was a disciple of his. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them.

And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.">Mark 14:68</a>), he stole back out of the light of the brazier where he had been sitting with the servants, to the gate or vestibule (<span class="ital">pulona</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-71.htm" title="And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.">Matthew 26:71</a>, <span class="ital">proaulion,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-68.htm" title="But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what you say.

Of this second denial St John says, “<span class="ital">they</span> said to him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-25.htm" title="For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.">Luke 18:25</a>); and as the portress was sure to have gossipped about him to the girl who relieved her at her post, the <span class="ital">second</span> denial was due to his being pointed out by the second maid to the group of idlers who were hanging about the door, one of whom was prominent in pressing the charge against him. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-71.htm" title="And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.">Matthew 26:71</a> (</span><span class="greekheb">ἄλλη</span><span class="ital">); <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-69.htm" title="And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.">Mark 14:69</a> (</span><span class="greekheb">ἡ παιδίσκη</span><span class="ital">); <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-25.htm" title="And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself.

Doubtless the second and third charges became more and more general as the news spread among the group. It is much more important to notice the moral law of “linked lies” by which ‘once denied’ always has a tendency to become ‘thrice denied.’ “Whom,” asks St Augustine, “have you ever seen contented with a <span class="ital">single</span> sin?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Man</span>] A mode of displeased address, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-14.htm" title="And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?">Luke 12:14</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/22.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-58.htm" title="And after a little while another saw him, and said, You are also of them.

His very words show the flutter of agitation he was in.</body></html>
