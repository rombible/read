Those who go upon Christ's word, need not fear disappointment. According to the orders given them, the disciples got all ready for the passover. Jesus bids this passover welcome. He desired it, though he knew his sufferings would follow, because it was in order to his Father's glory and man's redemption. He takes his leave of all passovers, signifying thereby his doing away all the ordinances of the ceremonial law, of which the passover was one of the earliest and chief.

The rationalistic interpretation: “sed aliquando vos in coelo mecum gaudiis propriis ac summis perfruemini” (Kuinoel), is purely arbitrary. Jesus means actually a <span class="ital">Passover</span> (specifically such a one, not merely the Messianic feasts in general, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-11.htm" title="And I say to you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-30.htm" title="That you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Luke 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-15.htm" title="And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.">Luke 14:15</a>) in the Messiah’s kingdom, which should hold the same relation to the temporal Passover as that which is perfect (absolute) holds to the incomplete. This corresponds to the idea of the new world (of the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατάστασις</span>, <span class="greekheb">παλιγγενεσία</span>), and of the perfected theocracy in the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν μέλλων</span>.

The <span class="ital">impersonal</span> view (Paulus, Baumgarten-Crusius), according to which the meaning is said to be: till the establishment of the kingdom shall be brought about, is an evasion opposed to the context. Completely without foundation, moreover, Schenkel says that the <span class="ital">adoption of the Gentiles</span> into the divine covenant is the fulfilment of the Old Testament Passover.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-17.htm" title="And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:">Luke 22:17</a> f.

In respect of this, the drinking of the Passover wine was certainly so essential, and, in the consciousness of the person celebrating the rite, so necessary, that the not drinking, and especially on the part of the Host Himself, would have appeared absolutely as contrary to the law, irreligious, scandalous, an interruption which, on the part of Jesus, can hardly be credible. Since then Mark and Matthew, moreover, have nothing at all about a refusal of the wine, but rather do not bring in the assurance, <span class="greekheb">οὐ μὴ πίω κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., until the conclusion of the meal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-25.htm" title="Truly I say to you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.">Mark 14:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-29.htm" title="But I say to you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.">Matthew 26:29</a>; and since Matthew uses the emphatic <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἄρτι</span>, wherein is intimated that Jesus had just drunk with them once more,—the narrative of Luke, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/22-17.htm" title="And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:...">Luke 22:17-18</a>, is to be regarded as not original, and it is to be assumed that Jesus indeed spoke, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/22-15.htm" title="And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer:...">Luke 22:15-16</a>, at the beginning of the meal (in opposition to Kuinoel and Paulus), but that what is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-29.htm" title="But I say to you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.">Matthew 26:29</a> has been removed back by the tradition on account of the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-16.htm" title="For I say to you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.">Luke 22:16</a>, and placed after <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-16.htm" title="For I say to you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.">Luke 22:16</a>, beside which <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-17.htm" title="And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:">Luke 22:17</a> easily appeared as a link, without the necessity of attributing to Luke the construction of a piece of mosaic from a twofold source (as Holtzmann wishes to do), especially as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-17.htm" title="And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:">Luke 22:17</a> is not yet the <span class="ital">cup of the Lord’s Supper</span>. According to Baur, <span class="ital">Evang</span>. p. 482 f., Luke must have been led by 1 Corinthians 10, where, moreover, the <span class="greekheb">ποτήριον τῆς εὐλογίας</span> is emphatically placed first, to distinguish two acts in the Lord’s Supper (comp. also Ritschl, <span class="ital">Evang. Marcion’s</span>, p. 108), one with the leading idea of <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span>, and the other with that of <span class="greekheb">ἀνάμνησις</span>. He must have here represented the first by the help of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-29.htm" title="But I say to you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.">Matthew 26:29</a>. He must thus probably still have expressly brought in the supposed leading idea of <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span>, as Paul also has done in respect of the bread. In general, the use made by Luke of the Pauline <span class="ital">Epistles</span>, which here even Hilgenfeld (comp. Holtzmann, p. 237) considers as unmistakeable, is quite incapable of proof.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/22.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/22-14.htm" title="And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him....">Luke 22:14-18</a>. <span class="ital">Prelude to the Lord’s Supper</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-20.htm" title="Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.">Matthew 26:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-17.htm" title="And in the evening he comes with the twelve.">Mark 14:17</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14-38. </span>The last Supper.<span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>14</span>. <span class="ital">when the hour was come</span>] If the meal was intended to be directly Paschal, this would be “between the two evenings” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-6.htm" title="And you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.">Exodus 12:6</a>); a phrase interpreted by the Jews to mean between three and six, and by the Samaritans to mean between twilight and sunset.

The preparation had been made in the "large upper room," and the Lord and the twelve sat down, or rather reclined on the couches covered with carpets, the tables before them laid with the dishes peculiar to the solemn Passover Supper, each dish telling its part of the old loved story of the great deliverance. There was the lamb the Paschal victim, and the bitter herbs, the unleavened bread and the reddish sweet conserve of fruits - commemorating, it is said, by its color the hard labors of brickmaking, one of the chief burdens of the Egyptian bondage - into which the Blaster dipped the sop, and gave it to the traitor-apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26</a>). The Lord reclined, probably, at the middle table; St. John next to him; St. Peter most likely on the other side; and the others reclining in an order corresponding more or less closely with the threefold division of the twelve into groups of four.
