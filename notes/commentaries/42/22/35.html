Or rather, these commands to arm themselves against dangers, are to be considered merely as predictions and warnings given them of the dangers and trials they were to meet with. For the predictions of the prophets are often announced under the form of commands. Thus Isaiah, foretelling the destruction of the family of the king of Babylon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-21.htm" title="Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.">Isaiah 14:21</a>, says, <span class="ital">Prepare slaughter for his children, </span>&c. And Jeremiah, foretelling in like manner the destruction of the Jews, exhibits God as thus addressing them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/9-17.htm" title="Thus said the LORD of hosts, Consider you, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that they may come:...">Jeremiah 9:17-18</a>, <span class="ital">Call for the mourning women, </span>&c.

In the way to eternal happiness, we must expect to be assaulted and sifted by Satan. If he cannot destroy, he will try to disgrace or distress us. Nothing more certainly forebodes a fall, in a professed follower of Christ, than self-confidence, with disregard to warnings, and contempt of danger. Unless we watch and pray always, we may be drawn in the course of the day into those sins which we were in the morning most resolved against. If believers were left to themselves, they would fall; but they are kept by the power of God, and the prayer of Christ. Our Lord gave notice of a very great change of circumstances now approaching. The disciples must not expect that their friends would be kind to them as they had been. Therefore, he that has a purse, let him take it, for he may need it. They must now expect that their enemies would be more fierce than they had been, and they would need weapons. At the time the apostles understood Christ to mean real weapons, but he spake only of the weapons of the spiritual warfare. The sword of the Spirit is the sword with which the disciples of Christ must furnish themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When I sent you ... - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-9.htm">Matthew 10:9-10</a>.<p>Lacked ye ... - Did you want anything?

Our Saviour doth doubtless speak in a figure, and all that he intends amounts but to this: Hitherto I have been with you, and you have had my special protection; though you went out without a purse or a scrip, yet you have wanted nothing; though you went without a sword, yet none did you any harm.

But the utterance itself is in respect of its contents so remarkably significant, that we are bound to hold by its originality, and not to say that it was introduced into this place for the sake of explaining the subsequent stroke with the sword (Schleiermacher, Strauss, de Wette), or the reason why Judas is afterwards represented as appearing with armed men (Holtzmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς</span>] A pause must be supposed as occurring before what follows, the <span class="ital">connection of the thought</span> being: not without reason have I uttered words so momentous (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/22-31.htm" title="And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:...">Luke 22:31-34</a>), for now your position, when I am no more with you, will be entirely different from what it was formerly; there comes for you the time of care for yourselves and of contest!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτε ἀπέστειλα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-3.htm" title="And he said to them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor money, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.">Luke 9:3</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-4.htm" title="Carry neither purse, nor money, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.">Luke 10:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-36.htm" title="Then said he to them, But now, he that has a purse, let him take it, and likewise his money: and he that has no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.">Luke 22:36</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>] in consequence of this acknowledgment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀράτω</span>] not: “tollat, ut emat gladium” (Erasmus, Beza, and others), but: <span class="ital">let him take it up</span>, in order to bear it. The representation of the thought now refers to the time when ye can no more be unconcerned about your maintenance, but must yourselves care for it in the world which for you is inhospitable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ μὴ ἔχων</span>] to wit, <span class="greekheb">βαλλάντιον καὶ πήραν</span>. The contrast allows nothing else. Hence <span class="greekheb">μάχαιραν</span> is erroneously suggested as implied (Beza, Jansen, Paulus, Baumgarten-Crusius, Lange, Ewald, Bleek, and others), and equally erroneously is the general reference suggested: <span class="ital">he who is without means</span> (Kuinoel, Olshausen, Schegg). Jesus means to say, how far more necessary still than purse and scrip, nay, even more necessary than the upper garment, should now be to them a <span class="ital">sword</span>, for defence and protection against hostile attacks. But observe in this connection (1) that he wishes for the purchase of the sword, not by those <span class="ital">merely</span> who have no purse and knapsack, but, on the contrary, whilst he requires it of these, yea, requires it with the sacrifice of the cloak, otherwise so needful, yet he regards it as a self-evident duty on the part of those who have the means for the purchase. The form of his utterance is a parallelism, in which the second member supplements and throws a new light upon the first. (2) Nevertheless Jesus does not desire that His disciples should actually carry and use the sword (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-52.htm" title="Then said Jesus to him, Put up again your sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.">Matthew 26:52</a>), but He speaks in such a manner as <span class="ital">figuratively to represent</span> in what a hostile relation they should henceforth find the world arrayed against them, and what resistance and struggle on their part would now be necessary in their apostolic missionary journeys. That the discourse is in reference to these is clearly proved by <span class="greekheb">βαλλάντ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">πήραν</span>, in opposition to Olshausen, who perversely allegorizes the whole passage, so that <span class="greekheb">βαλλάντ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">πήρ</span>. are taken to signify the means for the <span class="ital">spiritual</span> life, and <span class="greekheb">μαχ</span>. sword of the <span class="ital">Spirit</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm" title="And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:">Ephesians 6:17</a> (comp. also Erasmus).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-37.htm" title="For I say to you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.">Luke 22:37</a>.

More than your two swords ye need not! Comp. Castalio on the passage.

In that period, generally speaking, they had been welcomed and kindly entertained by the people, sometimes, they would remember, even with enthusiasm. But they must prepare now for a different life - cold looks, opposition, even bitter persecution, would be their lot for the future. They must order themselves now to meet these things. No ordinary prudent forethought must be omitted by them. He had more than hinted that this future lay before them in his words, "Behold I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves;" now he plainly tells them what kind of life awaited them in the immediate future. Of course, the advice as to the sword was not meant to be taken literally. It was one of those metaphors the Lord used so often in his teaching. For a similar metaphor still more elaborately developed, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>, and following verses. </body></html>
