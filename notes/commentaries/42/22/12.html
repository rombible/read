Those who go upon Christ's word, need not fear disappointment. According to the orders given them, the disciples got all ready for the passover. Jesus bids this passover welcome. He desired it, though he knew his sufferings would follow, because it was in order to his Father's glory and man's redemption. He takes his leave of all passovers, signifying thereby his doing away all the ordinances of the ceremonial law, of which the passover was one of the earliest and chief. That type was laid aside, because now in the kingdom of God the substance was come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-17.htm">Matthew 26:17-19</a> notes, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-12.htm">Mark 14:12-16</a> notes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-13. when ye are entered the city&#8212;He Himself probably stayed at Bethany during the day.<p>there shall a man, &c.&#8212;(See on [1720]Lu 19:29-32).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-3.htm" title="Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.">Luke 22:3</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he shall show you a large upper room furnished,....

That it perhaps belonged to St. Mark's family has also been suggested. It had evidently been prepared beforehand for the purpose of the feast, in obedience to a previous direction of Jesus. "Furnished" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>,) applies specially to carpets spread over the couches for the reception of guests. "In this large upper chamber thus prepared," said the Lord, "make the necessary arrangements for the Paschal Supper; procuring and preparing the lamb, the unleavened bread, the herbs, and other customary dishes." It seems probable that this" large upper room," evidently belonging to a disciple, or at least to one friendly to Jesus, was the same room which, in the happier hours <span class="accented">after</span> the Resurrection, witnessed the appearance of the Risen to the eleven, and, later, the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/22.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>And he (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-15.htm">Mark 14:15</a>.<p>Furnished<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-15.htm">Mark 14:15</a>.
