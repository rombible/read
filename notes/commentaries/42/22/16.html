Here the word “fulfilled” presents a new depth of meaning. The “Passover” was fulfilled in the kingdom of God: (1) in the sacrifice on the cross; (2) in every commemoration of that sacrifice by the acts which He appointed. Every such act was one of Communion, not only of the disciples with each other, but with Him, and in it He is, as it were, joining in the feast with them. Hereafter, as in the promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm" title="Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.">Revelation 3:20</a>, “I will sup with him, and he with Me,” there will be a yet fuller consummation.

Those who go upon Christ's word, need not fear disappointment. According to the orders given them, the disciples got all ready for the passover. Jesus bids this passover welcome. He desired it, though he knew his sufferings would follow, because it was in order to his Father's glory and man's redemption. He takes his leave of all passovers, signifying thereby his doing away all the ordinances of the ceremonial law, of which the passover was one of the earliest and chief. That type was laid aside, because now in the kingdom of God the substance was come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Until it be fulfilled - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

He would, by some significant action and word, show that the great Jewish feast, for so many centuries the central act of the ritual observances under the Mosaic Law, from henceforth would be superseded by a new and a yet more solemn religious rite. The Jewish Passover was to give place to the Christian sacrament. He, their Master, would with them share in the Passover meal that evening for the last time. The next time that he would partake would be still with them, but it would be in the kingdom of God, that is to say, in the Church of God, which was to be founded after his resurrection. The kingdom of God commenced with the resurrection of Jesus. The constant celebration of the Holy Eucharist commenced from that time; it is more than probable that our Lord partook of it, after his resurrection, with his own (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will not any more eat thereof, until... I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until</span>, etc. These statements, which speak of a final partaking (eating and drinking), are closely parallel to the command contained in vers. 19, 20. The first statement seems solemnly to close the celebration of the Passover Feast; the second, to institute with equal solemnity a new feast in its place - With <span class="accented">desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer</span> (ver. 15); for - <span class="accented">The Passover Feast is solemnly put an end to.</span> I will not any more <span class="accented">eat</span> thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God (ver. 16). I will not <span class="accented">drink</span> of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come (ver. 18). <span class="accented">The Holy Eucharist is solemnly instituted.</span> He took <span class="accented">bread</span>,...  and brake it, and gave unto them: ...  This do in remembrance of me (ver. 19). Likewise also the cup after Supper (ver. 20). It was in the course of the great ritual Supper on some of the occasions when the cup was passed round, and the unleavened bread formally broken or dipped in one of the Passover dishes, that the Lord found his opportunity solemnly to announce the formal abrogation of the old Paschal Supper and the institution of the new communion feast. The above <span class="accented">literal</span> interpretation of the Lord's mystic words, "until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>), or, as St. Luke reports them, "I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come " - which literal interpretation in the main is that preferred by Dean Mansel (Commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>); see, too, St. Chrysostom in Matthew Hom. 72, who adopts the same literal interpretation - does not exclude a yet deeper and more spiritual meaning which lies beneath the surface, and which speaks of another and spiritual banquet in the heavenly realm, which not only the Redeemer, but also his redeemed, will partake cf. Heaven-life under the form of a banquet was imagery well known and often painted by the Jewish masters in the old rabbinic schools before and contemporary with the earthly life of Christ. The New Testament writers in several places have adopted the similar imagery, notably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>. How widespread and well loved was this Jewish representation of the heaven-life under the form of a banquet is clear from the three above-quoted references taken from SS. Matthew, Paul (Luke), and John. </body></html>
