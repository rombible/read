In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-6.htm" title="And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.">Acts 5:6</a>, “the young men” appear as a distinct body in the society of disciples, with functions like those of the later deacons or sextons; and the same sense is, perhaps, traceable in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-1.htm" title="Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brothers;">1Timothy 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-6.htm" title="Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.">Titus 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yes, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.">1Peter 5:5</a>.<p><span class= "bld">He that is chief.</span>—Here again the Greek word came to have a half-technical sense as equivalent, or nearly so, to bishop or presbyter. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm" title="Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.">Hebrews 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-17.htm" title="Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.">Hebrews 13:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-24.htm" title="Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.">Hebrews 13:24</a>, where it is rendered “they that have the rule over you.”<p><span class= "bld">He that doth serve.</span>—The verb is the same as that from which the word “deacon” is derived, and, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-11.htm" title="But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.">Matthew 23:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-43.htm" title="But so shall it not be among you: but whoever will be great among you, shall be your minister:">Mark 10:43</a>, probably suggested the ecclesiastical use of the word. It is noticeable that the first recorded example of that use is in the salutation to “the bishops and deacons” of Philippi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Philippians 1:1</a>), the Church which more than any other was under St. Luke’s influence.

In the way to eternal happiness, we must expect to be assaulted and sifted by Satan. If he cannot destroy, he will try to disgrace or distress us. Nothing more certainly forebodes a fall, in a professed follower of Christ, than self-confidence, with disregard to warnings, and contempt of danger. Unless we watch and pray always, we may be drawn in the course of the day into those sins which we were in the morning most resolved against. If believers were left to themselves, they would fall; but they are kept by the power of God, and the prayer of Christ. Our Lord gave notice of a very great change of circumstances now approaching. The disciples must not expect that their friends would be kind to them as they had been. Therefore, he that has a purse, let him take it, for he may need it. They must now expect that their enemies would be more fierce than they had been, and they would need weapons. At the time the apostles understood Christ to mean real weapons, but he spake only of the weapons of the spiritual warfare. The sword of the Spirit is the sword with which the disciples of Christ must furnish themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But ye shall not be so - Christ here takes occasion to explain the nature of his kingdom. He assures them that it is established on different principles from those of the world; that his subjects were not to expect titles, and power, and offices of pomp in his kingdom. He that would be most advanced in "his" kingdom would be he that was most humble; and in order to show them this, he took a towel and girded himself after the manner of a servant, and washed their feet, to show them what ought to be their feelings toward each other. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4-17</a>.<p>He that sitteth at meat - The master of the feast, or one of his guests.<p>But I am among you ... - This was said in connection with his washing their feet. He "showed" them how they ought to feel and act toward each other. "They" ought, therefore, not to aim at office and power, but to be humble, and serve and aid one another. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.
