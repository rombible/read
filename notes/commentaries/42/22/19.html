The other two reports give “He blessed,” instead of “He gave thanks.” There is, of course, no real difference between them. Thanksgiving and blessing both entered into what we may call the Jewish “Grace,” and were so far convertible terms. It is noticeable that St. Paul’s account, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:">1Corinthians 11:23</a>, agrees on this point with St. Luke’s.<p><span class= "bld">Which is given for you.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">which is now in the act of being given.</span> The sacrifice was already inchoate in will. St. Paul’s report omits the participle.<p><span class= "bld">This do in remembrance of me.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">as My memorial,</span> or, <span class= "ital">as your memorial of Me.</span> The words are common to St. Luke and St. Paul, but are not found in the other two reports. The word for “remembrance” occurs, in the New Testament, only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-3.htm" title="But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year.">Hebrews 10:3</a>. In the Greek version of the Old Testament it is applied to the shew-bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-7.htm" title="And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to the LORD.">Leviticus 24:7</a>), to the blowing of trumpets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-10.htm" title="Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.">Numbers 10:10</a>), in the titles of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-1.htm" title="O lord, rebuke me not in your wrath: neither chasten me in your hot displeasure.">Psalm 38:1</a> (“to bring to remembrance,”) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/70-1.htm" title="MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O LORD.">Psalm 70:1</a>. The word had thus acquired the associations connected with a religious memorial, and might be applied to a sacrifice as commemorative, though it did not in itself involve the idea of sacrificing. The fact that our Lord and His disciples had been eating of a sacrifice which was also a memorial, gives a special force to the words thus used. In time to come, they were to remember Him as having given Himself, sacrificed Himself, for them, and this was to be the memorial in which memory was to express itself, and by which it was to be quickened. It may be noted that the early Liturgies, as a rule, follow St. Luke’s report, attaching the word “memorial” sometimes to the bread, sometimes to the cup, sometimes to both.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/22-19.htm" title="And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me....">Luke 22:19-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he took bread </span>— Namely, some time after, when the supper was ended, wherein they had eaten the paschal lamb. <span class="ital">And gave thanks, and brake it </span>— Matthew and Mark say, <span class="ital">Blessed and brake it. </span>They do not say, <span class="ital">Blessed it: </span>for the word <span class="ital">it, </span>though supplied in our translation in Matthew, is not in the original: for which reason, and because Luke here uses the word <span class="greekheb">ευχαριστησας</span>, <span class="ital">he gave thanks, </span>many are of opinion that the word <span class="ital">God </span>should be supplied in Matthew; <span class="ital">he blessed God. And gave unto them, saying, This is my body </span>— That is, the representation of my body, to be broken on the cross. See the like form of expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/41-26.htm" title="The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one....">Genesis 41:26-27</a>. As our Lord had just now celebrated the paschal supper, which was called the passover, so, in the like figurative language, he calls this bread his body. And this circumstance of itself was sufficient to prevent any such mistake, as that this bread was his real body, any more than the paschal lamb was really the passover. <span class="ital">This do in remembrance of me </span>— The passover solemnity was usually concluded with eating a little bread and drinking a cup of wine. Jesus, therefore, when he instituted the Lord’s supper, did not appoint any new rite, but appropriated an old one to a new purpose. Hence the propriety of the expression, <span class="ital">This do in remembrance of me. </span>Do it no longer in remembrance of the deliverance from Egypt, but in remembrance of me, who, by dying for you, will bring you out of spiritual bondage, a bondage far worse than the Egyptian, under which your fathers groaned, and will establish you in the glorious liberty of God’s children: do it in remembrance of me, who, by laying down my life, will ransom you from sin, and death, and hell; and will set open the gates of heaven to you, that you may enter immortality and triumph. <span class="ital">Likewise also the cup after supper </span>— This the Jews termed <span class="ital">the cup of thanksgiving, </span>it being the cup usually given by the master of the family to each after supper: and Matthew says, <span class="ital">Jesus took this, and gave thanks. </span>For, at the institution of the sacrament, he not only gave thanks before he brake and distributed the bread, but before he delivered the cup, to show how infinitely we are obliged to God for our spiritual food, the flesh and blood of his Son, which nourishes the divine life in the soul. <span class="ital">Saying, This cup is the new testament, </span>or <span class="ital">covenant, </span>(as the word <span class="greekheb">διαθηκη </span>rather means,) <span class="ital">in my blood — </span>Here is an undeniable figure, whereby the cup is put for the wine in the cup. And this is called, <span class="ital">the new covenant </span>in Christ’s blood, which could not possibly mean that it was the new covenant itself, but only the seal of it, and the sign of that blood, which was shed to confirm it. In other words, as the expression, <span class="ital">this is my body, </span>signifies, This is the representation of my body; so, <span class="ital">this is my blood of the new covenant, </span>must signify, This is the representation of my blood. And Christ’s meaning in the passage is: All of you, and all my disciples in all ages, must drink of this cup, because it represents my blood, shed for the remission of men’s sins; my blood, in which the new covenant between God and man is ratified; so that this institution exhibits to your joyful meditation the grand foundation of men’s hopes, and perpetuates the memory of the same to the end of the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We here see, then, that it is a primary end of this solemn service, to bring to the devout remembrance of Christians the death of their Master, as the foundation of the remission of their sins; and, in short, the whole mercy of the new covenant, as founded on the shedding of his blood. Therefore, they err who make the keeping up of the memory of Christ’s death in the world, as a simple fact, the only end of the Lord’s supper. We may observe, further, that “from our Lord’s words, here recorded, and from those wherewith the apostle has concluded his account of the Lord’s supper, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-26.htm" title="For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come.">1 Corinthians 11:26</a>, <span class="ital">As often as ye eat this bread, &c., ye do show </span>(<span class="greekheb">καταγγελλετε</span>, <span class="ital">ye preach, ye declare</span>) <span class="ital">the Lord’s death till he come, </span>it appears this sacrament was instituted, not only to bring Christ’s sufferings, and the consequence thereof, to the remembrance of his disciples, but to demonstrate the truth of these things to the world, in all ages. In this view, the Lord’s supper is the strongest proof of his integrity, and of the truth of his mission; for if he had been an impostor, and was to have suffered death on account of his deluding the people, is it to be imagined that he would have instituted any rite with a view to preserve the memory of his having suffered punishment for the worst of crimes? No: this is beyond all human belief. And therefore, since by this institution he has perpetuated the memory of his own sufferings, it is a strong presumption that he was conscious of his own innocence, that his character was really what the evangelists have represented it to be, and that our faith in him, as the Son of God, is well founded.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:19,20 The Lord's supper is a sign or memorial of Christ already come, who by dying delivered us; his death is in special manner set before us in that ordinance, by which we are reminded of it. The breaking of Christ's body as a sacrifice for us, is therein brought to our remembrance by the breaking of bread. Nothing can be more nourishing and satisfying to the soul, than the doctrine of Christ's making atonement for sin, and the assurance of an interest in that atonement. Therefore we do this in rememberance of what He did for us, when he died for us; and for a memorial of what we do, in joining ourselves to him in an everlasting covenant. The shedding of Christ's blood, by which the atonement was made, is represented by the wine in the cup.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26-28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. took the cup&#8212;the first of several partaken of in this service.<p>divide it among, &c.&#8212;that is, It is to be your last as well as Mine, "until the Kingdom of God come," or as it is beautifully given in Mt 26:29, "until that day when I shall drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."

So also even Ebrard (<span class="ital">d. Dogma vom heil. Abendm</span>. I. p. 113), who, besides, lays an emphasis upon <span class="greekheb">μου</span> not belonging to it, at least according to the expression of Luke, when he interprets the passage: “the <span class="ital">new</span> covenant made in <span class="ital">my</span> blood, not in the sacrificial blood of the Old Testament.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ καινὴ διαθήκη</span>] opposed to the old Mosaic covenant, whose condition was the fulfilling of the law (in the new: faith).

The abnormal use of the case is occasioned by the fact that, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-19.htm" title="And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.">Luke 22:19</a>, the idea prevails: that the cup (in respect of its contents) is the blood of the new covenant which is shed. Consequently <span class="greekheb">τὸ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐκχυνόμενον</span> is applied to <span class="greekheb">τῷ αἵματί μου</span> because <span class="greekheb">τὸ αἷμά μου</span> has floated before the mind of the speaker as the <span class="ital">logical</span> predicate, even although it did not become the grammatical predicate. Thus the nominatival expression more emphatically brings into prominence what is declared of the blood (<span class="greekheb">τὸ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐκχυν</span>.) than would be the case if it were joined on in the dative.

Luke agrees the most closely with Paul, which is explained by his relation to him. The Pauline narrative, however, attains great weight, indeed, through his <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ γὰρ παρέλαβον ἀπὸ τοῦ κυρίου</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:">1 Corinthians 11:23</a> (see on the passage), and the ministry of the apostle makes it conceivable how <span class="ital">his</span> formula might fix itself liturgically; this, however, does not prevent our recovering the most primitive form of the words of Jesus in the simple narrative of Mark, which gradually underwent expansions. Wilke, <span class="ital">Urevang</span>. p. 142, is wrong in regarding <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-20.htm" title="Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.">Luke 22:20</a> in Luke as a later addition.

According to Ewald (see his <span class="ital">Jahrb</span>. II. p. 194 f.), the agreement between Luke and Paul is explained by the fact that both have in this particular used one source (the oldest Gospel, probably composed by Philip the evangelist). But in general there is no proof of Paul’s having made use of a written Gospel; neither in particular is the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ γὰρ παρέλαβον ἀπὸ τοῦ κυρίου</span>, in any way favourable to that supposition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/22.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/22-19.htm" title="And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me....">Luke 22:19-20</a>. <span class="ital">The Supper</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">he took bread</span>] The account in St Luke closely agrees with that given by St Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:...">1 Corinthians 11:23-26</a>), which he ‘received from the Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">This is my body</span>] Comp. “I am the door,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-7.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.">John 10:7</a>. “That rock <span class="ital">was</span> Christ,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm" title="And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>. “The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?

All the fierce theological debates between Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Zuinglians, Calvinists, &c. might have been avoided if men had borne in mind the warning of Jesus, “It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in remembrance of me</span>] The emphasis is on the latter words.

Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you</span>. Around these words, and the parallel passages in SS. Matthew and Mark, for more than a thousand years fierce theological disputes have raged. Men have gone gladly to prison and to death rather than renounce what they believed to be the true interpretation. Now, a brief exegetical commentary is not the place to enter into these sad controversies. It will be sufficient here to indicate some of the lines of thought which the prayerful earnest reader might wisely follow out so as to attain certain just ideas respecting the blessed rite here instituted - ideas which may suffice for a practical  religious life. Now, we possess a Divine commentary on this sacrament instituted by our Lord. It is noticeable that St. John, whose Gospel was the latest or well-nigh the latest of the canonical writings of the New Testament, when at great length he relates the story of the last Passover evening and its teaching, does not allude to the institution of that famous service, which, when he wrote his Gospel, had become part of the settled experience of Church life. He <span class="accented">presupposes</span> it; for it had passed then into the ordinary life of the Church. In another and earlier portion of his Gospel, however, St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32-58</a>) gives us a record of the Lord's discourse in the synagogue of Capernaum, in which Jesus, while speaking plainly to those who heard him at the time, gave by anticipation a commentary on the sacrament which he afterwards instituted. The truth which was taught in thin discourse is presented in a specific act and in a concrete form in the Holy Communion. In the fifty-third verse of that sixth chapter we read, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you." How is this now to be done? We reply that our Lord has clothed these ideas and brought them near to us in this sacrament; while, by his teaching in the sixth chapter of St. John, he guards this sacrament from being regarded on the one hand as an end in itself, or on the other as a mere symbol. Certain truths, great <span class="accented">landmarks</span> laid down in this discourse, have to be borne in mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The separation of the flesh of the Son of man into flesh and blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-53.htm">John 6:53</a>) presupposes a violent death submitted to for the sake of others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-51.htm">John 6:51</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Both these elements, the flesh and the blood, are to be appropriated individually by the believer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-56.htm">John 6:56</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> How appropriated? St. Bernard well answers the question which he asks: "What is it to eat his flesh and to drink his blood, but to <span class="accented">share in his sufferings and to imitate the life he lived when with us in the flesh?"</span> (St. Bernard, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>). "If ye suffer with him, ye shall also reign with him." The Holy Eucharist is from one point of view a great truth dramatized, instituted for the purpose of bringing before men in a vivid manner the great truths above alluded to. <span class="accented">But it is something more.</span> It brings to the believer, to the faithful communicant, to the one who in humble adoring faith carries out to the best of his ability his Master's dying charge - it brings a blessing too great for us to measure by earthly language, too deep for us to fathom with human inquiry. For the partaking of this Holy Communion is, first, the Christian's solemn public confession of his faith in Christ crucified; his solemn private declaration that it is his deliberate wish to suffer with his Lord and for his Lord's sake; that it is, too, his firm purpose to imitate the earthly life lived by his Lord. The partaking of this Holy Communion, too, is the Christian's most solemn prayer for strength thus to suffer and to live. It is, too, his fervent expression of belief that this strength will be surely given to him. Further, the partaking of this Holy Communion is, above all, the Christian's most solemn prayer for living union with Christ - "that Christ may dwell in his heart by faith." It is, too, his fervent expression of belief that "then we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us; we are one with. Christ, and Christ with us." This confession, declaration, and prayer he constantly renews in obedience to the dying command of his Master. It is difficult to understand how any belief in a physical change in the elements of bread and wine, such as is involved in the theory of transubstantiation held in the Roman Church, or of consubstantiation in the Lutheran community, can be supposed to enhance the reverence of the communicant, or to augment the blessing promised. The words of the Lord, "This is my body...  my blood," cannot surely be pressed, seeing that the same Divine Speaker was in his discourses in the habit of using imagery which could not literally be pressed, such as "I am the Bread of life," "I am the Door of the sheep," "I am the true Vine," etc. Nothing that can be conceived is more solemn than the simple rite, more awful in its grandeur, more Divine and far-reaching in its promises to the faithful believer. Human imaginings add nothing to this Divine mystery, which is connected at once with the Incarnation and the Atonement. They only serve to envelop it in a shroud of earth-born mist and cloud, and thus to dim if not to veil its Divine glory. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/22.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Bread (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Better, a loaf. </body></html>
