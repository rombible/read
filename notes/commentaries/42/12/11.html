What had been a special promise to the Twelve is now extended to all whom the Lord calls His friends. Note, as characteristic of St. Luke’s phraseology, the combination “magistrates” (better, <span class= "ital">principalities,</span> or <span class= "ital">authorities</span>) and “powers,” the same combination of the two words meeting us again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-20.htm" title="And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.">Luke 20:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-1.htm" title="Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,">Titus 3:1</a>.

Providence takes notice of the meanest creatures, even of the sparrows, and therefore of the smallest interests of the disciples of Christ. Those who confess Christ now, shall be owned by him in the great day, before the angels of God. To deter us from denying Christ, and deserting his truths and ways, we are here assured that those who deny Christ, though they may thus save life itself, and though they may gain a kingdom by it, will be great losers at last; for Christ will not know them, will not own them, nor show them favour. But let no trembling, penitent backslider doubt of obtaining forgiveness. This is far different from the determined enmity that is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall never be forgiven, because it will never be repented of.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17-20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

The best example of this supernatural aid to the accused followers of Jesus which we possess is the grave and stately apology of Stephen before the Sanhedrin. Peter's speech before the same tribunal, and Paul's before Felix and Festus, are also fair instances. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Answer (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>. </body></html>
