Providence takes notice of the meanest creatures, even of the sparrows, and therefore of the smallest interests of the disciples of Christ. Those who confess Christ now, shall be owned by him in the great day, before the angels of God. To deter us from denying Christ, and deserting his truths and ways, we are here assured that those who deny Christ, though they may thus save life itself, and though they may gain a kingdom by it, will be great losers at last; for Christ will not know them, will not own them, nor show them favour. But let no trembling, penitent backslider doubt of obtaining forgiveness. This is far different from the determined enmity that is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall never be forgiven, because it will never be repented of.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

Here it is a word of encouragement to disciples (apostles) to this effect: blaspheming the Holy Spirit <span class="ital">speaking through you</span> will be in God’s sight an unpardonable sin, far more heinous than that of prejudiced Pharisees speaking evil against me, the Son of Man, now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">it shall be forgiven him</span>] Thus our Lord prayed even for His murderers.

The latter sin is expressly declared to be closely connected with the attributing of Christ’s miracles to Beelzebub On the exact nature of the ‘unpardonable sin’ theologians have speculated in vain, and all that we can see is that it must be the most flagrant degree of sin against the fullest light and knowledge.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">it shall not be forgiven</span>] St Matthew adds “neither in this age (or ‘this dispensation’), nor in the age to come (the ‘future dispensation,’ i.e. the dispensation of the Messianic kingdom).” The two terms ‘this aeon’ and ‘the future aeon’ are of <span class="ital">constant</span> occurrence in Rabbinic literature. The passage—if it means more than ‘in either dispensation’— proves, as St Augustine says, that some would be forgiven if not in this life yet in the next <span class="ital">(De Civ.

And yet even <span class="accented">that</span> offense,  which consisted in playing the renegade and the coward; which refused to suffer for him here; which, out of slavish fear of man, consented to abandon his pure and righteous cause; - <span class="accented">that</span> offense, which would be proclaimed before the angels of heaven, would in the end find forgiveness. Some commentators point, as an illustration of this, to the fact of the dying Lord praying on the cross for his murderers; but the offense alluded to here, which should in the end be blotted out, was of far deeper dye. He prayed on his cross for those Romans who sinned, but sinned in the face of little light. But this forgiveness was to be extended to men who, through fear of men and love of the world, should deny him whom they knew to be their Redeemer. This is one of the most hopeful passages which treats of sin eventually to be forgiven, in the whole New Testament. But even here there is no so-called universal redemption announced, for in the next sentence the Lord goes on to speak of a sin which he emphatically said shall <span class="accented">never</span> have forgiveness. <span class="cmt_word">But unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven</span>. What is <span class="accented">this</span> awful sin? We have only to speak of its connection in this place. Here there is no possibility of mistake; it was that determined hatred of holiness, that awful love of self, which had induced the Pharisee leaders to ascribe his beneficent and loving works to the spirit of evil and of darkness. The accusation was no chance one, the fruit of impulse or of passion. They who accused him knew better. They had beard him teach, not once, but often; they had seen his works; and yet, though they knew that the whole life and thoughts and aspirations were true, who were conscious that every word and work was holy, just, and pure, in order to compass their own selfish ends, simply because they felt his life and teaching would interfere with them, <span class="accented">they dared to ascribe to the devil what their own hearts told them came direct from God.</span> This sin, now as then, the merciful Savior tells us <span class="accented">has no forgiveness.</span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A word (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Distinguished from blaspheme, which follows. A word against the poor and humble Son of Man might, as Godet observes, have proceeded from a sincerely pious Jew, under the influence of his early education, which taught him to regard Jesus as an enthusiast or even as an impostor. The sin of the Jews was in rejecting and resisting the power of the Spirit of Pentecost. Pardon was offered them there for the sin of crucifying the Lord (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38-40</a>, and compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-17.htm">Acts 3:17-19</a>). </body></html>
