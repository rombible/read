Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:">Matthew 6:28-33</a>. There are, however, some noticeable variations, as (1) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-27.htm" title="Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say to you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.">Luke 12:27</a>, in the better MSS., <span class= "ital">they spin not, they weave not;</span> (2) the use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-29.htm" title="And seek not you what you shall eat, or what you shall drink, neither be you of doubtful mind.">Luke 12:29</a> of a new verb, “Neither be ye of doubtful mind.” The word is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, and is so far characteristic of St. Luke’s special culture. But its etymology and its classical use make it equivalent to “Be not tossed to and fro like a ship out on the open sea;” and so taken, it presents a parallel to St. James’s description of the “man that wavereth,” as “like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-6.htm" title="But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.">James 1:6</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:22-40 Christ largely insisted upon this caution not to give way to disquieting, perplexing cares, Mt 6:25-34. The arguments here used are for our encouragement to cast our care upon God, which is the right way to get ease. As in our stature, so in our state, it is our wisdom to take it as it is. An eager, anxious pursuit of the things of this world, even necessary things, ill becomes the disciples of Christ. Fears must not prevail; when we frighten ourselves with thoughts of evil to come, and put ourselves upon needless cares how to avoid it. If we value the beauty of holiness, we shall not crave the luxuries of life. Let us then examine whether we belong to this little flock. Christ is our Master, and we are his servants; not only working servants, but waiting servants. We must be as men that wait for their lord, that sit up while he stays out late, to be ready to receive him. In this Christ alluded to his own ascension to heaven, his coming to call his people to him by death, and his return to judge the world. We are uncertain as to the time of his coming to us, we should therefore be always ready. If men thus take care of their houses, let us be thus wise for our souls. Be ye therefore ready also; as ready as the good man of the house would be, if he knew at what hour the thief would come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-33</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25, 26. which of you, &c.&#8212;Corroding solicitude will not bring you the least of the things ye fret about, though it may double the evil of wanting them.

Some copies read, "the lilies of the field", as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28</a> The Persic version renders the word, "the roses and lilies of the field": and the Arabic version, the "flowers"; any flowers of the field; for what is afterwards said, is true of any of them, but particularly of the lilies: now, as the former instance of God's feeding the ravens is designed to remove all anxious and distressing thoughts about food for the body; this is mentioned to take off every thing of that kind with respect to clothing for it; wherefore, in Matthew, these words are premised to it, "and why take ye thought for raiment?" there will be no need of it, when it considered how the lilies, or tulips, or any other flowers grow up out of the earth, and in what a fine beautiful dress they appear, without any care or labour of their own, and even without the care and management of a gardener; for flowers of the field are here meant: <p>they toil not, they spin not; they neither labour as men do, in sowing flax, and dressing it, or in combing of wool, or in spinning of either: <p>and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. The Ethiopic version renders it, "in the whole time of his glory"; throughout his glorious reign, at any time; whenever upon any extraordinary occasion he was dressed out in the finest manner, yet even then a lily outdid him; its glory being natural to it, whereas his, at best, was but artificial, and an imitation of nature; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-29.htm">Matthew 6:29</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">the lilies</span>] The term is perfectly general.
