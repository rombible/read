The Greek conjunction cannot possibly have the meaning of “for,” and the latter word suggests a logical connection which is different from that of the original. What our Lord seems to say is, “Beware ye of . . . hypocrisy . . .; but, whether ye beware or not, know that all that is now secret will one day be manifested.” On the verse itself, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm" title="At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.">Matthew 11:25</a>. The connection in the two passages is, however, very different. There the underlying thought of a future day of revelation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1Corinthians 4:5</a>) is made a motive to courage in proclaiming truths that had been received in secret; here as a motive to caution, lest we should be trusting in the counterfeits of truth and holiness. The force of the two Greek words would, perhaps, be better expressed by, <span class= "ital">There is nothing veiled that shall not be unveiled.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/12-2.htm" title="For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known....">Luke 12:2-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">For there is nothing covered, </span>&c. — All your actions shall be brought to light, either in this world or in the next.

This argument against hypocrisy he proceeded to improve as a reason for their acquiring another quality, which would serve all the ends they could propose by their hypocrisy, and to much better purpose; an undaunted resolution in the performance of their duty, founded on faith in God, who now governs the world by a particular providence, and in the end will reward or punish every man according to his deeds. <span class="ital">I say unto you, my friends </span>— With all possible seriousness, and tender concern for your everlasting welfare; <span class="ital">Be not afraid of them that kill the body </span>— Let not the fear of man make you act the hypocrite, or conceal any thing which I have commissioned you to publish: <span class="ital">and after that have no more that they can do </span>— The immortal soul being entirely out of their reach. <span class="ital">But I will forewarn you </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">υποδειξω υμιν</span>, <span class="ital">I will show </span>you; <span class="ital">whom you shall fear </span>— Whose displeasure you shall be afraid to incur; <span class="ital">fear him, which after he hath killed </span>the body, <span class="ital">hath power to cast into hell </span>— Is able to torment the soul eternally, and whose displeasure, therefore, is infinitely to be dreaded. <span class="ital">Yea, I say unto you, Fear him </span>— And rather choose to venture on the greatest dangers, and to sacrifice your lives, than to do any thing which may offend his Divine Majesty.

Providence takes notice of the meanest creatures, even of the sparrows, and therefore of the smallest interests of the disciples of Christ. Those who confess Christ now, shall be owned by him in the great day, before the angels of God. To deter us from denying Christ, and deserting his truths and ways, we are here assured that those who deny Christ, though they may thus save life itself, and though they may gain a kingdom by it, will be great losers at last; for Christ will not know them, will not own them, nor show them favour. But let no trembling, penitent backslider doubt of obtaining forgiveness. This is far different from the determined enmity that is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall never be forgiven, because it will never be repented of.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nothing covered - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-26.htm">Matthew 10:26-32</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. hid&#8212;from knowledge.

Here it is applied as an argument against hypocrisy, or the concealing of naughty and corrupt hearts under the vizor and disguise of demure looks, or fair conversation. In the day of judgment sinners shall walk naked, and men shall see their shame; God will in that day make known all the secrets of men’s hearts, to be sure the secrets of all their hearts, whose iniquities are not forgiven, and whose sins are not covered. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed,....

Publicity which lies open to the world’s judgment, and hypocritical character which must shun disclosure, are irreconcilable. If you would not dread the former, the latter must remain far from you. According to Weiss, Luke has given to the whole saying only the meaning, that everything concealed by hypocrisy nevertheless one day comes to light, and therefore, even every word, however secretly it is spoken, shall come one day to publicity. But this supposition, without any ground for it, attributes to Luke a complete misapprehension of the meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-3.htm" title="Therefore whatever you have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which you have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed on the housetops.">Luke 12:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθʼ ὧν</span>] <span class="ital">quare, wherefore</span>.

In itself the saying is appropriate in both places, nay, it may have been uttered more than once; but in Matthew and Mark we have its closest historical connection and position.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to the <span class="ital">blasphemy against the Holy Spirit</span>, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-31.htm" title="Why I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men.">Matthew 12:31</a> f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[153] According to Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">Evang</span>. p. 192 (comp. his <span class="ital">Zeitschrift</span>, 1865, p. 192), and Köstlin, p. 147, this publicity is regarded as having been meant as a contrast to the <span class="ital">ministry of the Twelve</span>, because they had chiefly limited themselves <span class="ital">to the circle of Judaism</span>. It is not indeed in agreement with this that <span class="ital">that which is secret</span> should so purposely be made prominent.

II. 2, p. 342, insists on regarding the blasphemy against the Spirit in this place as not distinct from the denial of Jesus. He says that this denial, in the case of those, namely, who had not only had the earthly human manifestation of Jesus before them, but had received the Holy Spirit, is blasphemy against the Spirit. But it is very arbitrary to assume, in contradiction to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-31.htm" title="Why I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven to men.">Matthew 12:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-29.htm" title="But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost has never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.">Mark 3:29</a>, that the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit presupposes that the Spirit has already been received. The blasphemers of the Spirit are malevolently conscious and hardened opposers of Christ. They may certainly have already had the Spirit and have apostatized and become such opposers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-29.htm" title="Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?">Hebrews 10:29</a>); but if such people were to be understood in this passage, some clearer indication should have been given.
