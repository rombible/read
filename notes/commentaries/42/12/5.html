Providence takes notice of the meanest creatures, even of the sparrows, and therefore of the smallest interests of the disciples of Christ. Those who confess Christ now, shall be owned by him in the great day, before the angels of God. To deter us from denying Christ, and deserting his truths and ways, we are here assured that those who deny Christ, though they may thus save life itself, and though they may gain a kingdom by it, will be great losers at last; for Christ will not know them, will not own them, nor show them favour. But let no trembling, penitent backslider doubt of obtaining forgiveness. This is far different from the determined enmity that is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall never be forgiven, because it will never be repented of.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall be proclaimed upon the housetops - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>. The custom of making proclamation from the tops or roofs of houses still prevails in the East. Dr. Thomson ("The Land and the Book," vol. i. p. 51, 52) says: "At the present day, local governors in country districts cause their commands thus to be published. Their proclamations are generally made in the evening, after the people have returned from their labors in the field. The public crier ascends the highest roof at hand, and lifts up his voice in a long-drawn call upon all faithful subjects to give ear and obey. He then proceeds to announce, in a set form, the will of their master, and demand obedience thereto." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Fear Him &#8230; Fear Him&#8212;how striking the repetition here! Only the one fear would effectually expel the other.<p>after he hath killed, &c.&#8212;Learn here&#8212;(1) To play false with one's convictions to save one's life, may fail of its end after all, for God can inflict a violent death in some other and equally formidable way. (2) There is a hell, it seems, for the body as well as the soul; consequently, sufferings adapted to the one as well as the other. (3) Fear of hell is a divinely authorized and needed motive of action even to Christ's "friends." (4) As Christ's meekness and gentleness were not compromised by such harsh notes as these, so those servants of Christ lack their Master's spirit who soften down all such language to please ears "polite."

There can, however, be no doubt that the reference is to God. If “fear” ever meant ‘be on your guard against,’ the other view might be tenable, but there is no instance of such a meaning, and we are bidden to defy and resist the Devil, but <span class="ital">never</span> to fear him; nor are we ever told that <span class="ital">he</span> has any power to cast into Gehenna.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to cast into hell</span>] Rather, into Gehenna. It is a deep misfortune that our English Version has made no consistent difference of rendering between ‘the place of the dead,’ ‘the intermediate state between death and resurrection’ <span class="ital">(Hades, Sheol),</span> and Gehenna, which is sometimes metaphorically used (as here) for a place of <span class="ital">punishment</span> after death. Gehenna was a purely Hebrew word, and corresponded primarily to purely Hebrew conceptions. Our Lord (if He spoke Greek) did not attempt to represent it by any analogous, but imperfectly equivalent, Greek term like Tartarus (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm" title="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2 Peter 2:4</a>), and certainly the Apostles and Evangelists did not. They simply <span class="ital">transliterated</span> the Hebrew term (<span class="greekheb">גי הנם</span> Gê Hinnom, Valley of Hinnom) into Greek letters. It is surely a plain positive duty to follow so clear an example, and not to render Gehenna by English terms which <span class="ital">cannot</span> connote <span class="ital">exactly</span> the same conceptions.

Milton describes it with his usual learned accuracy:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“First Moloch, horrid king, besmeared with blood<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of human sacrifice, and parents’ tears;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Though for the noise of drums and timbrels loud<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Their children’s cries unheard that passed through fire<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To his grim idol......<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and made his grove<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The pleasant Valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Par.

King Josiah, to mark his abhorrence of the idol-rites, defiled it with corpses; fires were subsequently kindled to consume the putrefying matter and prevent pestilence. The once fair valley, thus successively defiled with hideous corrupting rites, by putrefying corpses, and then with blazing fires lit to consume what would otherwise have occasioned pestilence, was taken by rabbinical writers as a symbol for the place of torment, and is used not unfrequently as a synonym for "hell." The translators of the Authorized Version have done so here. The reminder is, after all, we need not fear men. When they have done their worst, they have only injured or tortured the perishable body. The One whom all have good reason to fear is God, whose power is not limited to this life, but extends through and beyond death. Some have strangely supposed, not <span class="accented">God</span>, but the <span class="accented">devil</span>, is intended here to be the real object of human fear. The devil can be no object of fear to the Master's disciples. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I will forewarn (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9;)<p>Rev., warn.
