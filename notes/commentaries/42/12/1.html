The dispute that had begun in the Pharisee’s house, and had been carried on by the lawyers and scribes as they followed Jesus from it, attracted notice. As on the occasion of the “unwashed hands” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-10.htm" title="And he called the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand:">Matthew 15:10</a>), He appeals from the scribes to the people, or rather to His own disciples, scattered among the people. The scene may be compared, in the vividness of its description, with the picture of the crowd at Capernaum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/2-1.htm" title="And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.">Mark 2:1-2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees.</span>—This again was obviously an expression that had become almost proverbial in our Lord’s lips (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:6</a>). Here, however, the leaven is more definitely specified as “hypocrisy”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> unreality, the simulation, conscious or unconscious, of a holiness which we do not possess. It does not follow that the Pharisees were deliberate impostors of the Tartuffe type. With them, as with other forms of religionism, it was doubtless true that the worst hypocrisy was that which did not know itself to be hypocritical. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-2.htm" title="Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-1.htm" title="In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, so that they stepped one on another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware you of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.">Luke 12:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">When there were gathered together an innumerable multitude </span>— <span class="greekheb">Επισυναχθεισων των μυριαδων</span>, literally, <span class="ital">myriads </span>(that is, tens of thousands, how many is not said) <span class="ital">being gathered together. </span>By this it appears, that though the scribes and Pharisees thought to accuse him, and bring him into disrepute, the people that were not under the influence of their prejudices and jealousies still admired him, attended on him, and did him honour. Nay, it seems the more these learned hypocrites strove to drive them from Christ, the more they flocked to him; which, doubtless, vexed them no little. It is not improbable, however, that this vast assemblage of people might be partly owing to an apprehension, either that Christ might meet with some ill usage among so many of his enemies, or that he would say or do something peculiarly remarkable on the occasion. Be this as it may, it is evident that the people could bear reproof better than the Pharisees; for though, in the morning, when they were gathered thick together, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-29.htm" title="And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.">Luke 11:29</a>,) he had severely reproved them, as <span class="ital">an evil generation </span>that <span class="ital">sought a sign, </span>yet in the afternoon they renewed their attendance on him. It is pleasing to see people thus forward to hear the word of God, and venture upon inconvenience and danger, rather than miss an opportunity of being instructed in divine things. <span class="ital">He began to say unto his disciples, Beware of the leaven, </span>&c. — The caution given in this and the two following verses, and the subsequent exhortations contained in this paragraph, are to the same purpose with others that we have had in Matthew and Mark, upon other the like occasions. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-26.htm" title="Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known....">Matthew 10:26-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-15.htm" title="And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.">Mark 8:15</a>. For it is reasonable to suppose, that our blessed Lord preached the same doctrines, and pressed the same duties, at several times; and that some of his evangelists have recorded them as he delivered them at one time, and others as he taught them at another. It is here said, that he addressed his disciples <span class="ital">first of all; </span>for they were his peculiar charge, his family, his school, and therefore he particularly warned them as his beloved sons. They made a greater profession of religion than others, and hypocrisy therein was the sin of which they were most in danger. And as they were to preach to others, if they should prevaricate, corrupt the word of God, and deal deceitfully with it, and with the souls of men, their hypocrisy would be more criminal than that of others. Christ’s disciples, Judas excepted, were, we have reason to believe, the best men in the world, and yet we see they needed to be cautioned against hypocrisy. What need, then, have we to be jealous of ourselves lest we should fall into this sin! Christ gave this caution to his disciples in the hearing of this great multitude of people, rather than privately, to add the greater weight to it, and to let the world know that he would not countenance any sin, and especially hypocrisy, even in those he loved best.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-12 A firm belief of the doctrine of God's universal providence, and the extent of it, would satisfy us when in peril, and encourage us to trust God in the way of duty. Providence takes notice of the meanest creatures, even of the sparrows, and therefore of the smallest interests of the disciples of Christ. Those who confess Christ now, shall be owned by him in the great day, before the angels of God. To deter us from denying Christ, and deserting his truths and ways, we are here assured that those who deny Christ, though they may thus save life itself, and though they may gain a kingdom by it, will be great losers at last; for Christ will not know them, will not own them, nor show them favour. But let no trembling, penitent backslider doubt of obtaining forgiveness. This is far different from the determined enmity that is blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall never be forgiven, because it will never be repented of.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the mean time - While he was discoursing with the scribes and Pharisees, as recorded in the last chapter.<p>An innumerable multitude - The original word is "myriad's," or ten thousands. It is used here to signify that there was a great crowd or collection of people, who were anxious to hear him. Multitudes were attracted to the Saviour's ministry, and it is worthy of remark that he never had more to hear him than when he was most faithful and severe in his reproofs of sinners. Men's consciences are on the side of the faithful reprover of their sins; and though they deeply feel the reproof, yet they will still respect and hear him that reproves.<p>To his disciples first of all - This does not mean that his disciples were, before all others, to avoid hypocrisy, but that this was the "first" or chief thing of which they were to beware. The meaning is this: "He said to his disciples, "Above all things beware," etc.<p>The leaven - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6</a>.<p>Which is hypocrisy - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-5.htm">Matthew 7:5</a>. Hypocrisy is like leaven or yeast, because:<p>1. It may exist without being immediately detected. Leaven mixed in flour is not known until it produces its effects.<p>2. It is insinuating. Leaven will soon pervade the whole mass. So hypocrisy will, if undetected and unremoved, soon pervade all our exercises and feelings.<p>3. It is swelling. It puffs us up, and fills us with pride and vanity. No man is more proud than the hypocrite, and none is more odious to God. When Jesus cautions them to beware of "the leaven of the Pharisees," he means that they should be cautious about imbibing their spirit and becoming like them. The religion of Jesus is one of sincerity, of humility, of an entire want of disguise. The humblest man is the best Christian, and he who has the least disguise is most like his Master. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Lu 12:1-12.

But that is not the same caution with this; there he compared their doctrine to leaven, for the aptness of it to infect others; here he compares their lives to the same thing, and for the same reason: this appeareth to be the same sense of our Saviour here, because he saith their leaven is hypocrisy. There are none so like to do mischief to the better sort of people, as those that, under a mask and exterior disguise of severity and strictness, indulge themselves in corrupt affections and vicious inclinations. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In the mean time,.... While Christ was discoursing with the Pharisees, and they were using him in the vilest manner, throwing out their invectives against him in order to draw off the people from him: <p>when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people. There were "myriads" of them, as in the original text, and a myriad is ten thousand; the meaning is, that there were several thousands of them: <p>insomuch that they trod one upon another; striving to get near to Christ, either to see his person, or to hear his discourses; and particularly, what he would say to the Pharisees, who had fallen upon him in so violent a manner: <p>he began to say unto his disciples first of all; he directed his discourse not to the Pharisees, nor to the multitude, but to his disciples in the first place; at least, chiefly to them; for whom he had a regard, who were his dear friends, and were to be the preachers of his Gospel every where; and therefore it was proper that they should be aware of the dissembling arts of the Scribes and Pharisees, and have their minds fortified against approaching dangers, persecutions, and death itself: the last phrase, "first of all", is omitted in the Vulgate Latin version; and by all the Oriental versions, it is joined to the next clause, and read thus, "especially", or <p>before all things, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy; expressed both in their doctrines, and in their lives; which carried a great show of piety and holiness, but was in appearance only: very aptly is hypocrisy in doctrine and manners, compared to leaven; which at first is small and little, but gradually increases and spreads itself, and lies hid and covered, and is not easily discerned, nor its influence and effects observed; but in time, it infects and corrupts the whole of men's principles and practices, and puffs and swells them up with a vain opinion of themselves; and when our Lord bids his disciples beware of it, his meaning not only is, that they take heed that they were not infected with it themselves, but that they were not imposed upon by the specious pretences of these artful and designing men. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> the mean time, when there were gathered together <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</span><p>(1) The faithful teachers of God's word, who are appointed by him for his people, must both take good heed of those who corrupt the purity of doctrine with smooth speech, and also take pains through the help of God to set forth sincere doctrine, openly and without fear.<p>(a) Literally, ten thousand of people, a certain number which is given for an uncertain number.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/luke/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-1.htm" title="In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, so that they stepped one on another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware you of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.">Luke 12:1</a>.

Among the longer discourses in Luke none is so much of a mosaic as the present. Although the historical situation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-1.htm" title="In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, so that they stepped one on another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware you of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.">Luke 12:1</a> is not invented, yet by the designed and plainly exaggerated bringing together of a great multitude of people it is confused.

Yet this immense gathering is not accounted for: it does not appear where or why it collected, but the <span class="greekheb">ἐν οἶς</span> suggests that the people had been drawn together by the encounter between Jesus and His foes.—<span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span> from its position naturally qualifies <span class="greekheb">προσέχετε</span>, implying that hypocrisy was the first topic of discourse (Meyer). But it may also be taken with <span class="greekheb">μαθητὰς</span>, as implying that, while Jesus meant to speak to the crowd, He addressed Himself in the first place to His disciples (Schanz, J. Weiss, Holtzmann). Bornemann points out that while Mt. places <span class="greekheb">τρῶτον</span> after imperatives, Lk. places it also before, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-61.htm" title="And another also said, Lord, I will follow you; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.">Luke 9:61</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-5.htm" title="And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this house.">Luke 10:5</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς ζύμης τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">φ</span>.: this is the <span class="ital">logion</span> reported in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-15.htm" title="And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.">Mark 8:15</a>, connected there with the demand for a sign; here to be viewed in the light of the discourse in the Pharisee’s house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-37.htm" title="And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee sought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.">Luke 11:37</a> f.). In the two first Gospels the warning expresses rather Christ’s sense of the deadly character of the Pharisaic leaven; here it is a didactic utterance for the guidance of disciples as witnesses of the truth.—<span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἐστὶν ὑπόκρισις</span>: not in Mt. and Mk.; might be taken as an explanatory gloss, but probably to be viewed as part of the <span class="ital">logion</span>.

Hypocrisy in the sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-13.htm" title="And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.">Galatians 2:13</a> was the temptation of the apostolic age, when truth could not be spoken and acted without risk.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/12-1.htm" title="In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, so that they stepped one on another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware you of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy....">Luke 12:1-12</a>.

It is evident that the noise of this disgraceful attack on our Lord had been heard. This scene was as it were the watershed of our Lord’s ministry in Galilee. At this period He had excited intense opposition among the religious authorities, but was still beloved and revered by the people. They therefore flocked together for His protection, and their arrival hushed the unseemly and hostile vehemence of the Pharisees.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they trode one upon another</span>] Literally, “<span class="ital">trod one another down.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>he began to say</span>] The words seem to imply a specially solemn and important discourse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto his disciples first of all, Beware</span>] Rather, to His disciples, Beware first of all of, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the leaven of the Pharisees</span>] See for comment <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-12.htm" title="Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-15.htm" title="And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.">Mark 8:15</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-1.htm" title="In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, so that they stepped one on another, he began to say to his disciples first of all, Beware you of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.">Luke 12:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν οἷς</span>) [“in the meantime”] <span class="ital">during these things</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τῶν</span>) of those who were wont to be present.—<span class="greekheb">μυριάδων</span>, <span class="ital">myriads</span>) Not merely the adjective <span class="greekheb">μύριοι</span>, but this substantive <span class="greekheb">μυρίαδες</span>, is wont to be used of a large indefinite number.—<span class="greekheb">πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς</span>, <span class="ital">unto His disciples</span>) The rest were not yet able to comprehend this doctrine.—<span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span>, <span class="ital">first of all</span>) To the disciples first: then, after one or two interruptions and questions, to the multitude of people also: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-54.htm" title="And he said also to the people, When you see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway you say, There comes a shower; and so it is.">Luke 12:54</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπόκρισις</span>, <span class="ital">hypocrisy</span>) This charge is afterwards brought also in the case of the people: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-56.htm" title="You hypocrites, you can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that you do not discern this time?">Luke 12:56</a>. Hypocrisy, like a leaven, infects the whole man, and through the one man infects many. Hypocrisy is either when evil is covered over with a good veil by evil men, or when good is in an evil manner (improperly) covered by good men. This latter kind of hypocrisy is what is denoted in the present instance.

The name of the large village or provincial town where all this happened is unknown. The crowd who had been listening to the great Teacher before he accepted the Pharisee's invitation still lingered around the house. Many from the adjoining villages, hearing that Jesus was in this place and was publicly teaching, had arrived; so, when the Lord came out from the guest-chamber into the street or market-place, he found a vast crowd - literally, myriads of the multitude - waiting for him. The words descriptive of the crowd in ver. I indicate that a vast concourse was gathered together. His fame then was very great, though his popularity was on the wane. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy</span>. In dwelling on this and similar expressions used by our Lord in respect to the life and work of this famous section of the people who were generally so bitterly hostile to him and his teaching, we must not condemn their whole character with a condemnation more sweeping than the Master's. Utterly mistaken in their views of life and in their estimate of God, whom they professed to know, our Lord here scarcely charges them with dell-berate hypocrisy. These mistaken men dreamed that they possessed a holiness which was never theirs; unconscious hypocrites they doubtless were, without possibly even suspecting it themselves. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>An innumerable multitude (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>The word &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; strictly means a number of ten thousand.
