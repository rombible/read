Ask not, How many shall be saved? But, Shall I be one of them? Not, What shall become of such and such? But, What shall I do, and what will become of me? Strive to enter in at the strait gate. This is directed to each of us; it is, Strive ye. All that will be saved, must enter in at the strait gate, must undergo a change of the whole man. Those that would enter in, must strive to enter. Here are awakening considerations, to enforce this exhortation. Oh that we may be all awakened by them! They answer the question, Are there few that shall be saved? But let none despond either as to themselves or others, for there are last who shall be first, and first who shall be last. If we reach heaven, we shall meet many there whom we little thought to meet, and miss many whom we expected to find.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11-12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28, 29.

God has his chosen ones, and Christ has a people in all parts of the world; and therefore his Gospel must be preached to all nations, for the gathering of them in, which will be done in the latter day; and in the resurrection morn, as these will be raised in the several places where they will have been buried, they will come from thence, and make one body, and will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air, and will be for ever with him: <p>and shall sit down in the kingdom of God; in Christ's kingdom, in the new heavens, and new earth, as persons that sit down at a table, to partake of a feast; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-30.htm">Luke 22:30</a> and in the ultimate glory, where they shall have rest, peace, and joy, for evermore. The Ethiopic version renders it, "they shall rejoice in the kingdom of God"; they shall partake of the joys of heaven; everlasting joy shall be upon their heads, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away; and the Persic version, "and they shall take a repose, and sit and rest"; they shall rest from all their labour, and be in perfect ease and peace; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they shall come from the <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> east, and <i>from</i> the west, and from the north, and <i>from</i> the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.</span><p>(g) From all the corners of the world, and the places mentioned here are four of the main ones.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-29.htm" title="And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.">Luke 13:29</a> points to an aggravation of the misery of the outcasts: men coming from every quarter of the globe to join the festive company and finding admission. The shut door and the too late arrival are now out of view, and for the private house of the parable is substituted the Kingdom of God which it represents. It is needless to ask whether Mt. or Lk. has given this saying in its true place.

It distinctly includes in those blessed ranks men from all parts of the far isles of the Gentiles. </body></html>
