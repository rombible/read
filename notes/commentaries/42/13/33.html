The words indicate the intensity of conviction and of purpose as that expressed before. I cannot bring myself to accept the words that follow—“to-day and to-morrow . . .”—as meaning that there were but three days to pass before He should enter Jerusalem. It would not have been true in fact. It would have seemed obvious, had we not too abundant proof of men’s want of power to enter into the poetic forms of Eastern speech when they differ from our own, that the literal meaning here is altogether out of place, and that the same formula is used as in the preceding verse, with the same meaning—i.e., as conveying the thought of a short, undefined interval.<p><span class= "bld">It cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</span>—The word used here for “it cannot be,” occurs in this passage only of the New Testament, and has a peculiar half-ironical force—“It is not meet, it would be at variance with the fitness of things, it is morally impossible.” Jerusalem had made the slaughter of the prophets a special prerogative, a monopoly, as has been said, of which none might rob her.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/13-33.htm" title="Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem....">Luke 13:33-35</a></span>. <span class="ital">Nevertheless, I must walk to-day, </span>&c. — Notwithstanding all that he can do, I shall, for the short time I have left, do the works of Him that sent me, without being afraid of any man; because my life cannot be taken from me till the time come, which is appointed of God. When that period is arrived, I shall be offered up, yet not here, but in the bloody city. <span class="ital">For it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem </span>— That unhappy city, which claims prescription for murdering the messengers of God. Such cruelty and malice cannot be found elsewhere. If a true prophet was put to death, he was prosecuted as a false prophet. Now the supreme court, whose prerogative it was to judge prophets, had its seat at Jerusalem. Inferior courts did not take cognizance of such causes; and therefore, if a prophet was put to death, it must be at Jerusalem. So Dr. Lightfoot here. Our Lord, “in saying a prophet could not perish out of that city, insinuated, that he knew the intentions of the Pharisees too well to pay any regard to their advice respecting departing from Galilee for fear of Herod. Or, in making this observation, his design may have been to display the wickedness of that city, the inhabitants of which had been, in every age, the chief enemies of the messengers of God: and to this agrees what our Lord says of Jerusalem in the pathetic lamentation which he now utters concerning it, on account of its crimes, its obstinacy, and its punishment.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem </span>— Thou guilty and miserable city, <span class="ital">which, </span>though thou hast been distinguished by divine favours beyond any place on earth, yet, with the utmost ingratitude and cruelty, <span class="ital">killest the prophets, and stonest, </span>as the vilest malefactors, <span class="ital">them that are sent unto thee </span>— As the ambassadors of God. <span class="ital">How often would I have gathered thy children — </span>Unto myself, with all the tenderness of paternal love; <span class="ital">as a hen her brood under her wings </span>— To cherish and defend them.

And now, <span class="ital">behold, </span>with awful dread, and mark the prediction and event: <span class="ital">your house is left unto you desolate </span>— Is now irrevocably consigned to desolation and destruction. <span class="ital">For verily I say unto you </span>— I will quickly cease my labours among you, and withdraw from you in such righteous displeasure, that <span class="ital">ye shall not see me until the time come when, </span>taught by your calamities, <span class="ital">ye shall </span>be ready and disposed to <span class="ital">say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord </span>— Wishing in vain for the succour of him whom you now despise.

This does not imply that they should then or ever see Jesus at all; but only that they would earnestly wish for the Messiah, and, in the extremity of their distress, be ready to entertain any one who might offer himself under that character. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/17-22.htm" title="And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it....">Luke 17:22-23</a>. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 Christ, in calling Herod a fox, gave him his true character. The greatest of men were accountable to God, therefore it became him to call this proud king by his own name; but it is not an example for us. I know, said our Lord, that I must die very shortly; when I die, I shall be perfected, I shall have completed my undertaking. It is good for us to look upon the time we have before us as but little, that we may thereby be quickened to do the work of the day in its day. The wickedness of persons and places which more than others profess religion and relation to God, especially displeases and grieves the Lord Jesus. The judgment of the great day will convince unbelievers; but let us learn thankfully to welcome, and to profit by all who come in the name of the Lord, to call us to partake of his great salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I must walk ... - I must remain here this short time.

I am not at all alarmed, therefore, at any threats of "Herod," for my life is safe until I arrive at Jerusalem. Go and tell him, therefore, that I fear him not. I shall work here as long as it is proper, and shall then go up to Jerusalem to die. The reason why he said that a prophet could not perish elsewhere than in Jerusalem might be:<p>1. That he knew that he would be tried on a charge of blasphemy, and no other court could have cognizance of that crime but the great council or Sanhedrin, and so he was not afraid of any threats of Herod.,<p>2. It "had been" the fact that the prophets had been chiefly slain there. The meaning is, "It cannot easily be done elsewhere; it is not usually done.

The occupation of these three days is rather, according to ver. 32, principally the casting out of demons and healings; but the <span class="ital">journey</span> must have been <span class="ital">bound up</span> therewith, so that Jesus intends on the third day to reach the limit to which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.">Luke 17:11</a> He has already come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[170] Schleiermacher is wrong in assuming (<span class="ital">Schr. d.
