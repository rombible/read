The greatest of men were accountable to God, therefore it became him to call this proud king by his own name; but it is not an example for us. I know, said our Lord, that I must die very shortly; when I die, I shall be perfected, I shall have completed my undertaking. It is good for us to look upon the time we have before us as but little, that we may thereby be quickened to do the work of the day in its day. The wickedness of persons and places which more than others profess religion and relation to God, especially displeases and grieves the Lord Jesus. The judgment of the great day will convince unbelievers; but let us learn thankfully to welcome, and to profit by all who come in the name of the Lord, to call us to partake of his great salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37-39</a>.<p>From the message which Jesus sent to Herod we may learn:<p>1. That our lives are safe in the hands of God, and that wicked people can do no more to injure us than he shall permit. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>.<p>2. That we "should" go on fearlessly in doing our duty, and especially if we are doing good. We should not regard the threats of people. God is to be obeyed; and even if obedience should involve us in difficulty and trials, still we should not hesitate to commit our cause to God and go forward.<p>3. We should be on our guard against crafty and unprincipled people. They often "profess" to seek our good when they are only plotting our ruin. Even those professedly coming from our enemies to caution us are often also our enemies, and are secretly plotting our ruin or endeavoring to prevent our doing good.<p>4. We see here the nature of religion. It shrinks at nothing which is duty. It goes forward trusting in God. It comes out boldly and faces the world. And,<p>5. How beautiful and consistent is the example of Christ! How "wise" was he to detect the arts of his foes! how "fearless" in going forward, in spite of all their machinations, to do what God had appointed for him to do! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34, 35.

But in Matthew, after His royal entry, going out from the temple for the last time, He solemnly declared their house to be left <span class="ital">desolate</span>.[140] [We have been permitted to observe the same nice distinction in the words respectively used, between <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-49.htm" title="Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:">Luke 11:49</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-34.htm" title="Why, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall you whip in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:">Matthew 23:34</a> : see the notes on both passages.—<span class="ital">Harm</span>., p. 407.]—<span class="greekheb">λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν</span>, <span class="ital">but I say unto you</span>) He speaks sternly, and yet mercifully, as we have just now remarked.

For that it is not the full and exhaustive fulfilment of it is plain from the fact, that presently <span class="ital">after</span> they had used the words, “Blessed is He,” etc., ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-38.htm" title="Saying, Blessed be the King that comes in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.">Luke 19:38</a>, He “wept over the city,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-41.htm" title="But rather give alms of such things as you have; and, behold, all things are clean to you....">Luke 11:41-44</a>, and denied that it <span class="ital">even then</span> “knew the time of its visitation” by Him in mercy.

Moreover, that the temple is meant in the passage of Matthew, is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-1.htm" title="And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple.">Matthew 24:1</a>, where, immediately after that most solemn declaration, the Saviour is said to have <span class="ital">departed from the temple</span>. What need, then, could He have had of the demonstrative <span class="greekheb">οὖτος</span> in order to point out that house or temple, seeing that He spake these words in the temple itself? Truly the article <span class="greekheb">ὁ</span>, in such a case, was more than sufficient. I moreover will most freely grant, that the <span class="ital">Jews</span> never called the <span class="ital">temple their own</span> house, but always the house <span class="ital">of the Lord</span> (although S. R. D. S. F. <span class="ital">Lorenz</span>, in his diss. de <span class="ital">Induratione Israelis ante finem dierum finiendâ</span>, Argent. 1771, p. 50, shows the contrary to be the fact).

Van Oosterzee comments here: "Their senses are still blinded. The veil of the Talmud that hangs over their eyes is twice as heavy as the veil of Moses." The promise which concludes this saying of the Master can only refer to the far future, to the day of the penitence of Israel.
