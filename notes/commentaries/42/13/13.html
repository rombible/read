Even bodily infirmities, unless very grievous, should not keep us from public worship on sabbath days. This woman came to Christ to be taught, and to get good to her soul, and then he relieved her bodily infirmity. This cure represents the work of Christ's grace upon the soul. And when crooked souls are made straight, they will show it by glorifying God. Christ knew that this ruler had a real enmity to him and to his gospel, and that he did but cloak it with a pretended zeal for the sabbath day; he really would not have them be healed any day; but if Jesus speaks the word, and puts forth his healing power, sinners are set free. This deliverance is often wrought on the Lord's day; and whatever labour tends to put men in the way of receiving the blessing, agrees with the design of that day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Glorified God - Praised God.

This woman was an emblem of a poor sinner held in the bonds of iniquity by Satan, and led captive by him at his will, who can by no means raise himself; nor is he able to lift up his head to heaven, or look upwards to Christ for deliverance; and yet attends upon the outward ministry, when Christ, in his own time, meets with him under it, and manifests his power and grace, breaks his bonds asunder, delivers him out of Satan's hands, and from the bondage of his own corruptions, sets him straight, and causes him to lift up his head, and look to him for life and salvation; and so puts a new song into his mouth, even praise to God, to whose free grace and favour he readily ascribes his deliverance. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-13.htm" title="And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.">Luke 13:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀνωρθώθη</span>, <span class="ital">she was raised up straight</span>) The upright posture is one that is in consonance with the nobility of man.—<span class="greekheb">ἐδόξαζε</span>, <span class="ital">glorified</span>) The soul and body, after having received help [and relief from above], become, as it were, an instrument just freshly acquired for sounding the Divine praises.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>She was made straight (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>The verb occurs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-16.htm">Acts 15:16</a>, of setting up the tabernacle of David, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-12.htm">Hebrews 12:12</a>, of lifting up the hands which hang down. </body></html>
