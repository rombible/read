And, therefore, they had not the least expectation of his resurrection, notwithstanding he had often predicted it to them: nay, they looked upon the story which the women told them about it as a mere chimera, the delusion of a disordered imagination. <span class="ital">Then arose Peter, </span>&c. — Or rather, <span class="ital">But Peter, arising; ran to the sepulchre </span>— That is, Peter was an exception: the tidings brought by Mary Magdalene, and the other women, did not seem <span class="ital">as idle tales </span>to him, nor to John, who now arose and went with him, and got to the sepulchre before him.

Observe their surprise when they found the stone rolled away, and the grave empty. Christians often perplex themselves about that with which they should comfort and encourage themselves. They look rather to find their Master in his grave-clothes, than angels in their shining garments. The angels assure them that he is risen from the dead; is risen by his own power. These angels from heaven bring not any new gospel, but remind the women of Christ's words, and teach them how to apply them. We may wonder that these disciples, who believed Jesus to be the Son of God and the true Messiah, who had been so often told that he must die, and rise again, and then enter into his glory, who had seen him more than once raise the dead, yet should be so backward to believe his raising himself. But all our mistakes in religion spring from ignorance or forgetfulness of the words Christ has spoken. Peter now ran to the sepulchre, who so lately ran from his Master. He was amazed. There are many things puzzling and perplexing to us, which would be plain and profitable, if we rightly understood the words of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1-11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

It must be remembered that Matthew, Mark (the amanuensis of Peter), and John relate their own memories here, as well as what they had heard from the holy women. Peter and John, we know, were present themselves at the sepulchre. St. Luke received his less detailed and more summarized account of that early morning, years after, most probably from the lips of one of the holy women who had formed part of one of the "two companies" who carried spices for the embalming. </body></html>
