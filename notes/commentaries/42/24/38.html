He, too, had known what it was to be “troubled in spirit” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.">John 11:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.">John 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-21.htm" title="When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.">John 13:21</a>), and out of that experience had grown the tender sympathy which showed itself in the words addressed to the disciples, “Let not your heart be troubled” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-1.htm" title="Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe also in me.">John 14:1</a>). Now they had a trouble of a different kind, and still, as before with the two who were on their way to Emmaus, He seeks to calm and sustain them. He knows even the unuttered thoughts and questionings that are rising in their hearts.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:36-49 Jesus appeared in a miraculous manner, assuring the disciples of his peace, though they had so lately forsaken him, and promising spiritual peace with every blessing. Many troublesome thoughts which disquiet our minds, rise from mistakes concerning Christ. All the troublesome thoughts which rise in our hearts at any time, are known to the Lord Jesus, and are displeasing to him. He spake with them on their unreasonable unbelief. Nothing had passed but what was foretold by the prophets, and necessary for the salvation of sinners. And now all men should be taught the nature and necessity of repentance, in order to the forgiveness of their sins. And these blessings were to be sought for, by faith in the name of Jesus. Christ by his Spirit works on the minds of men. Even good men need to have their understandings opened. But that we may have right thoughts of Christ, there needs no more than to be made to understand the Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why are ye troubled? - Why are you alarmed or frightened?<p>And why do thoughts ... - The word "thoughts" here means "doubts" or suspicions.

If either the papists or the Lutherans could show us Christ’s hands or feet, while they impose upon us to believe that Christ’s body is really present at or in the Lord’s supper, they would not so fright us, nor make so many thoughts arise in us, as they do, about their apprehensions of the nature of a body. But while the papists allow us to handle and to taste the bread, and we find no such things, and the Lutherans suffer our eyes to be open, and we can see no such things, we cannot but conclude, that the body of Christ which they talk of must certainly be a spirit, which (according to our Saviour’s notion) is a substance which hath neither flesh nor bones, as we see the body they would have us to believe hath not; that is to say, that the body they talk of is no body. Our Saviour here proveth that it was his true body, which appeared to them, because, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. It had integral parts, hands and feet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because it might be seen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. It might be handled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. It had flesh and bones, which a spirit hath not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then he shows them his hands and feet. So then our Saviour did not think that the judgment of our senses was to be rejected, concerning the nature of bodies, and his body in particular, and that in its state of exaltation, when it was raised from the dead; Do any of them say that Christ’s body here came through the door, or it could not have been here? How shall that be proved? We can easily tell them how his body might be in the midst of them, though it were not discerned while he was there; even as the eyes of the two disciples were held, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-16.htm" title="But their eyes were held that they should not know him.">Luke 24:16</a></span>, that they could not discern Christ, so the eyes of the disciples might be held now, till he was in the midst amongst them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto them, why are ye troubled,....
