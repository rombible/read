Apocryphal Gospels cannot resist the temptation of describing it. Why did the Four preserve such singular reticence about what would have been irresistible to ‘myth’ makers? Because they were not myth-makers, but witnesses, and had nothing to say as to an act that no man had seen. No doubt, the Resurrection took place in the earliest hours of the first day of the week. The Sun of Righteousness rose before the Easter Day sun. It was midsummer day for Him, while it was but spring for earth’s calendar. That early rising has no setting to follow.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The divergences of the Evangelists reach their maximum in the accounts of the Resurrection, as is natural if we realise the fragmentary character of all the versions, the severely condensed style of Matthew’s, the incompleteness of the genuine Mark’s, the evidently selective purpose in Luke’s, and the supplementary design of John’s. If we add the perturbed state of the disciples, their separation from each other, and the number of distinct incidents embraced in the records, we shall not wonder at the differences, but see in them confirmation of the good faith of the witnesses, and a reflection of the hurry and wonderfulness of that momentous day. Differences there are; contradictions there are not, except between the doubtful verses added to Mark and the other accounts. We cannot put all the pieces together, when we have only them to guide us. If we had a complete and independent narrative to go by, we could, no doubt, arrange our fragments. But the great certainties are unaffected by the small divergences, and the points of agreement are vital. They are, for example, that none saw the Resurrection, that the first to know of it were the women, that angels appeared to them at the tomb, that Jesus showed Himself first to Mary Magdalene, that the reports of the Resurrection were not believed. Whether the group with whom this passage has to do were the same as that whose experience Matthew records we leave undetermined. If so, they must have made two visits to the tomb, and two returns to the Apostles,-one, with only the tidings of the empty sepulchre, which Luke tells; one, with the tidings of Christ’s appearance, as in Matthew. But harmonistic considerations do not need to detain us at present.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Sorrow and love are light sleepers, and early dawn found the brave women on their way. Nicodemus had bound spices in with the body, and these women’s love-gift was as ‘useless’ and as fragrant as Mary’s box of ointment. Whatever love offers, love welcomes, though Judas may ask ‘To what purpose is this waste?’ Angel hands had rolled away the stone, not to allow of Jesus’ exit, for He had risen while it was in its place, but to permit the entrance of the ‘witnesses of the Resurrection.’ So little did these women dream of such a thing that the empty tomb brought no flash of joy, but only perplexity to their wistful gaze. ‘What does it mean?’ was their thought. They and all the disciples expected nothing less than they did a Resurrection, therefore their testimony to it is the more reliable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Luke marks the appearance of the angels as sudden by that ‘behold.’ They were not seen approaching, but at one moment the bewildered women were alone, looking at each other with faces of dreary wonder, and the next, ‘two men’ were standing beside them, and the tomb was lighted by the sheen of their dazzling robes. Much foolish fuss has been made about the varying reports of the angels, and ‘contradictions’ have been found in the facts that some saw them and some did not, that some saw one and some saw two, that some saw them seated and some saw them standing, and so on. We know so little of the laws that govern angelic appearances that our opinion as to the probability or veracity of the accounts is mere guess-work. Where should a flight of angels have gathered and hovered if not there? And should they not ‘sit in order serviceable’ about the tomb, as around the ‘stable’ at Bethlehem? Their function was to prepare a way in the hearts of the women for the Lord Himself, to lessen the shock,-for sudden joy shocks and may hurt,-as well as to witness that these ‘things angels desire to look into.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Their message flooded the women’s hearts with better light than their garments had spread through the tomb. Luke’s version of it agrees with Mark and Matthew in the all-important central part, ‘He is not here, but is risen’ {though these words in Luke are not beyond doubt}, but diverges from them otherwise. Surely the message was not the mere curt announcement preserved by any one of the Evangelists. We may well believe that much more was said than any or all of them have recorded. The angels’ question is half a rebuke, wholly a revelation, of the essential nature of ‘the Living One,’ who was so from all eternity, but is declared to be so by His rising, of the incongruity of supposing that He could be gathered to, and remain with, the dim company of the dead, and a blessed word, which turns sorrow into hope, and diverts sad eyes from the grave to the skies, for all the ages since and to come. The angels recall Christ’s prophecies of death and resurrection, which, like so many of His words to the disciples and to us, had been heard, and not heard, being neglected or misinterpreted. They had questioned ‘what the rising from the dead should mean,’ never supposing that it meant exactly what it said. That way of dealing with Christ’s words did not end on the Easter morning, but is still too often practised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If we are to follow Luke’s account, we must recognise that the women in a company, as well as Mary Magdalene separately, came back first with the announcement of the empty tomb and the angels’ message, and later with the full announcement of having seen the Lord. But apart from the complexities of attempted combination of the narratives, the main point in all the Evangelists is the disbelief of the disciples, ‘Idle tales,’ said they, using a very strong word which appears only here in the New Testament, and likens the eager story of the excited women to a sick man’s senseless ramblings. That was the mood of the whole company, apostles and all. Is that mood likely to breed hallucinations? The evidential value of the disciples’ slowness to believe cannot be overrated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Peter’s race to the sepulchre, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-12.htm" title="Then arose Peter, and ran to the sepulcher; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.">Luke 24:12</a>, is omitted by several good authorities, and is, perhaps, spurious here. If allowed to stand as Luke’s, it seems to show that the Evangelist had a less complete knowledge of the facts than John. Mark, Peter’s ‘interpreter,’ has told us of the special message to him from the risen, but as yet unseen, Lord, and we may well believe that that quickened his speed. The assurance of forgiveness and the hope of a possible future that might cover over the cowardly past, with the yearning to sob his heart out on the Lord’s breast, sent him swiftly to the tomb. Luke does not say that he went in, as John, with one of his fine touches, which bring out character in a word, tells us that he did; but he agrees with John in describing the effect of what Peter saw as being only ‘wonder,’ and the result as being only that he went away pondering over it all, and not yet able to grasp the joy of the transcendent fact. Perhaps, if he had not had a troubled conscience, he would have had a quicker faith. He was not given to hesitation, but his sin darkened his mind. He needed that secret interview, of which many knew the fact but none the details, ere he could feel the full glow of the Risen Sun thawing his heart and scattering his doubts like morning mists on the hills.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-1.htm" title="Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.">Luke 24:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Upon the first day of the week, </span>&c. — On the morning of the first day of the week, when every thing was made ready, all the women, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-10.htm" title="It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.">Luke 24:10</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-1.htm" title="And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.">Mark 16:1</a>; and certain others with them, who were not from Galilee, went out very early, carrying the spices which they had prepared, to the sepulchre, at which some or all of them arrived about the rising of the sun. Whether they went and returned all in one company, or at different times, and by different ways, is not quite certain. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/28-1.htm" title="In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher....">Matthew 28:1-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/16-1.htm" title="And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him....">Mark 16:1-2</a>; John speaks of none of the women who made this visit to the sepulchre but Mary Magdalene. Yet, because he mentions none but her, it does not follow that there were no others with her. In the gospels there are many such omissions. For instance, Mark and Luke speak of one demoniac only, who was cured at Gadara, though Matthew tells us there were two who had devils expelled out of them at that time In like manner Mark and Luke speak only of one blind man, to whom Jesus gave sight near Jericho, while from Matthew it is certain two had that benefit conferred on them there. Before Jesus rode into Jerusalem both the ass and its colt were brought to him, though Mark, Luke, and John speak only of the colt. Wherefore, since it is the manner of the sacred historians in other instances to make such omissions, John may be supposed to have mentioned Mary Magdalene singly in this part of his history, notwithstanding he knew that others had been with her at the sepulchre; and the rather, because his intention was to relate only what things happened in consequence of her information, and not to speak of the transactions of the rest, which his brother historians had handled at large.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-12 See the affection and respect the women showed to Christ, after he was dead and buried. Observe their surprise when they found the stone rolled away, and the grave empty. Christians often perplex themselves about that with which they should comfort and encourage themselves. They look rather to find their Master in his grave-clothes, than angels in their shining garments. The angels assure them that he is risen from the dead; is risen by his own power. These angels from heaven bring not any new gospel, but remind the women of Christ's words, and teach them how to apply them. We may wonder that these disciples, who believed Jesus to be the Son of God and the true Messiah, who had been so often told that he must die, and rise again, and then enter into his glory, who had seen him more than once raise the dead, yet should be so backward to believe his raising himself. But all our mistakes in religion spring from ignorance or forgetfulness of the words Christ has spoken. Peter now ran to the sepulchre, who so lately ran from his Master. He was amazed. There are many things puzzling and perplexing to us, which would be plain and profitable, if we rightly understood the words of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1-11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>Lu 24:1-12.

All the four evangelists give an account of the Resurrection. None of the four, however, attempt to give a <span class="accented">history</span> of it simply from a human point of sight. Each Gospel probably reproduces the special points dwelt on in certain great centres of Christian teaching, in what we should now term different schools of thought. (Attempts have been made by theological scholars to <span class="accented">classify</span> these as Jewish, Gentile, Greek, Roman; but only with indifferent success). The teaching which St. Matthew's Gospel represents, evidently in the Resurrection preaching dwelt with peculiar insistence on the great Galilaean appearance of the Risen. St. Luke confines himself exclusively to the appearance, in Judaea. St. John chooses for his Resurrection instruction scenes which had for their theatre both Galilee and Judaea. St. John, as his central or most detailed piece of teaching, dwells on a fishing scene on Gennesaret, the actors being the well-known inner circle of the apostles. While St. Luke chooses for his detailed Resurrection narrative a high-road in a Jerusalem suburb; and for actors, two devoted, but historically unknown, disciples. Then there is no question of <span class="accented">discrepancies</span> in this portion of the great history. It is not easy to frame a perfectly satisfactory harmony of all the events related by the four, after the Lord had risen; for, in fact, we possess no detailed account or history of what took place in that eventful period in presence of the disciples. We simply have memoranda of eye-witnesses of certain <span class="accented">incidents</span> connected with the Resurrection selected by the great first teachers as specially adapted to their own preaching and instruction. The events of the first Easter Day have Been tabulated by Professor Westcott, in what he terms a provisional arrangement, as follows: - <span class="ref_word">APPROX. TIME.</span> Very early on Sunday <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Resurrection, followed by the earthquake, the descent of the angel, the opening of the tomb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2-4</a>). 5 a.m.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Mary Magdalene, Mary the [mother] of James and Salome, probably with others, start for the sepulchre in the twilight. Mary Magdalene goes before the others, and returns at once to Peter and John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-1.htm">John 20:1</a>, etc.), 5:30 a.m.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Her companions reach the sepulchre when the sun had risen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-2.htm">Mark 16:2</a>). A vision of an angel. Message to the disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5</a>, etc,; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5</a>, etc.). 6 a.m.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another party, among whom is Joanna, come a little later, but still in the early morning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>, etc.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-1.htm">Mark 16:1</a>, note). A vision of "two young men." Words of comfort and instruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>, etc.). 6:30 a.m.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The visit of Peter and John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-3.htm">John 20:3-10</a>). A vision of two angels to Mary Magdalene (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-11.htm">John 20:11 13</a>). About the same time the company of women carry their tidings to the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-10.htm">Luke 24:10</a>, etc.). 7 a.m.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Lord reveals himself to Mary Magdalene (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>). Not long after he reveals him self, as it appears, to the company of women who are returning to the sepulchre. Charge to the brethren to go to Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9</a>, etc.). 4-6 p.m.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The appearance to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-13.htm">Luke 24:13</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>After 4 p.m... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An appearance to St. Peter (ch. 24:34; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>). 8 p.m.... <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The appearance to the eleven and others (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-36.htm">Luke 24:36</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-14.htm">Mark 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the above table one point must be specially noticed: <span class="accented">two companies</span> or separate groups of women are mentioned as going to the sepulchre with the same pious object of assisting in the final embalming of the sacred body.  If this be assumed to be the fact, there will be nothing improbable in the supposition that both these groups of women, all doubtless intimate friends belonging to the little company of the Master, but living probably some distance apart in Jerusalem, came together some time on the sabbath day, and then arranged to meet early on the first day at the sepulchre. Probably the spices purchased in some haste <span class="accented">just before the sabbath commenced</span> were judged inadequate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-56.htm">Luke 23:56</a> we read of a company of women, most probably including all, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> both groups, of holy women, who, after beholding the sepulchre, "returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and <span class="accented">rested the sabbath day."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-1.htm">Mark 16:1</a> we read, "<span class="accented">When</span> <span class="accented">the sabbath was past</span>, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought [not <span class="accented">had</span> bought] sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him." This company (alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-1.htm">Mark 16:1</a>) arrives <span class="accented">the first</span> at the sepulchre, and sees the vision of one angel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5</a>). The other company (alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>) arrives not long after at the sepulchre, and sees the vision of two angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>). In considering the accounts of the Resurrection, the following memoranda will be found suggestive: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">The holy women</span> are the principal actors in all the four accounts of the circumstances connected with the tomb. But their assertions were not believed by the disciples until their statements were confirmed by the Lord's personal appearance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</a>) sums up the great appearances of our Lord, the basis of our faith, he makes no reference to his appearance to Mary Magdalene (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>) or to the women (two Maries mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9, 10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> No evangelist describes the Resurrection-no earthly being having been present. St. Matthew is the evangelist who, in his narrative, goes furthest back. He mentions the shock of the earthquake, the awful presence of the angel, the benumbing terror which seized the guards who were watching. Most probably these signs accompanied the Resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The risen Lord appeared only to his own. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> That no future doubt should be thrown on the <span class="accented">reality</span> of the appearances of the Risen, he showed himself not only to solitary individuals, but to companies, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to two, to the eleven (repeatedly), and to above five hundred brethren at once. And these manifestations took place <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> at different hours of the day; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> in different localities - in Judaea, in Galilee, in rooms of houses, in the open air. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> R<span class="accented">esurrection. At the sepulchre.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them</span>. In the foregoing general note on the Resurrection, the probability has been discussed of the holy women having been divided into two companies who separately came to the sepulchre. St. Luke's notice here refers to the party who arrived the second at the tomb. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/24.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Very early in the morning (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., at deep dawn, or the dawn being deep. It is not uncommon in Greek to find &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;, deep, used of time; as deep or late evening. Plutarch says of Alexander, that he supped "at deep evening;" i.e., late at night. Philo says that the Hebrews crossed the Red Sea "about deep dawn (as here), while others were yet in bed."
