Many troublesome thoughts which disquiet our minds, rise from mistakes concerning Christ. All the troublesome thoughts which rise in our hearts at any time, are known to the Lord Jesus, and are displeasing to him. He spake with them on their unreasonable unbelief. Nothing had passed but what was foretold by the prophets, and necessary for the salvation of sinners. And now all men should be taught the nature and necessity of repentance, in order to the forgiveness of their sins. And these blessings were to be sought for, by faith in the name of Jesus. Christ by his Spirit works on the minds of men. Even good men need to have their understandings opened. But that we may have right thoughts of Christ, there needs no more than to be made to understand the Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jesus stood in the midst of them - This was when the apostles were assembled, and when they had closed the doors for fear of the Jews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-23.htm">Genesis 43:23</a>. It was especially appropriate for Jesus, as he had said before his death that he left "his peace" with them as their inheritance <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>, and as they were now alarmed and fearful at their state, and trembling for fear of the Jews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37, 38. a spirit&#8212;the ghost of their dead Lord, but not Himself in the body (Ac 12:15; Mt 14:26).<p>thoughts&#8212;rather, "reasonings"; that is, whether He were risen or no, and whether this was His very self.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Spirits sometimes (by God’s permission or direction) assumed human shapes. They seeing a human shape, and not able on the sudden to conceive how a human body should come into the midst among them, without any more noise or notice taken of it, were affrighted, as we usually are at the sight of apprehended apparitions. From hence we may conclude, that either the world, and the best men in it, have been in all ages deceived, and a few atheists have been wiser than them all, or there are such beings as spirits. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But they were terrified and affrighted,....

They spoke one to another of the Master; they discussed the empty sepulchre, the angelic vision, the recital by Peter of his interview with the Risen, and were listening to the details of the quiet Emmaus meeting, all hoping for something more; but this sudden, mysterious appearance of their crucified Master in their midst was not, after all, what they had looked for. <span class="accented">It terrified them. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And supposed that they had seen a spirit</span>. How else could they explain his presence in their midst, when the doors were shut? The evangelists make no attempt to explain his sudden appearance. <span class="accented">He was simply there</span> as they spoke of him. It is clear that his presence could be accounted for in no ordinary, natural way. His disciples felt that; hence their supposition that they were looking on a spirit. We can, with our present limited knowledge, form no adequate conception of this resurrection-body of the Lord. It was a reality, no phantasm or appearance; of that the scene about to be described gives us ample evidence. Still, it is clear that his resurrection-body was not bound by the present conditions of material existence of which we are conscious.

He could <span class="accented">come</span> into a closed, barred room. He could be visible or invisible, known or unknown, as he pleased and when he pleased. </body></html>
