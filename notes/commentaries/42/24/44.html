And that method was not an afterthought. It had been given in hints and outlines before; now they were led to see it in its fulness. The three-fold division of the Law, the Prophets (including most of the historic books), and the Psalms (the latter term standing for the whole of the <span class= "ital">Kethubim,</span> the <span class= "ital">Hagiographa</span> or “holy writings,” of which the Psalms were the most conspicuous portion), corresponded to that which was in common use among the Jews.

Under the name <span class="ital">law, </span>the five books called the pentateuch were included; the chief of the historical books were joined with <span class="ital">the prophets, </span>and all the rest with the <span class="ital">psalms. </span>The prophecies, as well as types, relating to the Messiah, are contained in one or other of these books. <span class="ital">Then opened he their understanding to understand the Scriptures </span>— Especially in their reference to him. He had explained many parts of them before, repeatedly, in the course of his ministry, and since his resurrection, especially to the two as they went to Emmaus. But still they understood them not, till he took off the veil from their hearts, by the illumination of his Spirit. <span class="ital">And he said, Thus it is written, </span>&c. — Thus Moses and the prophets foretold that the Messiah should suffer, and rise from the dead on the third day, as Jesus had done; so that, if they had understood the Scriptures, instead of being stumbled at these events, and finding their faith in him as the Messiah shaken by them, they would thereby have found it confirmed. <span class="ital">And that repentance and remission of sins </span>— The two principal doctrines of the gospel, inclusive of, or leading to, all the others; <span class="ital">should be preached </span>— As they continually were by the apostles, both to Jews and Gentiles. And should they not still be preached? are they not as necessary to be preached as ever? <span class="ital">in his name </span>— In imitation of his example as a prophet; through his mediation and grace as a priest; and by his authority and ordinance, as a king; <span class="ital">among all </span>the Gentile <span class="ital">nations — </span>As well as among the Jews; <span class="ital">beginning at Jerusalem </span>— In God’s visible church, where there had long been the greatest light, and the greatest privileges and advantages; where the greatest blessings had been abused, and the greatest guilt contracted; and where, in a little time, judgment would begin, as mercy was to begin now. That the heralds of divine grace should begin at Jerusalem, was appointed both graciously and wisely; <span class="ital">graciously, </span>as it encouraged the greatest sinners to repent, when they saw that even the murderers of Christ were not excepted from mercy; and <span class="ital">wisely, </span>as hereby Christianity was more abundantly attested, the facts being published first on the very spot where they happened. <span class="ital">And ye are witnesses of these things — </span>Chosen of God, and appointed to be such; namely, witnesses of Christ’s life, doctrine, and miracles, and especially of his death, resurrection, and ascension.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:36-49 Jesus appeared in a miraculous manner, assuring the disciples of his peace, though they had so lately forsaken him, and promising spiritual peace with every blessing. Many troublesome thoughts which disquiet our minds, rise from mistakes concerning Christ. All the troublesome thoughts which rise in our hearts at any time, are known to the Lord Jesus, and are displeasing to him. He spake with them on their unreasonable unbelief. Nothing had passed but what was foretold by the prophets, and necessary for the salvation of sinners. And now all men should be taught the nature and necessity of repentance, in order to the forgiveness of their sins. And these blessings were to be sought for, by faith in the name of Jesus. Christ by his Spirit works on the minds of men. Even good men need to have their understandings opened. But that we may have right thoughts of Christ, there needs no more than to be made to understand the Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These are the words - Or this is the "fulfillment" of what I before told you respecting my death.

This division of the Old Testament was in use long before the time of Christ, and was what he referred to here; and he meant to say that in "each of" these divisions of the Old Testament there were prophecies respecting himself. The "particular" subject before them was his "resurrection from the dead." A most striking prediction of this is contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9-11</a>.

He means the <span class="ital">prophets proper</span> who have prophesied of Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm" title="Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:">Luke 24:25</a>), from whom He certainly, moreover, did not think Daniel excluded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-15.htm" title="When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)">Matthew 24:15</a>); and by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΨΑΛΜ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, the <span class="ital">actual</span> Psalms in the <span class="ital">accustomed</span> sense as that portion of the Scripture in which, besides the law and the prophets, the Messianic prophecy is chiefly deposited.

So also older harmonists, and even Grotius. Wieseler, in the <span class="ital">Chronol. Synopse</span>, p. 423 f., like Bengel and others, places between ver. 43 and ver. 44 the <span class="ital">forty days</span>, after the lapse of which ver. 44 ff. is spoken on the day of the ascension. But his proof depends on the <span class="ital">presupposition</span> that in the Gospel and in Acts 1. Luke must needs follow the <span class="ital">same</span> tradition in respect of the time of the ascension. The separation of ver. 44 from what precedes ought not only to have been prevented by the use of the <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> (comp. on ver. 50), but also by the use of the <span class="greekheb">οὗτοι</span>, referring as it does to what goes before. Lange, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> II. 3, p. 1679, represents ver. 45, beginning with <span class="greekheb">τότε διὴνοιξεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., as denoting the forty days’ ministry of Jesus begun on that evening; for he maintains that the unfolding of the knowledge did <span class="ital">not</span> occur <span class="ital">in a moment</span>. But why not? At least there needed no longer time for that purpose than for the instructions of ver. 27. Rightly, Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 5, declares himself opposed to separations of that kind; nevertheless, he afterwards comes back to a similar arbitrary interpolation of the forty days in vv. 45–49. If the place for the forty days has first been found here, there is indeed sufficient room to place the direction of ver. 49, <span class="greekheb">καθίσατε ἐν τῇ πόλει κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., first <span class="ital">after the return</span> of the disciples from Galilee, as Lange does; but Luke does not, since he here absolutely excludes a withdrawal on their part to Galilee. Ewald rightly recognises (<span class="ital">Gesch. des Apost. Zeitalt</span>. p. 93) that Luke limits all appearances of the Risen One to the resurrection Sunday. So also, impartially, Bleek, Holtzmann.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[278] Grotius well says: “nam tunc tantum <span class="greekheb">κατʼ οἰκονομίαν</span> illis aderat.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/24.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me....">Luke 24:44-49</a>. <span class="ital">Parting words</span>.—<span class="greekheb">εἶπε δὲ αὐτοῖς</span>: it is at this point, if anywhere, that room must be made for an extended period of occasional intercourse between Jesus and His disciples such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm" title="To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:">Acts 1:3</a> speaks of. It is conceivable that what follows refers to another occasion. But Lk. takes no pains to point that out. His narrative reads as if he were still relating the incidents of the same meeting. In his Gospel the post-resurrection scenes seem all to fall within a single day, that of the resurrection.—<span class="greekheb">οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι</span>, etc., these are the words. With Euthy. Zig. we naturally ask: which? (<span class="greekheb">οὗτοι</span>· <span class="greekheb">ποῖοι</span>; and there he leaves it). Have we here the concluding fragment of a longer discourse not given by Lk., possibly the end of a document containing a report of the words of Jesus generally (so J. Weiss in Meyer)? As they stand in Lk.’s narrative the sense must be: these events (death and resurrection) fulfil the words I spoke to you before my death.

Luke was dependent on other sources altogether. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Luke, when he wrote the Gospel bearing his name, probably proposed to complete his recital of the close of the earthly ministry of the Lord in his second work, the Acts of the Apostles. His knowledge of what took place after the Resurrection was evidently derived from a source unfamiliar with the Galilaean manifestations of the risen Lord. St. Luke's knowledge of the Ascension seems to have been most precise. He evidently lays great stress upon the importance of this last scene, both as a piece of evidence and as a theme of teaching; for he not only concludes his Gospel with it, but commences his book of the Acts with the same recital, accompanied with further details. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, These are the words which I spoke unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the Law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me</span>. The words, "while I was yet with you," plainly show that, in the Master's mind, the period of his sojourn with men was, in the human sense of the expression, <span class="accented">past.</span> His abode now was elsewhere. This and the next verse (45) probably refer to what the Master said that first Easter evening to the assembled disciples, but the exact fixing the time in the forty days (the time specially mentioned by St. Luke in the Acts as elapsing between the Resurrection and the Ascension, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>) is of comparatively small importance. What is, however, of real moment is the weight Jesus showed that he attached to Old Testament words and types and prophecies by this repeated mention. The remarks of Meyer and Van Oosterzee on this subject are well worthy of being quoted: "If the exegete should read the Old Testament Scriptures without knowing to whom and to what they everywhere point, the New Testament clearly directs his understanding, and places him under an obligation, if he would be a sound Christian teacher, to acknowledge its authority and interpret accordingly. Doubt as to the validity of our Lord and of his apostles' method of expounding, involves necessarily a renunciation of Christianity" (Meyer). "They who consult the teaching of Jesus and his apostles with respect to the prophecies concerning the Messiah, need not grope in uncertainty, but should, nevertheless, remember that the Lord probably directed the attention of the disciples, on this occasion (he is referring to the walk to Emmaus), less to isolated Scriptures than to the whole tenor of the Old Testament in its typical and symbolical character" (Van Oosterzee). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/24.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The words<p>The best texts insert my.<p>Must (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)<p>See on ought not, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>. </body></html>
