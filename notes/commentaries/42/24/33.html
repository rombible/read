If we identify this gathering with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19</a>, there were but ten Apostles present, Thomas being absent.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:28-35 If we would have Christ dwell with us, we must be earnest with him. Those that have experienced the pleasure and profit of communion with him, cannot but desire more of his company. He took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. This he did with his usual authority and affection, with the same manner, perhaps with the same words. He here teaches us to crave a blessing on every meal. See how Christ by his Spirit and grace makes himself known to the souls of his people. He opens the Scriptures to them. He meets them at his table, in the ordinance of the Lord's supper; is known to them in breaking of bread. But the work is completed by the opening of the eyes of their mind; yet it is but short views we have of Christ in this world, but when we enter heaven, we shall see him for ever. They had found the preaching powerful, even when they knew not the preacher. Those Scriptures which speak of Christ, will warm the hearts of his true disciples. That is likely to do most good, which affects us with the love of Jesus in dying for us. It is the duty of those to whom he has shown himself, to let others know what he has done for their souls. It is of great use for the disciples of Christ to compare their experiences, and tell them to each other.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The same hour - Though it was late, and they had stopped, as they thought, for the night, yet such was their joy that they hastened to tell it to their companions and friends. This was natural and proper, and it shows how quick and ready they who have found the Saviour are to tell it to others. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-41.htm">John 1:41-45</a>. Young converts to Christ "should hasten" to tell their joy, and should not shrink at self-denial to proclaim to others what God hath done for the soul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-16.htm">Psalm 66:16</a>.<p>"My lips and cheerful heart, prepare.<p>To make his mercies known:<p>Come, ye that fear my God, and hear.<p>The wonders he hath done.<p>"When on my head huge sorrows fell,<p>I sought his heavenly aid;<p>He saved my sinking soul from hell,<p>And death's eternal shade."<p>The eleven - The eleven apostles. Judas was now dead.

They now tell each to the other how their hearts burned&#8212;were fired&#8212;within them at His talk and His expositions of Scripture. "Ah! this accounts for it: We could not understand the glow of self-evidencing light, love, glory that ravished our hearts; but now we do." They cannot rest&#8212;how could they?&#8212;they must go straight back and tell the news. They find the eleven, but ere they have time to tell their tale, their ears are saluted with the thrilling news, "The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon." Most touching and precious intelligence this. The only one of the Eleven to whom He appeared alone was he, it seems, who had so shamefully denied Him. What passed at that interview we shall never know here. Probably it was too sacred for disclosure. (See on [1746]Mr 16:7). The two from Emmaus now relate what had happened to them, and while thus comparing notes of their Lord's appearances, lo! Christ Himself stands in the midst of them. What encouragement to doubting, dark, true-hearted disciples!<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 33-35. <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-34.htm" title="Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.">Luke 24:34</a></span>, compared with <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm" title="And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:">1 Corinthians 15:5</a></span>, makes some great authors think, that Simon was one of the two, and that Cleopus (who was the other) spake this.

Though it was now evening, and the day was spent and gone; and notwithstanding what business they might have to do at Emmaus, about which they came, and even might not have made an end of eating, or sufficiently refreshed themselves; and though they had had a walk of sixty furlongs that afternoon, yet being big with this appearance of Christ to them, and in haste to impart the joyful news to their fellow disciples, they immediately rose up from table: <p>and returned to Jerusalem; the same night, from whence they had come that day: <p>and found the eleven gathered together; at a certain house known to these two, and who met together in the night season, for the sake of privacy, and for fear of the Jews, and who were now up, though it was late: these are called "eleven", because Judas was now gone from them, and dead; and this being their whole number, it is used, though every one might not be present, as particularly Thomas was not; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a><p>and them that were with them; the seventy disciples, and other believers, both men and women; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/24.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-33.htm" title="And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,">Luke 24:33</a>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ</span>: no time lost, meal perhaps left half finished, no fear of a night journey; the eleven must be told at once what has happened. “They ran the whole way from overjoy” (<span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ περιχαρείας</span>), Euthy.

Late that evening Cleopas and his friend arrived from Emmaus at Jerusalem. Hastening to the accustomed meeting-place of the disciples of Jesus, to tell their wondrous story of the meeting with the risen Master, they find the eleven together full of joy. Peter <span class="accented">had seen</span> and had no doubt conversed with his Master. What a meeting must that have been! The once eager and devoted apostle had probably not gazed on that form in life since he caught the sorrowful look bent on him in the courtyard, when Jesus, bound, passed through and heard his servant denying him with oaths and curses. This appearance to Peter is not recorded in the Gospels. It is, however, placed first of all by St. Paul in his records of the manifestation of the Risen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4-8</a>). </body></html>
