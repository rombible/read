Lord, teach me what it is to pray; Lord, stir up and quicken me to the duty; Lord, direct me what to pray for; teach me what I should say. Christ taught them a prayer, much the same that he had given before in his sermon upon the mount. There are some differences in the words of the Lord's prayer in Matthew and in Luke, but they are of no moment. Let us in our requests, both for others and for ourselves, come to our heavenly Father, confiding in his power and goodness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9-13</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. day by day, &c.&#8212;an extension of the petition in Matthew for "this day's" supply, to every successive day's necessities. The closing doxology, wanting here, is wanting also in all the best and most ancient copies of Matthew's Gospel. Perhaps our Lord purposely left that part open: and as the grand Jewish doxologies were ever resounding, and passed immediately and naturally, in all their hallowed familiarity into the Christian Church, probably this prayer was never used in the Christian assemblies but in its present form, as we find it in Matthew, while in Luke it has been allowed to stand as originally uttered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-2.htm" title="And he said to them, When you pray, say, Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.

St Luke’s version brings out the continuity of the gift (Be giving day by day); St Matthew’s its immediate need (Give to-day). The word rendered ‘daily’ is <span class="ital">epiousion,</span> of which the meaning is much disputed. For a brief discussion of its meaning, see Excursus IV.; but that this prayer is <span class="ital">primarily</span> a prayer for needful earthly sustenance has been rightly understood by the heart of mankind.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">our sins</span>] ‘Trespasses’ is not in our Bible, but comes, as Dr Plumptre notices, from Tyndale’s version. St Matthew uses the word ‘debts,’ which is <span class="ital">implied</span> in the following words of St Luke: “For indeed we ourselves <span class="ital">remit</span> to every one who <span class="ital">oweth</span> to us.” Unforgiving, unforgiven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/18-34.htm" title="And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him....">Matthew 18:34-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm" title="And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you.">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-13.htm" title=" Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you.">Colossians 3:13</a>. The absence of any mention here of the Atonement or of Justification is, as Godet observes, a striking proof of the authenticity of the prayer. The variations are, further, a striking proof that the Gospels are entirely independent of each other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lead us not into temptation</span>] God permits us to be tempted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-15.htm" title="I pray not that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil.">John 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-10.htm" title="Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come on all the world, to try them that dwell on the earth.">Revelation 3:10</a>), but we only yield to our temptations when we are “drawn away of our own lust and enticed” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-14.htm" title="But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.">James 1:14</a>). But the temptations which God permits us are only <span class="ital">human (</span><span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπινοι</span><span class="ital">),</span> not abnormal or irresistible temptations, and with each temptation He makes also <span class="ital">the </span>way to escape (<span class="greekheb">καὶ τὴν ἔκβασιν</span><span class="ital">,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>). We pray, therefore, that we may not be tried above what we are able, and this is defined by the following words: Our prayer is, Let not the tempting opportunity meet the too susceptible disposition. If the temptation comes, quench the desire; if the desire, spare us the temptation. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-2.htm" title="Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungry.">Luke 4:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but deliver us from evil</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">from the Evil One</span>. The article, it is true, would not necessitate this translation, but it seems to be rendered probable by the analogy of similar prayers among the Jews. The last three clauses for daily bread, forgiveness, and deliverance, cover the past, present, and future. “All the tones of the human breast which go from earth to heaven, sound here in their key-notes” (Stier). There is no doxology added. Even in St Matthew it is (almost certainly) a liturgical addition, and no real part of the Lord’s Prayer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-3.htm" title="Give us day by day our daily bread.">Luke 11:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ καθʼ ἡμέραν</span>) Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give us day by day our daily bread</span>. There would need no comment upon this - at first sight - quite simple prayer, but for the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, rendered "daily." This word, in all Greek literature, occurs only in these two evangelists, in SS. Matthew and Luke's report of the Lord's Prayer. Now, does this strange word mean "daily," as our translation gives it; or is it the rough Greek rendering of some Aramaic word of a loftier signification? Most probably our Lord was speaking Aramaic in this place, far away from the capital, in the heart of Palestine. Jerome attempts to Latinize literally the Greek compound word with <span class="accented">supersubstantialis</span>; hence the Rheims Version renders it "supersubstantial," and Wickliffe "over other substance." Generally speaking, the patristic expositors interpret this famous word in such a way that the petition prays, not for the <span class="accented">common bread</span> of everyday life, but for a spiritual food, even the Bread from heaven, which giveth life unto the world. So, with unimportant differences, interpret Origen, Tertullian, Cyril of Jerusalem, Athanasius, Ambrose, and Augustine. Among the moderns who adopt the same view may be cited Olshausen, Stier, and Dean Plumptre. The last-named scholar's words are an admirable answer to any who would abandon this higher and nobler meaning, for the <span class="accented">sake</span> of preserving the reference to the commonplace of everyday life. "So taken, the petition.., raises us to the region of thought in which we leave all that concerns our earthly life in the hands of our Father, without asking him even for the supply of its simplest wants, seeking only that he would sustain and perfect the higher life of our spirit." If, however, the interpretation (on the whole unlikely) of <span class="accented">common</span>, <span class="accented">everyday bread</span>, be accepted, and the simple reference of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-42.htm">Luke 10:42</a> to the necessity for only one dish at table be adopted, then, with the charge to the seventy contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>, to eat and drink "such things as they give," and the further instruction to "take no thought...  what ye shall eat" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-22.htm">Luke 12:22</a>), we have, in this last period of our Lord's public life, clear expressions on the part of the Master of his wish that his followers should ever content themselves with the simplest human food, avoiding not  only all excess, but all extravagance, and even consideration and thought, in providing for anything beyond the simplest daily sustenance. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Daily bread (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Great differences of opinion exist among commentators as to the strict meaning of the word rendered daily. The principal explanations are the following:<p>1. From &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to come on. Hence,<p>a. The coming, or to-morrow's bread.<p>b. Daily: regarding the days in their future succession.<p>c. Continual.<p>d. Yet to come, applied to Christ, the Bread of life, who is to come hereafter.<p>2. From &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769; and &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, being. Hence,<p>a. For our sustenance (physical), and so necessary.<p>b. For our essential life (spiritual).<p>c. Above all being, hence pre-eminent, excellent.<p>d. Abundant.<p>It would be profitless to the English reader to go into the discussion. A scholar is quoted as saying that the term is "the rack of theologians and grammarians." A satisfactory discussion must assume the reader's knowledge of Greek. Those who are interested in the question will find it treated by Tholuck ("Sermon on the Mount"), and also very exhaustively by Bishop Lightfoot ("On a Fresh Revision of the New Testament"). The latter adopts the derivation from &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to come on, and concludes by saying, "the familiar rendering, daily, which has prevailed uninterruptedly in the Western Church from the beginning, is a fairly adequate representation of the original; nor, indeed, does the English language furnish any one word which would answer the purpose so well." The rendering in the margin of Rev. is, our bread for the coming day. It is objected to this that it contradicts the Lord's precept in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a> :, not to be anxious for the morrow. But the word does not necessarily mean the morrow. "If the prayer were said in the evening, no doubt it would mean the following day; but supposing it to be used before dawn, it would designate the day then breaking" (the coming day). "And further, if the command not to be anxious is tantamount to a prohibition against prayer for the object about which we are forbidden to be anxious, then not only must we not pray for to-morrow's food, but we must not pray for food at all; since the Lord bids us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>) not to be anxious for our life" (Lightfoot, condensed). </body></html>
