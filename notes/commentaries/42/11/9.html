For if importunity would prevail thus with a man that was displeased at it, much more will it prevail with God, who is infinitely more kind and ready to do good to us than we are one to another; and is not displeased at our importunity, but accepts it, especially when the object of it is spiritual mercies. If he do not answer our prayers, and grant our requests presently, yet he will answer them in due time, if we continue to pray and exercise faith in his power, love, and faithfulness. Ask, therefore, what God in his word authorizes you to ask, and what you are persuaded it would be for God’s glory that you should receive, <span class="ital">and it shall be given you </span>— Either the thing itself which you ask, or that which is equivalent; either the removal of the thorn in the flesh, or grace sufficient to enable you to bear it. Of this we have an assurance from Christ’s own mouth, who knows his Father’s mind, and in whom all the promises of God are <span class="ital">yea and amen. </span>But we must not only <span class="ital">ask, </span>we must also <span class="ital">seek, </span>in the use of means; must second our prayers with our endeavours; and in asking and seeking, we must continue urgent, still knocking at the same door, and we shall at length prevail. <span class="ital">For every one that asketh receiveth </span>— Even the meanest saint shall have his petition granted, that asks earnestly, importunately, and in faith. <span class="ital">This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm" title="This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.">Psalm 34:6</a>. When we ask of God those things which Christ, in the above prayer, has directed us to ask, namely, that his name may be sanctified; that his kingdom may come, and his will be done; — in these requests we must be importunate, and must never hold our peace day or night. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-7.htm" title="Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you:...">Matthew 7:7-8</a>; where the same passage occurs.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:5-13 Christ encourages fervency and constancy in prayer. We must come for what we need, as a man does to his neighbour or friend, who is kind to him. We must come for bread; for that which is needful. If God does not answer our prayers speedily, yet he will in due time, if we continue to pray. Observe what to pray for; we must ask for the Holy Spirit, not only as necessary in order to our praying well, but as all spiritual blessings are included in that one. For by the influences of the Holy Spirit we are brought to know God and ourselves, to repent, believe in, and love Christ, and so are made comfortable in this world, and meet for happiness in the next. All these blessings our heavenly Father is more ready to bestow on every one that asks for them, than an indulgent parent is to give food to a hungry child. And this is the advantage of the prayer of faith, that it quiets and establishes the heart in God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-11</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-13.

Observe (1) that <span class="greekheb">κἀγώ</span> places what <span class="ital">Jesus</span> is here saying in an incidental parallel with the <span class="greekheb">δώσει αὐτῷ ὅσων χρήζει</span> which immediately precedes: that according to the measure of this granting of prayer, to that extent goes also <span class="ital">His</span> precept to the disciples, etc.; (2) that next to <span class="greekheb">κἀγώ</span> the emphasis rests on <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-8.htm" title="I say to you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs.">Luke 11:8</a> the emphasis rested upon <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span>), inasmuch as Jesus declares what He also, on His part, gives <span class="ital">to the disciples</span> to take to heart. Consequently <span class="greekheb">κἀγώ</span> corresponds to the subject of <span class="greekheb">δώσει</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> to the <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-8.htm" title="I say to you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs.">Luke 11:8</a>. The <span class="ital">teaching itself</span>, so far as Jesus deduces it from that <span class="greekheb">παραβολή</span>, depends on the argument <span class="ital">a minori ad majus</span>: If a friend in your usual relations of intercourse grants to his friend even a troublesome petition, although not from friendship, yet at least for the sake of getting quit of the petitioner’s importunity; how much more should you trust in God that He will give you what you pray for! The tendency of the <span class="greekheb">παραβολή</span> points therefore not, as it is usually understood, to <span class="ital">perseverance</span> in prayer, for of this, indeed, Jesus <span class="ital">says nothing</span> in His application, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you....">Luke 11:9-10</a>, but to the <span class="ital">certainty of prayer being heard</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you....">Luke 11:9-13</a>. <span class="ital">The moral of the story</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-7.htm" title="Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you:...">Matthew 7:7-11</a>).—<span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ ὑμῖν</span>, etc., and <span class="ital">I</span> (the same speaker as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-8.htm" title="I say to you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs.">Luke 11:8</a>) say to <span class="ital">you</span>, with equal confidence. What Jesus says is in brief: you also will get what you want from God, as certainly as the man in my tale got what he wanted; therefore pray on, imitating his <span class="greekheb">ἀναίδεια</span>.

This statement, that those who pray to God shall surely be heard, rests absolutely on Christ's authority. It is not given as a fact which is self-evident, but as a fact which he, the Speaker, knows to be true. The man in bed is pictured in the parable as utterly selfish, regardless of his poorer neighbor's wants and sufferings. So God <span class="accented">seems</span> to us often, as we pray to him day after day, month after month, and our prayer receives no answer; he merely appears to us then as a passionless Spectator of the tragedies and comedies of time. "Children," said the Savior," the selfish man of my story yields to constant importunity. Think ye God, who only <span class="accented">seems</span> to be deaf to man's pleading voice that he may deepen his faith and educate his soul - think ye God is not listening all the while, and will not in the end, in all his glorious generosity, grant the prayer?
