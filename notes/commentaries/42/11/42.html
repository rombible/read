There are two great notes of hypocrites: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. To be more exact, in and zealous for the observation of rituals and the traditions of men, than in and for the observation of the moral law of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

The Talmud even condescends to discuss whether, in tithing the seeds of these garden herbs, the very stalk too ought not to be tithed! The Master, ever tender and considerate, does not blame this exaggerated scrupulosity, if it were done to satisfy even a warped and distorted conscience; what he does find fault with, though, and in the bitterest terms language can formulate, is the substitution of and the clear preference for these infinitely lower duties for the higher. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye tithe (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Tithe is tenth.
