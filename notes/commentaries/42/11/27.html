There is at once a singular agreement in the manner in which each incident, embodying substantially the same lesson, follows on the parable of the Unclean Spirit, and a singular difference in the forms which the incident takes in the two narratives. A possible solution of the problem thus presented may be found in supposing the exclamation which St. Luke records to have been uttered by one of the women who was present when, as St. Matthew relates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-47.htm" title="Then one said to him, Behold, your mother and your brothers stand without, desiring to speak with you.">Matthew 12:47</a>), one said unto Him, “Behold Thy mother and Thy brethren stand without . . .”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which you have sucked....">Luke 11:27-28</a></span>. <span class="ital">As he spake these things, a certain woman, </span>&c. — While Jesus thus reasoned, in confutation of the Pharisees, a woman of the company, ravished with his wisdom, and perhaps believing him to be their long-expected Messiah, expressed her admiration of his character in an exclamation upon the happiness of the woman who had the honour of giving him birth; a thought very natural for a woman. <span class="ital">But he said, Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it — </span>As if he had said, The blessedness which you prize so much, and which could be enjoyed by one woman only, however great, is far inferior to a blessedness which is in every one’s power, namely, that which arises from the knowledge and practice of the will of God.

A charming little incident and profoundly instructive. With true womanly feeling, she envies the mother of such a wonderful Teacher. Well, and higher and better than she had said as much before her (Lu 1:28, 42); and our Lord is far from condemning it. He only holds up&#8212;as "blessed rather"&#8212;the hearers and keepers of God's word; in other words, the humblest real saint of God. (See on [1637]Mt 12:49, 50.) How utterly alien is this sentiment from the teaching of the Church of Rome, which would excommunicate any one of its members who dared to talk in the spirit of this glorious saying!

We are very prone to bless persons from external privileges, and the favours of Divine Providence, which do not at all change or affect the hearts of those to whom they are given; but God looketh with another eye upon persons. Christ doth not here deny his mother to have been blessed; her cousin Elisabeth (<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-42.htm" title="And she spoke out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.">Luke 1:42</a></span>) had pronounced her <span class="ital">blessed amongst women, </span> and the angel had before called her <span class="ital">highly favoured, </span> and told her that she had <span class="ital">found</span> <span class="ital">favour with God.</span> But our Saviour here declareth that her blessing did not so much lie in that her womb bare, and her paps gave suck to him, as in that she was one who heard and kept the word of God; for he pronounces all such as did so principally blessed. Nor must we separate what God hath put together; the blessing is not pronounced to those who barely hear the word of God, the blessed and the unblessed <span class="ital">pariter adeunt, pariter audiunt, </span> they may go to church together, and hear the word together, but the blessing is to <span class="ital">those</span> <span class="ital">that hear the word of God, and keep it.</span> See <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-22.htm" title="But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.">Jam 1:22</a>,23</span>. The word to some that hear it may be <span class="ital">a savour of death unto death.</span> The soul that through grace is made obedient to the will of God, is a more happy soul than the virgin Mary was, considered merely as the mother of Christ, without the consideration of her faith and holiness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And it came to pass as he spoke these things,.... That is, as Christ spoke, or "had finished these sayings", as the Persic version expresses it, before related, in vindication of himself and his miracles, from the blasphemy of the Scribes and Pharisees to their entire confusion, and had delivered the above parable concerning the unclean spirit, which had a particular regard to them: <p>a certain woman of the company: observing the miracle he had wrought, in casting out a devil, and being affected with his discourse, in which he so fully cleared himself, and so strongly confuted his enemies, and set them forth in so just a light: <p>lift up her voice, and said unto him, aloud, in the hearing of all the people, and with great earnestness and fervour: <p>blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked: whether this woman personally knew Mary, the mother of Christ, is not certain; it may be that she was now present, or at least not far off; and this woman hearing that she, with the brethren of Christ, were without, and desired to speak with him, might be the occasion of her uttering these words; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46</a> though they are said not so much in praise, and to the honour of Mary, as in commendation of Christ, from whom, and for the sake of bearing and suckling so great a person, she was denominated blessed as before, both by the angel and Elisabeth,  This was a form of blessing among the Jews: so it is said (s) of R. Joshuah ben Chananiah, a disciple of R. Jochanan ben Zaccai, who lived about these times, , "blessed is she that bore him": and they had also a form of cursing among them, much after the same manner, as   , "cursed be the paps that suckled him" (t). The Jews, in their blasphemous rage against Christ, and all that belong to him, say of Mary, the daughter of Eli, by whom they seem to design the mother of our Lord, that she hangs in the shades by the fibres of her paps (u) but this woman had a different opinion of her. <p>(s) Pirke Abot, c. 2. sect. 8.

A woman (assuredly a <span class="ital">mother</span>), following without restraint her true understanding and impulse, publicly and earnestly pays to Jesus her tribute of admiration.

This answer contains so absolutely the highest truth that lay at the heart of Jesus in His ministry, that Strauss, I. p. 719 (comp. Weizsäcker, p. 169), concludes, very erroneously, from the resemblance of the passage to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-21.htm" title="And he answered and said to them, My mother and my brothers are these which hear the word of God, and do it.">Luke 8:21</a>, that there were two different frames or moulds of the tradition in which this saying of Christ was set.
