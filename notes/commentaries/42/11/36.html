If the “whole body”—life in all its various manifestations—is illumined by the divine light; if the character is in its measure perfect, as that of the Father is perfect, who is Light, and in whom is no darkness at all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1John 1:5</a>); if passion, prejudice, ignorance are no longer there—then that character is . . .” We expect to hear something else as a climax of praise, but there is no higher word possible; the whole character is “full of light,” illumined, flooded by the eternal Light.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:29-36 Christ promised that there should be one sign more given, even the sign of Jonah the prophet; which in Matthew is explained, as meaning the resurrection of Christ; and he warned them to improve this sign. But though Christ himself were the constant preacher in any congregation, and worked miracles daily among them, yet unless his grace humbled their hearts, they would not profit by his word. Let us not desire more evidence and fuller teaching than the Lord is pleased to afford us. We should pray without ceasing that our hearts and understandings may be opened, that we may profit by the light we enjoy. And especially take heed that the light which is in us be not darkness; for if our leading principles be wrong, our judgment and practice must become more so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses are found in Matthew, but in a different connection.

This verse is very puzzling both critically and exegetically. As it stands in T.R. (and in W.H[105]) it appears tautological (De Wette), a fault which some have tried to surmount by punctuation, and some by properly placed emphasis—on <span class="greekheb">ὅλον</span> in the protasis and on <span class="greekheb">φωτεινόν</span> in the apodosis, giving this sense: if thy body be <span class="ital">wholly</span> lighted, having no part dark, then will it be lighted indeed, as when the lamp with its lightning illumines thee (so Meyer). Even thus the saying seems unsatisfactory, and hardly such as Lk., not to say our Lord, could have been responsible for. The critical question thus forces itself upon us: is this really what Lk. wrote? Westcott and Hort think the passage contains “a primitive corruption,” an opinion which J. Weiss (in Meyer, p. 476, note) endorses, making at the same time an attempt to restore the true text. Such attempts are purely conjectural. The verse is omitted in [106], some Latin codd., and in Syr. Cur[107] The new Syr. Sin[108] has it in a form which Mrs. Lewis thus renders: “Therefore also thy body, when there is in it no lamp that hath shone, is dark, thus while thy lamp is shining, it gives light to thee”—a sentence as dark as a lampless body.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[105] Westcott and Hort.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[106] Codex Bezae<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[107]yr.

Godet's comment on this hard and mystic saying of the Blessed is very beautiful: "<span class="accented">When</span>, through the fact of the clearness of thine eye, thy whole body shall be penetrated with light, without there being in thee the least trace of darkness, then the phenomenon which will be wrought in thee will resemble what takes place on thy body when it is placed in the rays of a luminous focus. Jesus means that from the inward part of a perfectly sanctified man there rays forth a splendor which glorifies the external man, as when he is shone upon from without. It is glory as the result of holiness. The phenomenon described here by Jesus is no other than that which was realized in himself on the occasion of his transfiguration, and which he now applies to all believers." There is little doubt that this teaching had been spoken by the Master on one, if not on more than one, previous occasion. In St. Matthew's report, in almost identical language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15</a> and Matthew 6:22), the immediate application was different, and the reference of the lamp put in a prominent place was not to the Resurrection. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The bright shining of a candle (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;)<p>More correctly, as Rev., the lamp with its bright shining. &#x391;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769; means lightning: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>; and that is the usual meaning in classical Greek, though it occurs, rarely, of the light of a lamp. It is used here to emphasize the idea of moral illumination. </body></html>
