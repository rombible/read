(See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) The familiar tone, as of one appealing to each man’s natural good-will, and the dramatic vividness of the dialogue, make it almost unique in our Lord’s teaching. “Midnight” is chosen as being the time at which, above all others, men expect to be left to their repose. The unexpected visitor asks for “three loaves,” one for himself, one for the guest, one as a reserve; and he so far trusts his friend as to hope that he will recognise the claims of his friendship for another. So, the implied lesson is, should the man who prays think that God will care for those for whom he pleads, and will give them also their “daily bread” in both the higher and the lower senses of the word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-5.htm" title="And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;...">Luke 11:5-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he said, </span>&c. — “Having, by a short form, taught his disciples that they were not in prayer to use a multiplicity of words, with vain repetitions; he proceeded to caution them, on the other hand, against coldness, indifference, and slackness in their supplications. The evil of this, and the necessity of asking affectionately, with importunity and perseverance, he taught them by a parable; in which he showed them, that <span class="ital">importunity, </span>that is, earnestness and frequency in asking, are the proper, natural expressions of strong desires, and, by consequence, that God very properly requires these things in men, before he bestows on them such favours as they stand in need of, just as he requires them to be earnestly desirous of these favours before he blesses them therewith.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Which of you shall have a friend, </span>&c. — As if he had said, Who is there of you that has not observed the efficacy of importunate requests? If, for instance, he shall have a friend, and <span class="ital">shall go to him at midnight </span>— The most unseasonable time imaginable for asking a favour; <span class="ital">and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves </span>— Do me this favour on account of our mutual friendship; <span class="ital">for a friend of mine </span>— One to whom I am particularly indebted; <span class="ital">in his journey is come to me </span>— Having travelled so late and long, my friend is both weary and hungry; <span class="ital">and I have nothing to set before him </span>— A case certainly very urgent. <span class="ital">And he from within </span>— Being of a churlish disposition; <span class="ital">shall answer and say, Trouble me not </span>— Do not disturb me thus at so late an hour; what you ask will put me to a great deal of trouble: <span class="ital">the door is now shut </span>— And must have its locks and bolts opened, <span class="ital">and my children are with me in bed </span>— Or as <span class="greekheb">τα παιδια μου μετ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">εμου εις την κοιτην εισιν</span>, may be rendered, <span class="ital">my servants, together with me, are in bed. </span>My servants are in bed as well as myself, and probably they are fast asleep, so that there is nobody at hand to give you what you want. <span class="ital">I cannot rise and give thee </span>— You cannot expect that I will rise and give you the loaves. <span class="ital">I say unto you, Though he will not rise, </span>&c. — This man, though he would not yield to the calls and influence of friendship, yet will he be prevailed upon by the force of importunity; because it shows both the greatness of the supplicant’s distress, and the earnestness of his desire.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:5-13 Christ encourages fervency and constancy in prayer. We must come for what we need, as a man does to his neighbour or friend, who is kind to him. We must come for bread; for that which is needful. If God does not answer our prayers speedily, yet he will in due time, if we continue to pray. Observe what to pray for; we must ask for the Holy Spirit, not only as necessary in order to our praying well, but as all spiritual blessings are included in that one. For by the influences of the Holy Spirit we are brought to know God and ourselves, to repent, believe in, and love Christ, and so are made comfortable in this world, and meet for happiness in the next. All these blessings our heavenly Father is more ready to bestow on every one that asks for them, than an indulgent parent is to give food to a hungry child. And this is the advantage of the prayer of faith, that it quiets and establishes the heart in God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he said unto them ... - Jesus proceeds to show that, in order to obtain the blessing, it was necessary to "persevere" in asking for it. For this purpose he introduces the case of a friend's asking bread of another for one who had come to him unexpectedly. His design is solely to show the necessity of being "importunate" or persevering in prayer to God.<p>At midnight - A time when it would be most inconvenient for his friend to help him; an hour when he would naturally be in bed and his house shut.<p>Three loaves - There is nothing particularly denoted by the number "three" in this place. Jesus often threw in such particulars merely to fill up the story, or to preserve the consistency of it.<p>My children are with me in bed - This does not necessarily mean that they were in the "same bed" with him, but that they were "all" in bed, the house was still, the door was shut, and it was troublesome for him to rise at that time of night to accommodate him. It should be observed, however, that the customs of Orientals differ in this respect from our own. Among them it is not uncommon indeed it is the common practice for a whole family - parents, children, and servants - to sleep in the same room. See "The Land and the Book," vol. i. p. 180. This is "not" to be applied to God, as if it were troublesome to him to be sought unto, or as if "he" would ever reply to a sinner in that manner. All that is to be applied to God in this parable is simply that it is proper to "persevere" in prayer. As a "man" often gives because the request is "repeated," and as one is not discouraged because the favor that he asks of his neighbor is "delayed," so God often answers us after long and importunate requests. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-8. at midnight &#8230; for a friend is come&#8212;The heat in warm countries makes evening preferable to-day for travelling; but "midnight" is everywhere a most unseasonable hour of call, and for that very reason it is here selected.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 5-9.

The teaching contained in vers. 1-13 may be well summarized as the Master's <span class="accented">lesson on prayer.</span> The disciples, when they heard Jesus pray, asked him to instruct them in the holy art. The Lord then suggested to them a series of short <span class="accented">subjects</span> for constant prayer, and further gave them <span class="accented">words</span> in which they could embody these subjects, and then proceeded to press upon them that this constant seeking help from God should never be interrupted; no discouragements were ever to prevent their praying. "See," said the Master, "this" (telling them the little parable) "is what God appears to be when prayer receives no answer." Of course, he is not what he appears to be (see ver. 9). The truth concerning <span class="accented">God</span> does not really come out before the words of ver. 9; but the parable, grotesque and quaint, and picturing a common scene of everyday life, arrested the attention <span class="accented">then</span> as it has done in many a million cases since, and told men out of heart and despairing of receiving any answer to their prayers, to think. Well, here is a case in point; but is God like this? The Lord replies shortly to this mute heart-query. <span class="accented">At midnight.</span> The whole picture is drawn from a poor man's house - children and parents sleeping in one room. "With me in bed" probably suggests what is common in an Eastern house, where a divan or raised platform (rendered here "bed") often filled well-nigh half the room. The hour <span class="accented">midnight</span> has nothing strained in it - it was frequently the practice in the East to travel by night, and so to escape the great heat of the day. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Set before<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-16.htm">Luke 9:16</a>. </body></html>
