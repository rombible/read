There are, however, some remarkable variations, each of which suggests some questions of interest. (1) The words here appear at first sight as if they were a quotation from a book recognised as of divine authority, and not a few critics have supposed that there was such a book, bearing the title of “The Wisdom of God,” either when our Lord spoke, or when St. Luke wrote. On the other hand there is no trace of the existence of a book with that name; and if it had been prominent enough to be quoted, as it seems to be quoted here, it could scarcely have failed to have left its impress elsewhere. On the whole, then, it seems best to look on the words as a solemn utterance which our Lord’s human soul had received as an oracle from God, and which was therefore proclaimed by Him as coming from His Wisdom. His words that “Wisdom is justified of her children” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm" title="The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.">Matthew 11:19</a>), present, it is obvious, another example of the same way of speaking of the divine purpose. (2) For “the prophets, and wise men, and scribes” of St. Matthew, we have here “prophets and apostles.” The combination points to a Christian, not a pre-Christian, terminology, and is the first example of the union of the two terms that afterwards became normal. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a>.) It goes some way, it may be remarked, to confirm the view suggested in that Note, that two distinct bodies, known respectively as “Prophets” and “Apostles,” had already been appointed, and that as the Twelve answered to the latter, so did the Seventy to the former.<p><span class= "bld">Some of them shall they slay and persecute.</span>—Note, as perhaps characteristic of St. Luke, the absence of the specific forms of persecution, “crucifying” and “scourging in the synagogues.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:37-54 We should all look to our hearts, that they may be cleansed and new-created; and while we attend to the great things of the law and of the gospel, we must not neglect the smallest matter God has appointed.

The Syriac version only reads "wisdom"; by which seems to be meant not the perfection of God's wisdom: though it is usual with the Jews to represent the divine perfections as speaking, as the justice and mercy of God. They say (b), that <p>"when the holy blessed God sought to make Hezekiah the Messiah, and Sennacherib, Gog, and Magog, , "the property of judgment", or "justice, said" before the holy, blessed God, Lord of the world, &amp;c.'' <p>and so the sense may be here, that the infinite wisdom of God said within himself, determined in his own breast, to do what follows. But I rather think that Christ is intended, who, as God, is the essential wisdom of God; and, as man and mediator, has the spirit of wisdom resting on him, and the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hid in him; since this is said by Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-34.htm">Matthew 23:34</a> though the words here seem to be the words of the evangelist relating what Christ had said.

Accordingly, it is to be supposed (Neander, <span class="ital">L. J</span>. p. 655; Gess, <span class="ital">Person Chr</span>. p. 29; comp. also Ritschl, <span class="ital">Evang.

Allied to this is the idea of the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>. According to this, however, the original form of the passage is not to be found in Luke (Olshausen, Bleek); for while Matthew gives this remarkable utterance in a directly present form, Luke’s method of recording it transfers to the mouth of Jesus what rather was a <span class="ital">later</span> mode of citing it, and gives it in the shape of a result of reflective theology akin to the doctrine of the Logos.[149]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκδιώξ</span>.] to drive out of the land.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ ἘΚΖΗΤ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>] an appointment in the divine decree.

He is said to have referred the entire utterance to the <span class="ital">Old Testament</span> prophets, and on that account to have placed before it <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ σοφία τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ εἶπεν</span>, in order to give to it the character of an ancient prophecy, which, however, had no existence at all, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[148] Strauss also, in Hilgenfeld’s <span class="ital">Zeitschrift</span>, 1863, p. 87 ff., who is thinking entirely of a <span class="ital">Christian</span> document.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[149] The utterance in Matthew, <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ ἀποστέλλω κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., was historically indicated in the Church by: <span class="greekheb">ἡ σοφία τοῦ Θεοῦ εἶπεν</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἀποστελῶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. And Luke here makes <span class="ital">Jesus Himself</span> speak in this later mode of indicating it. It is a <span class="greekheb">ὕστερον πρότερον</span> in <span class="ital">form</span>. According to Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. I. p. 101 (comp. also Schegg), Jesus announces God’s counsel in the form of a word of God. Comp. Grotius and van Hengel, <span class="ital">Annot</span>. p. 16 f. To this view <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτούς</span> (instead of <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὑμᾶς</span>) would certainly not be opposed, since those whom the speech concerned might be opposed as third persons to the wisdom of God which was speaking. But instead of <span class="greekheb">εἶπεν</span> might be expected <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>; for <span class="ital">now</span> through <span class="ital">Jesus</span> the divine wisdom would declare its counsel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-10.htm" title="Why I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do always err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.">Hebrews 3:10</a>, to which Hofmann refers, is different, because there <span class="greekheb">εἶπον</span> in connection with <span class="greekheb">προσώχθισα</span> actually relates to the past). Moreover, if by <span class="greekheb">ἡ σοφία τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> were not meant the <span class="ital">personal</span> wisdom of God that appeared in <span class="ital">Christ</span>, and emitted the utterance, it would not be conceivable why it should not simply have been said: <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο καὶ ὁ Θεὸς λέγει</span>. Nowhere else in the New Testament is a declaration of God called a declaration of the divine wisdom. Besides, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-34.htm" title="Why, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall you whip in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:">Matthew 23:34</a>, <span class="ital">Jesus</span> is the subject of <span class="greekheb">ἀποστελῶ</span>; and this is also the case in the passage before us, if <span class="greekheb">ἡ σοφία τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> is understood of the person of Christ as being the personal self-revelation of the divine wisdom. <span class="ital">Christ</span> sends to His Church the prophets and apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-3.htm" title="Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.">Luke 10:3</a>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm" title="And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;">Ephesians 4:11</a>. Riggenbach’s explanation (<span class="ital">Stud. u.

The expression, "wisdom of God," has been a difficulty to commentators. The words have been referred <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to a quotation of the Lord's from a lost apocryphal book of that name; but we have no instance of Jesus ever quoting from an  apocryphal book, known or unknown. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> St. Luke is here quoting from the similar passage in St. Matthew's Gospel, which, when he was compiling his Gospel, lay before him, and alludes to the earlier memoir as "The Wisdom of God." Against this we have no proof that St. Luke ever saw St. Matthew's Gospel, but a strong probability exists to the contrary; besides which, the expression is never used by an apostolic writer in such a sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> A reference is here intended to the Book of Proverbs, which in the early Church was known by the title of "The Wisdom of God," and the passage referred to is <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-20.htm">Luke 1:20</a> and 31. Putting aside all these, it seems best to consider the expression simply as a solemn utterance of the Lord, in which he identifies himself with the "Wisdom of God." And this certainly is borne out by a comparison with the report of St. Matthew of a similar announcement made by Jesus on another occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-34.htm">Matthew 23:34</a>). There we read that the Master said, "Behold, I send unto you prophets," etc. The I is emphatic, and betrays the Divine self-consciousness of Jesus. For a moment the poor Rabbi of Galilee is forgotten, and in his lofty indignation, in his profound sorrow over the stubborn heart of Israel, on both the occasions in which he is reported to have spoken these words of awful prophecy, the Redeemer identifies Himself with <span class="accented">God.</span> St. Matthew, "Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets," etc.; St. Luke, "Therefore also said <span class="accented">the Wisdom of God</span>, I will send them prophets," etc. The form of the prediction and the original thought were both, no doubt, derived by Jesus from the solemn passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-19.htm">2 Chronicles 24:19</a>, "Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the Lord;...  but they would not give ear," etc. This was followed immediately by the account of the preaching of Zechariah (the instance chosen here by the Lord, ver. 51), and how the faithful witness was stoned by the people in the court of the house of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute.</span> The title "apostle" is joined here with the well-known title of "prophet." The earthly reward that these <span class="accented">his</span> servants, the apostles, will meet with at the hands of the people of Israel will be the same as that meted out to those old martyr-prophets, viz. persecution and death. </body></html>
