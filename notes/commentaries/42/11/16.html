The heart of every unconverted sinner is the devil's palace, where he dwells, and where he rules. There is a kind of peace in the heart of an unconverted soul, while the devil, as a strong man armed, keeps it. The sinner is secure, has no doubt concerning the goodness of his state, nor any dread of the judgment to come. But observe the wonderful change made in conversion. The conversion of a soul to God, is Christ's victory over the devil and his power in that soul, restoring the soul to its liberty, and recovering his own interest in it and power over it. All the endowments of mind of body are now employed for Christ. Here is the condition of a hypocrite. The house is swept from common sins, by a forced confession, as Pharaoh's; by a feigned contrition, as Ahab's; or by a partial reformation, as Herod's. The house is swept, but it is not washed; the heart is not made holy. Sweeping takes off only the loose dirt, while the sin that besets the sinner, the beloved sin, is untouched. The house is garnished with common gifts and graces. It is not furnished with any true grace; it is all paint and varnish, not real nor lasting. It was never given up to Christ, nor dwelt in by the Spirit. Let us take heed of resting in that which a man may have, and yet come short of heaven. The wicked spirits enter in without any difficulty; they are welcomed, and they dwell there; there they work, there they rule. From such an awful state let all earnestly pray to be delivered.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22-30</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 11:14-36.

But our Lord refused their demand. Miracles were not to be granted to insolent unbelief; nor were they of the nature of mere prodigies. Besides it was His will to win conviction, not to enforce acceptance. This seems therefore to have been the one weapon of attack which the Pharisees found most effective against Him,—the one which most deeply wounded His spirit and finally drove Him away from the plain of Gen- nesareth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/8-11.htm" title="And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him....">Mark 8:11-12</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-16.htm" title="And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.">Luke 11:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἕτεροι</span>, <span class="ital">others</span>) Their cavil is met in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-29.htm" title="And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet....">Luke 11:29-30</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven</span>. As in the case of Manoah or Elijah. Some such sign as the pillar of fire these cavilling Jews probably referred to. No doubt, in the course of the public teaching, in the presence of his mighty acts, Jesus was asked for such a sign on several occasions. His questioners would argue after this fashion: "We suspect that these great works of yours, especially your strange power over spirits of evil,  are derived from the realm of darkness; now, show us that our suspicion is baseless by some splendid sign of the visible approval of Heaven." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Tempting<p>See on temptation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>.<p>Sign<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20</a>. </body></html>
