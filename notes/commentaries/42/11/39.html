The verses that follow stand in the relation to the great discourse against the Pharisees in that chapter, as the Sermon on the Plain (Luke 6) does to the Sermon on the Mount. Here, too, we recognise another instance, not of a narrative misplaced, but of words actually repeated. All past experiences, all faults previously noted, were gathered at last into one great and terrible invective. We note, as an instance of independence, St. Luke’s use of a different Greek word for “platter,” viz., that which is elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-8.htm" title="And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John Baptist's head in a charger.">Matthew 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-11.htm" title="And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.">Matthew 14:11</a>) better translated <span class= "ital">charger,</span> the large central dish, as distinguished from the smaller “platter” or side-dish. For the “excess” of St. Matthew, St. Luke has the more generic “wickedness.” From one point of view the words are more startling here than in their context in St. Matthew. There they are spoken as in open conflict with a class, here they are addressed to an individual member of the class, and by One whom he had invited as a guest. It must be remembered, however, that there was a touch of supercilious scorn in all these invitations, still more, perhaps, in the looks and whispers in which the wonder in this instance showed itself; and the words point to secret sins which the Searcher of hearts knew, and which it was necessary to reprove.<span class= "bld"><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:37-54 We should all look to our hearts, that they may be cleansed and new-created; and while we attend to the great things of the law and of the gospel, we must not neglect the smallest matter God has appointed.

"Ravening." Robbery, plunder. Here the sense is that the cup and platter were filled with what had been unjustly taken from others. That is, they lived by their wickedness; their food was procured by dishonesty and extortion. This was a most terrible charge; and as it was applied, among others, to the man who had invited the Saviour to dine with him, it shows that nothing would prevent his dealing faithfully with the souls of people. Even in the Pharisee's own house, and when expressly invited to partake of his hospitality, he loved his soul so much that he faithfully warned him of his crimes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39-41. cup and platter&#8212;remarkable example of our Lord's way of drawing the most striking illustrations of great truths from the most familiar objects and incidents of life.<p>ravening&#8212;rapacity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 39,40.

We must not imagine that our Saviour here reflects upon the cleansing of vessels in which we put our meat and drink, for undoubtedly, as to them, the Pharisees washed both the inside and the outside.

Our Saviour doth therefore certainly compare the Pharisees to dishes or platters washed or scoured only on the outside, and blames their hypocrisy in this, that they were mighty solicitous about an outside purity and cleanness, but for the inward purity of the heart and soul, they took no care at all about that; they were very scrupulous about undefiled hands, but nothing at all about having their souls and inward powers and affections undefiled. This he telleth them was most egregious folly, for God, that made the body, made the soul also, and therefore would exact a purity in the inward as well as the outward man, especially considering that he loveth truth in the inward parts. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord said unto him,....

In Galilee He said, in this passage [<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-49.htm" title="Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:">Luke 11:49</a>], “I will send [Future] Prophets and Apostles among them.” Then also at Jerusalem [<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-34.htm" title="Why, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall you whip in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:">Matthew 23:34</a>], He said, “Behold, I send” [Present]: To wit, in the intervening time He was come nearer to the actual sending of them.—<span class="ital">Harm.</span>, p. 398.]—<span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>, <span class="ital">now</span>) The particle has the force of demonstrating a thing present: on this account the LXX. employ it for <span class="greekheb">הנה</span>, Behold, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm" title="For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.">2 Kings 7:6</a>; and in this passage it at the same time involves an antithesis between external purity and impurity; in the same way as nunc among the Latins has often the force of atqui.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ἔξωθεν</span>) that which is exterior (the outside): for instance, the exterior of a very clean cup.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ἔσωθεν ὑμῶν</span>) your interior (inner man), viz. your manner of life.—<span class="greekheb">γέμει</span>, is full) like a cup or dish. First, <span class="greekheb">ἔξωθεν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἔσωθεν</span> are adverbs; then in Matthew, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/23-25.htm" title="And he released to them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will....">Luke 23:25-26</a>, it is the cup and the dish that are said to be full, <span class="greekheb">γέμειν</span>: in Luke it is “the inward part” itself of the Pharisees. The exterior of vessels is not only convex, but also concave [what is commonly, though not correctly, called the inside]: the interior is both the heart and the manner of life.[111] It makes no difference whether <span class="greekheb">ἁρπαγὴ</span>, <span class="ital">rapine</span>, be taken, in the material sense, for the thing carried off, or, in the formal sense, for rapaciousness. However, it is taken in the formal sense, inasmuch as in Matthew <span class="greekheb">ἀκρασία</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἀδικία</span>, <span class="ital">intemperance</span> or <span class="ital">injustice</span>, and in Luke <span class="greekheb">πονηρία</span>, <span class="ital">malignity, wickedness</span>, are added. It may be thus paraphrased: Ye Pharisees keep clean the part in the vessel which is exterior; but your interior is full of rapaciousness and malignity. Ye fools, did not He, who made the <span class="ital">exterior</span> thing, to wit, <span class="ital">the vessel</span>, at the same time also make the <span class="ital">interior</span> thing, namely, the heart?

Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?</span> Many of the words spoken on this occasion had been uttered by the Master previously. The variations in them, slight though they be, necessitate often quite a different interpretation. This helps us to come to the conclusion that in these cases the Lord must have spoken such sayings on different occasions. In this place, for instance, in the report of a similar accusation levelled against the Pharisees reported by St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25</a>), the second clause of the verse, which treats of the outside of the cup and the platter, reads thus: "<span class="accented">but</span> within they are full of extortion and excess." The meaning of this is - while every care had been taken to purify the cup and the dish, <span class="accented">no pains whatever had been paid to the source whence came the contents of these.</span> They were too often the proceeds of extortion, they were too frequently consumed with self-indulgence. But here, in St. Luke, the second clause reads, "your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness." The meaning of these words is, "In spite of your extreme care for the vessels of your table, <span class="accented">your whole moral life is unclean and defiled.</span> Are you not," argues the Master, "fools to lay down such strict rules to avoid <span class="accented">outward</span> defilement, while within, in the soul, you allow all manner of wickedness?
