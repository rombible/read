Let any of you, that is a father, and knows the heart of a father, a father’s affection to, and care for, a child, say, <span class="ital">if </span>his <span class="ital">Song of Solomon ask bread </span>to satisfy his hunger, <span class="ital">will he give him a stone </span>— In the shape of a loaf? or, <span class="ital">If he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent </span>— Which has some resemblance of a fish; <span class="ital">or if he ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion </span>— Which, instead of nourishing him, might sting him to death?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Naturalists tell us, that the body of a scorpion is very like an egg, especially if the scorpion be of the white kind, which is the first species mentioned by Ælian, Avicenna, and others. Bochart has produced testimonies to prove that the scorpions in Judea were about the bigness of an egg; and therefore there, a white scorpion being very like an egg, might to children, who were not capable of distinguishing the one from the other, be offered in place thereof, if the person so doing meant that it should sting and destroy them. These different instances are mentioned by Jesus, in order that the doctrine which he is here inculcating might make the stronger impression upon his hearers.

We must come for what we need, as a man does to his neighbour or friend, who is kind to him. We must come for bread; for that which is needful. If God does not answer our prayers speedily, yet he will in due time, if we continue to pray. Observe what to pray for; we must ask for the Holy Spirit, not only as necessary in order to our praying well, but as all spiritual blessings are included in that one. For by the influences of the Holy Spirit we are brought to know God and ourselves, to repent, believe in, and love Christ, and so are made comfortable in this world, and meet for happiness in the next. All these blessings our heavenly Father is more ready to bestow on every one that asks for them, than an indulgent parent is to give food to a hungry child. And this is the advantage of the prayer of faith, that it quiets and establishes the heart in God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-11</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-13.

Our Lord illustrates and confirms what he had said before by an instance common among men: the relation between a father and a son is natural, and it is very near; and it is usual for a son, when hungry, and at the proper times of meals, to ask bread of his father: and when he does, <p>will he give him a stone? should he do so, he would show that his heart was as hard, or harder than the stone he gives: <p>or if he ask a fish, will he, for a fish, give him a serpent? And endeavour to deceive him by the likeness of the one to the other, especially some sort of fish, which would poison or sting him, but not refresh and nourish him: such inhuman brutish parents are not surely to be found; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/7-9.htm">Matthew 7:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-10.htm">Matthew 7:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/luke/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-11.htm" title="If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?...">Luke 11:11-13</a>.

The gift of things similar but so different would be cruel mockery of which almost no father would be capable. Hens were not known in ancient Israel.
