The derivation of “allow” from the French <span class= "ital">allouer</span> and the Latin <span class= "ital">adlaudare,</span> shows this to be the true sense.

Or, whereas they did this under specious pretences of disliking their fathers' sins, which yet secretly they loved, and were of the same wicked disposition against the ministers of the word, and which they would quickly show; this discovered their hypocrisy, and confirmed the character Christ had before given of them; for it follows, <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Truly <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</span><p>(k) When you persecute God's servants like mad men, even as your fathers did, though you try and cover it with a pretence of godliness, yet nonetheless, by beautifying the sepulchres of the prophets, what else are you doing but glorying in your father's cruelty, and setting up monuments (as it were) in glory and triumph of it?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-48.htm" title="Truly you bear witness that you allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and you build their sepulchers.">Luke 11:48</a> points the moral.—<span class="greekheb">ἄρα</span>: perhaps with Schleiermacher we should write <span class="greekheb">ἆρα</span>, taking what follows as a question.—<span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομεῖτε</span>, ye <span class="ital">build</span>, absolutely (without object, <span class="ital">vide</span> note 3 above).
