Outward, positive ceremonial law, ordering the cleansing of the outside of the cup and of the platter, the eternal moral law requiring truth in the inward parts,—these had, to say the least, the same Maker, and one was not to be neglected for the other.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:37-54 We should all look to our hearts, that they may be cleansed and new-created; and while we attend to the great things of the law and of the gospel, we must not neglect the smallest matter God has appointed.

Your conduct is not merely "foolish," but it is a cloak for sin - designed to countenance wickedness.<p>Did not he ... - Did not God, who made the "body," make also the "soul?" You Pharisees take great pains to cleanse the "body," under a pretence of pleasing "God." Did "he"" not also make the "mind?" and is it not of as much importance that "that" should be pure, as that the body should? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40. that which is without, &c.&#8212;that is, He to whom belongs the outer life, and right to demand its subjection to Himself&#8212;is the inner man less His?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-39.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Now do you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.">Luke 11:39</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without,.... That is, made clean that which is without, or the outside of the cup and platter; <p>make that which is within also? does not he make the inside clean likewise? whoever washes a cup or platter, but washes and makes clean the inside, as well as the outside? and so ye who are so very careful to have your cups and platters clean, should be as careful what you put in them, that they are clean also; not only that they are clean according to the law, in a ceremonial sense, but in a moral sense, that they are honestly and lawfully got. The word,  rendered "made" and "make", answers to the Hebrew word  which sometimes signifies to beautify and adorn, and to cleanse, and remove away filth, as by paring nails, and washing the feet; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12</a> it is said of a captive woman that a man takes into his house for his wife, among other things,  "she shall make her nails"; that is, "pare" them, as we render it, and remove the filth from them. Again, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-24.htm">2 Samuel 19:24</a> it is said of Mephibosheth, that from the day king David departed, he had not,  "made his feet"; that is, as the Targum renders it, , "he had not washed his feet"; and so other Jewish interpreters understand it, either of his having not washed his feet, much less his whole body (w), or of not having pared his nails (x); and so the Vulgate Latin renders it, that he came to meet the king "with unwashen feet"; which may serve to illustrate and confirm the sense before given: though interpreters generally understand this of God, as the maker of the soul, as well as of the body; and therefore the purity of the former should be regarded, as well as that of the latter. <p>(w) R.

Kuinoel (following Elsner and Kypke) makes the sentence affirmative: “<span class="ital">Non qui exterius purgavit</span>, pocula patinasque, (eadem opera) <span class="ital">etiam interius purgavit</span>, cibos;” but this view, besides being open to the objection drawn from <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἔσωθεν ὑμῶν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-39.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Now do you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.">Luke 11:39</a>, is opposed to the <span class="ital">usus loquendi</span> of the words <span class="greekheb">ἐποίησε</span> and <span class="greekheb">ποιήσας</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-40.htm" title="You fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?">Luke 11:40</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἄφρονες</span>, stupid men! not so strong a word as <span class="greekheb">μωροὶ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-17.htm" title="You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?">Matthew 23:17</a>).—<span class="greekheb">οὐχ ὁ ποιήσας</span>, etc.: either a question or an assertion.

As a question the reference will be to God, and the sense: did not the Maker of the world make the inside of things as well as the outside? Why therefore lay so exclusive stress on the latter? The outside and inside are variously taken as body and spirit (Theophy., Euthy., etc.), vessel and contents (Wolf, Hofmann), vessel and human spirit (Bengel).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">40</span>. <span class="ital">that which is within also</span>] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/7-18.htm" title="And he said to them, Are you so without understanding also?
