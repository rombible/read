The two facts together complete the picture.<p><span class= "bld">The baptism of repentance.</span>—See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/3-1.htm" title="In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,">Matthew 3:1-11</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/1-4.htm" title="John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.">Mark 1:4-6</a>. In his description of the Baptism, St. Luke agrees verbally with the latter.<p>(3) Going upward from Zerubbabel and Salathiel, which are common to both genealogies, we come again across a different succession—St. Luke leading us to Nathan as the son of David, and St. Matthew to Solomon. Here again we have in St. Luke twenty-two generations from Salathiel to David, inclusive, while in St. Matthew we have but sixteen.<p>(3) There is, in the appearance in St. Matthew’s list of Jeconias (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm" title="And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,">1Chronicles 3:17</a>), and in St. Luke’s of Neri, as the father of Salathiel, a problem to be solved; but an adequate, though necessarily conjectural, solution is not far to seek. To assume that the Salathiel of the one list is not identical with that in the other, is to cut the knot instead of disentangling it. But it may be noticed that in the earlier registers connected with the name of the historical Salathiel, father of the Zerubbabel who was the leader of the Jews on their return from Babylon, there is an obvious complication. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-19.htm" title="And the sons of Pedaiah were, Zerubbabel, and Shimei: and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, and Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister:">1Chronicles 3:19</a>, Zerubbabel is the son of Pedaiah, the brother of Salathiel. The language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-30.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Write you this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting on the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.">Jeremiah 22:30</a> at least suggests the thought that Jeconiah died without an heir. What seems probable accordingly is that the royal line descended from Solomon, expired in Jeconiah, and that Salathiel, the son of Neri, the representative of the line of Nathan, took his place in the line of inheritance. It is not without significance that in the contemporary prophecy of Zechariah, the house of Nathan appears, for the first time in the history of Judah, as invested with a special pre-eminence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-12.htm" title="And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;">Zechariah 12:12</a>). The difference in the number of the names admits of the same explanation as before.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/3-3.htm" title="And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;...">Luke 3:3-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he came into all the country about Jordan </span>— He made his first public appearance in the wilderness of Judea, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm" title="In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,">Matthew 3:1</a>; that is, in the uncultivated and thinly-inhabited parts of the hill-country round Hebron, where his father dwelt; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-39.htm" title="And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;...">Luke 1:39-40</a>; but after his fame was spread abroad, and many came to him, he left Judea and passed over Jordan, residing chiefly at Bethabara, for the conveniency of baptizing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.">John 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-40.htm" title="And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he stayed.">John 10:40</a>.

In other words, he enjoined the penitent to be baptized, as a testimony, on their part, of the sincerity of their repentance, and on the part of John, who administered this ordinance by the commandment of God, as a seal or token that their sins were remitted. <span class="ital">As it is written in the book of Esaias, The voice of one crying, </span>&c. — See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/40-3.htm" title="The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God....">Isaiah 40:3-5</a>. The evangelist, by citing this prophecy, as accomplished in the Baptist’s preaching, shows us its true meaning. Isaiah, by expressions taken from the custom of kings, who commonly have the roads through which they pass prepared for them, signified that the Messiah’s forerunner was to prepare his way, by intimating that the institutions of Moses were to be relinquished as the means of salvation, and by exhorting the people to repentance and amendment of life. Matthew tells us, that John enforced his exhortations to repentance from the consideration that the Messiah’s kingdom was at hand; the kingdom of heaven, foretold by Daniel the prophet, the new dispensation of religion, wherein all ceremonial observances were to be abolished, and nothing but repentance, partly flowing from, and partly followed by, faith in the Messiah, and producing sincere obedience, would avail toward the pardon of sin, acceptance with God, and the enjoyment of eternal life. According to Luke, the argument whereby John enforced his exhortations to repentance was, that sinners would thereby obtain the remission of their sins. The two evangelists, therefore, being compared, show, that the great and distinguishing privilege of the new dispensation is, that therein pardon is promised to, and conferred on, penitents who believe in Jesus, and that the kingdom of God, including <span class="ital">righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>,) is set up in their hearts and governs their lives. <span class="ital">Every valley shall be filled, </span>&c. — Of these metaphors, which are plainly taken from the making of roads, the meaning is, that the Messiah’s forerunner, by preaching the doctrine of repentance, and thereby affecting men’s minds with remorse and shame for their past conduct, and producing amendment of life, should be instrumental in effecting such a change in the hearts and lives of the Jews, that many of them should acknowledge, receive, and become subject to the Messiah, when he appeared. <span class="ital">And all flesh shall see the salvation of God </span>— After such a preparation of the way as is now described, mankind shall behold, not a splendid temporal monarch, accompanied with a magnificent retinue, but the author of that salvation <span class="ital">which God has prepared before the face of all people. </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/2-30.htm" title="For my eyes have seen your salvation,...">Luke 2:30-31</a>; see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-3.htm" title="For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.">Matthew 3:3</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-14 The scope and design of John's ministry were, to bring the people from their sins, and to their Saviour. He came preaching, not a sect, or party, but a profession; the sign or ceremony was washing with water. By the words here used John preached the necessity of repentance, in order to the remission of sins, and that the baptism of water was an outward sign of that inward cleansing and renewal of heart, which attend, or are the effects of true repentance, as well as a profession of it. Here is the fulfilling of the Scriptures, Isa 40:3, in the ministry of John. When way is made for the gospel into the heart, by taking down high thoughts, and bringing them into obedience to Christ, by levelling the soul, and removing all that hinders us in the way of Christ and his grace, then preparation is made to welcome the salvation of God. Here are general warnings and exhortations which John gave. The guilty, corrupted race of mankind is become a generation of vipers; hateful to God, and hating one another. There is no way of fleeing from the wrath to come, but by repentance; and by the change of our way the change of our mind must be shown. If we are not really holy, both in heart and life, our profession of religion and relation to God and his church, will stand us in no stead at all; the sorer will our destruction be, if we do not bring forth fruits meet for repentance. John the Baptist gave instructions to several sorts of persons. Those that profess and promise repentance, must show it by reformation, according to their places and conditions. The gospel requires mercy, not sacrifice; and its design is, to engage us to do all the good we can, and to be just to all men. And the same principle which leads men to forego unjust gain, leads to restore that which is gained by wrong. John tells the soldiers their duty. Men should be cautioned against the temptations of their employments. These answers declared the present duty of the inquirers, and at once formed a test of their sincerity. As none can or will accept Christ's salvation without true repentance, so the evidence and effects of this repentance are here marked out.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the baptism of John - see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3.htm">Matthew 3</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

All that we have of John’s ministry is to be found either in this chapter, or in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/3-1.htm" title="In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,...">Matthew 3:1-17</a></span>, or in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/1-1.htm" title="The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;...">Mark 1:1-45</a></span>, or in the <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....">John 1:1-51</a> 3:1-36</span>. From them all it appeareth, that the sum of his doctrine was, the necessity of repentance, and faith in Christ, in order to the remission of sins. His pressing faith in Christ is most clearly declared by the evangelist John. Matthew, Mark, and Luke insist more upon his preaching the <span class="ital">doctrine of repentance for the remission of sins</span>, and baptism as an evidence of it. Which doctrine or repentance he pressed both from evangelical motives, <span class="ital">The kingdom of heaven is at hand, </span> and from legal motives, or arguments of terror, <span class="ital">The axe is now laid unto the root of the trees:</span> in this setting an example to all ministers of the gospel, showing them what should be the main subjects of their discourses, for we shall find that our Saviour preached the same doctrine, and in the same method.

The Jews had been familiar with the symbolism of baptism from the earliest days, as a consecration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-4.htm" title="And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water.">Exodus 29:4</a>), and a purification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-8.htm" title="And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.">Leviticus 14:8</a>). It was one of the forms by which proselytes were admitted into Judaism. John’s adoption of this rite proved (i) his authority (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a>); and (ii) his opinion that even Jews needed to be thus washed from sins.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-3.htm" title="And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;">Luke 3:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰορδάνου</span>, <span class="ital">Jordan</span>) a river suited for baptizing in.

The reputation of John probably preceded the Divine summons. His family - the son of a well-known priestly family - the marvellous circumstances attendant on his birth, his ascetic manner of life from the beginning, - all this had contributed to make him a marked personage; so, when he left his solitude, we read in the other evangelists how multitudes came forth to hear the strange burning words, the Divine eloquence of one long looked upon by the people as set apart for a great work. He seems to have principally preached and taught in the Jordan valley - no doubt for the convenience of his candidates for baptism. But he evidently did not confine his preaching to one spot or even to one neighborhood. The district here alluded to was about a hundred and fifty miles in length. The expectation of Messiah for centuries had been the root of all true life in Israel; gradually, as the clouds of evil fortune gathered thick over the people, the figure of the coming Messiah assumed a different aspect. At first a <span class="accented">holier Monarch</span> than their loved David, a <span class="accented">grander Sovereign</span> and a mightier than the Solomon of whom they were so proud, a <span class="accented">King</span> whose dominions should be broader far than even the wide realm ruled over by the son of Jesse and his greater son, was the ideal dreamed of by the Hebrew. In the long period of misfortune which succeeded the golden days of the monarchy, the people at first longed for a <span class="accented">deliverer</span>, and then - as never a ray of sunlight pierced the clouds which surrounded them - an <span class="accented">avenger</span> took the place of a deliverer. The Messiah of the future must be One who should restore his people certainly, but in the restoration must exact a sharp and severe reckoning from those who had so long oppressed his Israel. They had no conception of their true state, - their hypocrisy, their formalism, their total ignorance of all true spiritual religion. Their higher and cultured classes were selfish, grasping, impure, untrue. The mass of the people were ignorant and degraded, cruel fanatics, excited and untutored, zealots. From this mistaken notion of Messiah and his work it was necessary that a prophet, eminent and gifted like those mighty men who had wrought great things in times past among the people, should arise among them, and with strong, powerful, inspired words convince them of their fatal error - one who, in the language of the greatest of the order, should <span class="accented">prepare the way of the Lord</span>. How imperatively necessary, for the work of the Redeemer, this work of the pioneer was, is seen from the extreme difficulty which Jesus Christ himself found in persuading even his own little faithful band to realize anything of the nature of his work; in good truth they never, not even the noblest spirits among them, really grasped the secret of their Master's mission till the cross and the Passion belonged to history, and the Crucified had become the Risen, and the Risen the ascended God. <span class="cmt_word">The baptism of repentance</span>. What, first, did John mean by repentance? The word translates the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which signifies "change of mind." In the Gospel of St. Matthew, where John's work is told in slightly different language, he is represented as saying, "Repent ye" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). There his words might be paraphrased, "Turn ye from your old thoughts, from your state of self-content, self-satisfaction; mend your ways; reform." Here, then, the baptism (what that signified we shall discuss presently) which he preached and summoned men to, must be accompanied with a change of mind; the baptized must be no longer content with their present state or conduct; they must change their ways and reform their lives. Let them, those who were convinced that he was indeed a man of God, that his words were right and true - let them come to him, determined to change their conduct in life, and receive from his hands a baptism, a washing <span class="accented">- the symbol of the means of purification</span>;  for John's baptism was nothing more. Now, baptism, it is clear, was not at this time practiced among the Jews. It was not, as far as we can trace, even used in the case of pagan proselytes to Judaism. This apparently only became a national custom after the fall of Jerusalem, A.D. 70, forty years later. His very title, "the Baptist," in some way shows us that he practiced an unusual, if not a novel, rite in the course of his preaching and teaching. John's baptism (to use Dr. Morrison's vivid expressions, Commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-6.htm">Matthew 3:6</a>) was just the embodiment, in significant <span class="accented">optical</span> symbolism, of the significant audible symbolism of the Old Testament prophets, when they cried aloud and said, "Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16</a>); "In float day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13.htm">Zechariah 13</a>:l); "Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you. and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25, 26</a>). This view of John's baptism, viz. that it was a symbol, and nothing more, was suggested by Josephus writing for the Jews. "John," he says, "enjoined upon the Jews first to cultivate virtue and to put in practice righteousness toward one another, and piety toward God, and then to come to his baptism, for thus only would the baptism be acceptable to God" ('Ant.,' 18:05, 2). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The country about Jordan<p>Which both Matthew and Mark call the wilderness.
