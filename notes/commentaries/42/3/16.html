He could only exhort them to repent, and assure them of forgiveness upon repentance; but he could not work repentance in them, nor confer remission on them. Thus highly does it become us to speak of Christ, and thus humbly of ourselves. John can do no more than baptize with water, in token that they ought to purify and cleanse themselves; but Christ can, and will baptize with the Holy Ghost; he can give the Spirit, to cleanse and purify the heart, not only as water washes off the dirt on the outside, but as fire clears out the dross that is within, and melts down the metal, that it may be cast into a new mould. John was an affectionate preacher; he was beseeching; he pressed things home upon his hearers. He was a practical preacher; quickening them to their duty, and directing them in it. He was a popular preacher; he addressed the people, according to their capacity. He was an evangelical preacher. In all his exhortations, he directed people to Christ. When we press duty upon people, we must direct them to Christ, both for righteousness and strength. He was a copious preacher; he shunned not to declare the whole counsel of God. But a full stop was put to John's preaching when he was in the midst of his usefulness. Herod being reproved by him for many evils, shut up John in prison. Those who injure the faithful servants of God, add still greater guilt to their other sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11-12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

The preposition <span class="bld"><span class="ital">en</span></span> distinguishes between the mere <span class="ital">instrumentality</span> of the water, and the <span class="ital">spiritual element</span> whereby and wherein the child of the kingdom is baptized. This baptism by the Spirit had been foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm" title="For I will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods on the dry ground: I will pour my spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring:">Isaiah 44:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>.

But it is fulfilled without visible supernatural signs to all Christians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1 Corinthians 6:11</a>; “by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and with fire</span>] In its first and most literal sense the allusion is to the fiery tongues of Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-3.htm" title="And there appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat on each of them.">Acts 2:3</a>); but the secondary and metaphoric allusion is to the burning zeal and illuminating light of the Spirit.

Yet nevertheless it is not here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a>, where material water is meant; for in this passage material fire is not signified; since in John the water is named before the mention of the Spirit, whereas here the Spirit and fire are named together. In respect to the impenitent the fire denotes the fire of wrath spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-17.htm" title="Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.">Luke 3:17</a>. In a similar manner fire has a double signification in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-49.htm" title="For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.">Mark 9:49</a>, compared with the preceding verses.[35]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[35] “Every one shall be salted with <span class="ital">fire</span>:” believers with the purifactory fire of trials, unbelievers with the fire that “is not quenched.”—ED. and TRANSL.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I cometh.</span> To refute this growing conviction that he was the Messiah, John tells the people plainly tidal Another far greater than he was coming. He, John, certainly washed (baptized) those who came to him, but his washing was merely symbolical - <span class="accented">it</span> could not purify them; his work had been to stir them up to repentance, to arouse them to change their lives. But the One who was coming, before whom he (John) was unworthy to stand and perform the humblest menial office, that great One should baptize too, but his baptism would be a very different thing. <span class="cmt_word">He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost</span>. There was, indeed, a difference between John's baptism and the baptism of the Messiah who was to come after him. John could do no more with his words and symbol baptism than rouse the people to struggle after repentance and a change of heart and life, while Messiah would furnish to men the influence from above, that was really needed in order to purity of heart and life. He would procure and pour out the influence of the Divine Spirit (see Dr. Morrison, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-8.htm">Mark 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And with fire</span>. Not with <span class="accented">punitive</span> fire, which interpretation would be quite alien from the context here. Those expositors who have adopted this meaning of the fire here have been most likely influenced by the mention of the unquenchable fire in the next sentence. The fire which was to enter into Messiah's baptism was rather <span class="accented">the flame of purification</span>. So we read of the coal of fire taken from off the  altar and laid on the mouth of Isaiah the prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6, 7</a>). "With fire," writes Bishop Wordsworth, "to purify, illumine, transform, inflame with holy fervor and zeal, and carry upward, as Elijah was carried up to heaven in a chariot of fire." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>One mightier (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>The definite article points to an expected personage.
