Cainan must therefore have been introduced here from the translation of the Seventy interpreters, who have inserted him in both these places in the same order as we find him here; and as this translation was then commonly used, and was more generally understood than the Hebrew, it is probable that some transcriber of this gospel added Cainan from that version. Unless we suppose that Luke himself might choose, in writing this genealogy, to follow the LXX., as he appears to do in several other passages that he has quoted from the Old Testament.” The evangelist’s design was only to present us with the genealogy of Christ in its ascent to Adam, and this is equally clear, whether we reckon Salah as the immediate descendant of Arphaxad, or whether we consider him as his grandson by Cainan. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:23-38 Matthew's list of the forefathers of Jesus showed that Christ was the son of Abraham, in whom all the families of the earth are blessed, and heir to the throne of David; but Luke shows that Jesus was the Seed of the woman that should break the serpent's head, and traces the line up to Adam, beginning with Eli, or Heli, the father, not of Joseph, but of Mary. The seeming differences between the two evangelists in these lists of names have been removed by learned men. But our salvation does not depend upon our being able to solve these difficulties, nor is the Divine authority of the Gospels at all weakened by them. The list of names ends thus, Who was the son of Adam, the son of God; that is, the offspring of God by creation. Christ was both the son of Adam and the Son of God, that he might be a proper Mediator between God and the sons of Adam, and might bring the sons of Adam to be, through him, the sons of God. All flesh, as descended from the first Adam, is as grass, and withers as the flower of the field; but he who partakes of the Holy Spirit of life from the Second Adam, has that eternal happiness, which by the gospel is preached unto us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See, on this genealogy, the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-30. son of Matthat, &c.&#8212;(See on [1563]Mt 1:13-15).

See Bertheau on 1 Chron. p. 6.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The genealogy in Luke</span>, who, moreover, in accordance with his Pauline universalism carries on the genealogical line up to Adam, is appropriately inserted <span class="ital">at this point</span>, just where the Messianic consecration of Jesus and the commencement therewith made of His ministry are related. Hence, also, the genealogy is given in an <span class="ital">ascending</span> line, as Luke did not intend, like Matthew, to begin his Gospel just at the birth of Jesus, but went much further back and started with the conception and birth of the Baptist; so in Luke the proper and, in so far as the historical connection was concerned, the right place for the genealogy could not have been, as in Matthew, at the beginning of the Gospel. Comp. Köstlin, p. 306.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In its contents the genealogy is extremely different from that in Matthew, since from Joseph to David, Luke has <span class="ital">far more</span> and <span class="ital">almost throughout different</span> links in the genealogy; since Matthew gives the line of Solomon, while Luke gives that of Nathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-14.htm" title="And these be the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,">2 Samuel 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>), although he introduces into it from the former <span class="greekheb">Σαλαθιήλ</span> and <span class="greekheb">Ζοροβάβελ</span>. Seeking in several ways to get rid of this last-mentioned difficulty (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-27.htm" title="Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel, which was the son of Neri,">Luke 3:27</a>), many have assumed <span class="ital">that Matthew gives the genealogy of Joseph, while Luke gives that of Mary</span>. To reconcile this with the text, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Ἡλί</span> has been taken to mean: <span class="ital">the son-in-law of Eli</span>, as, following many older commentators (Luther, also Chemnitz, Calovius, Bengel), Paulus, Olshausen, Krabbe, Ebrard, Riggenbach, Bisping, and others will have it; but this, according to the analogy of the rest of the links in the chain, is quite impossible. The attempt has been made to connect with this the hypothesis of Epiphanius, Grotius, Michaelis, and others, that Mary was an <span class="ital">heiress</span>, whose husband must therefore have belonged to the same family, and must have had his name inscribed in their family register (Michaelis, Olshausen); but this hypothesis itself, while it is equally objectionable in being arbitrary, and in going too far in its application, leaves the question altogether unsolved whether the law of the heiress was still in force at that time (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-17.htm" title="So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.">Matthew 1:17</a>, Rem. 2), even apart from the fact that Mary’s Davidic descent is wholly without proof, and extremely doubtful. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-36.htm" title="And, behold, your cousin Elisabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.">Luke 1:36</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-4.htm" title="And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)">Luke 2:4</a>. Another evasion, with a view to the appropriation of the genealogy to <span class="ital">Mary</span>, as well as that of Wieseler, is already refuted[79] at <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-23.htm" title="And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,">Luke 3:23</a>. See also Bleek, <span class="ital">Beitr</span>. p. 101 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hence the conclusion must be maintained, <span class="ital">that Luke also gives the genealogy of Joseph</span>. But if this be so, how are we to reconcile the genealogy with that given in Matthew? It has been supposed that Joseph was <span class="ital">adopted</span> (Augustine, <span class="ital">de consens. evangel</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-3.htm" title="And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.">Luke 2:3</a>; Wetstein, Schegg), or more usually, that he sprang from a <span class="ital">levirate marriage</span> (Julius Africanus in Eusebius, <span class="ital">H. E.</span> i. 7), so that Matthew adduces his natural father Jacob, while Luke adduces his legal father Eli (Julius Africanus, Theophylact, Euthymius Zigabenus, Augustine), or <span class="ital">vice versâ</span> (Ambrosius, Grotius, Wetstein, Schleiermacher). But what a complication this hypothesis, in itself quite arbitrary, involves! In this way Eli and Jacob must be taken to be mere <span class="ital">half-brothers</span>, because they have different fathers and forefathers! So in respect of Salathiel’s mother, we must once more call in the help of a levirate marriage, and represent Neri and Jechonia as in like manner half-brothers! In addition to this, the obligation to the levirate marriage for the half-brother is not authenticated, and the importing of the natural father into the legal genealogy was illegal; finally, we may make the general remark, that neither Matthew nor Luke adds any observation at all in citing the name of Joseph’s father, to call attention to any other than the ordinary physical paternal relationship. No; the reconciliation of the two genealogical registers, although they both refer to Joseph, is impossible; but it is very natural and intelligible that, as is usual in the case of great men, whose descent in its individual steps is obscure, no anxiety was felt to investigate his ancestry until long after the death of Jesus—until the living presence of his great manifestation and ministry no longer threw into the shade this matter of subordinate interest. The genealogical industry of the Jewish Christians had collected from tradition and from written documents several registers, which, appearing independently of one another, must have given very different results, as far back as David, in consequence of the obscurity of Joseph’s genealogy. The first evangelist adopted a genealogy in accordance with the David-Solomon line; but Luke adopted a totally different one, following the David-Nathan line.[80] But that Luke, as a matter of fact, rejected the genealogy of Matthew, is according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-3.htm" title="It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you in order, most excellent Theophilus,">Luke 1:3</a> to be regarded as a result of his later inquiries, as in general the great and irreconcilable divergence of his preliminary history from that of Matthew suggests the same conclusion. Only the motives of his decision are so completely unknown to us, that to concede to his genealogy the preference (v. Ammon, <span class="ital">L. J</span>. I. p. 179) remains unsafe, although the derivation of the Davidic descent of Jesus from the <span class="ital">Nathan</span> (therefore not the royal) line presupposes an investigation, in consequence of which the derivation of that descent through <span class="ital">Solomon</span>, which doubtless had <span class="ital">first</span> presented itself, was abandoned in the interest of <span class="ital">rectification</span> (according to Köstlin, indeed, in the <span class="ital">Ebionitic</span> interest, in opposition to the royal line stained with crime, and in opposition to worldly royalty in general).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As the genealogy in Matthew is arranged in accordance with a significant <span class="ital">numerical relation</span> (three times fourteen), a similar relation is also recognisable in the genealogy by Luke (eleven times seven), even although no express reference is made to it. See already Basil. M. III. p. 399 C.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[79] That Eli was the father of <span class="ital">Mary</span> is also inferred by Delitzsch on Hebr. p. 290, who suggests that after the premature death of his father Jacob, Joseph was adopted, namely, by this Eli as his foster son, and brought up along with Mary; that thus, therefore, Eli was Joseph’s <span class="ital">foster</span> father, but Mary’s <span class="ital">actual</span> father. What groundless devices! And yet the passage itself is “as simple as possible until we want to force it to say what it does not say,” Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 112.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[80] This variation in the Davidic descent of the Messiah occurs also in the later Jewish theology. See Delitzsch in the <span class="ital">Zeitschr. f. Luth. Theol</span>. 1860, 3, p. 460 f.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-36.htm" title="Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad, which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech,">Luke 3:36</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τοῦ Καϊνὰν</span>, <span class="ital">Kainan</span>) Let some, as best they can, furnish out a plausible array of some MSS. which are without the name <span class="ital">Cainan</span>: one is without it, viz. <span class="ital">Cantabrigiensis</span>, called also <span class="ital">Stephani</span> <span class="greekheb">β</span>, and also <span class="ital">codex Bezæ</span> [[37]]; which, as being a MS. containing the Latin as well as the Greek, deserves the title, not so much of a codex, as of a rhapsody comprising various readings of fathers.[38] “Even supposing that in countless copies of the New and Old Testaments,” as Voss rightly remarks, “the name of this Cainan were wanting, which however is not the case, yet no argument could be derived from that circumstance. For the reason of the omission would be evident from the fact that the Church approved of and followed the calculation of Africanus and Eusebius; and therefore I wonder that more copies are not found, in which the name of Cainan is expunged.”—c. Horn., p. 13. Nevertheless so many in our time disapprove of the <span class="ital">Cainan</span> here, that there is a risk of its being ere long thrust out from Luke; a judgment which betrays <span class="ital">great rashness</span>, as Rich. Simon on this passage properly remarks, and so also Gomarus. Besides Cainan is retained in Luke by J. E. Grabius, John Hardouin, Jac. Hasæus, G. C. Hosmann, to whom are to be added thes. phil. p. 174 of Hottinger, Glassius, etc. Among the ancients is <span class="ital">Ambrose</span>, who, on Luke 7, says, “The Lord was born of Mary in the seventy-seventh generation.” That this Cainan was mentioned in the LXX. Version made before the nativity of Christ (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-24.htm" title="And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.">Genesis 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-12.htm" title="And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:">Genesis 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-18.htm" title="And Arphaxad begat Shelah, and Shelah begat Eber.">1 Chronicles 1:18</a>, [in which passages Cainan’s name is passed over]) the Chronicon of Demetrius in Eusebius, B. ix. præp. Ev. page 425, proves. Moreover many documents attest that Theophilus, to whom Luke wrote, was at Alexandria. There is no doubt but that ‘Cainan’ was read at least in the LXX. version at Alexandria, that I may not say that it was in that city the insertion of his name took place. Wherefore it was not suitable that ‘Cainan’ should already at that early time [the first sending of the Gospel to Alexandria] be either omitted by Luke or marked openly with the brand of spuriousness. Elsewhere also Luke made that concession to the Hellenistic Jews, that he followed the LXX. translators in preference to the Hebrew text. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-14.htm" title="Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, three score and fifteen souls.">Acts 7:14</a>. And so here he did not expunge ‘Cainan,’ whose name was inserted in their version. And yet he did not thereby do any violence to truth; for the fact of the descent of Jesus Christ from David, though some fathers have been passed over in Matthew, and similarly on the other hand Cainan has been retained in Luke, still remains uninjured. Nay, even he took precaution for the exactness of the main truth by that prefatory observation, <span class="ital">as was accounted</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-23.htm" title="And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,">Luke 3:23</a>, where see the note. In fine, it is not the province of those who discuss the New Testament to warrant the infallible accuracy of readings of the LXX. translators. In the chronology the question concerning Cainan is of especial moment. Therefore we have said something concerning that person in the <span class="ital">Ordo Temporum</span>, p. 52 (Ed. ii., p. 44, 45), Lightfoot read Cainan in the Accusative form (‘Cainanem’).[39]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[37] Bezæ, or Cantabrig.: Univ. libr., Cambridge: fifth cent.: publ. by Kipling, 1793: Gospels, Acts, and some Epp. def.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[38] A very unjust judgment.
