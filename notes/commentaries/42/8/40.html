There is no relief for souls under a sense of guilt, and fear of wrath, but to go to Christ, and call him Master, and say, I am undone, if thou dost not help me. When our dangers are over, it becomes us to take to ourselves the shame of our own fears, and to give Christ the glory of our deliverance. We may learn much out of this history concerning the world of infernal, malignant spirits, which though not working now exactly in the same way as then, yet all must at all times carefully guard against. And these malignant spirits are very numerous. They have enmity to man and all his comforts. Those under Christ's government are sweetly led with the bands of love; those under the devil's government are furiously driven. Oh what a comfort it is to the believer, that all the powers of darkness are under the control of the Lord Jesus! It is a miracle of mercy, if those whom Satan possesses, are not brought to destruction and eternal ruin. Christ will not stay with those who slight him; perhaps he may no more return to them, while others are waiting for him, and glad to receive him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18-26</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-21.htm">Mark 5:21-43</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 8:40-56.

There cannot remain even a <span class="ital">shadow of uncertainty</span> as to how the matter is to be regarded (Weizsäcker). Jesus Himself will not leave the crowd in any doubt, but declares (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-52.htm" title="This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.">Luke 23:52</a>) in His pregnant style what must immediately of itself be evident.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-40.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.">Luke 8:40</a>. <span class="ital">On the western side</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-21.htm" title="And when Jesus was passed over again by ship to the other side, much people gathered to him: and he was near to the sea.">Mark 5:21</a>). Lk. still follows Mk. closely, mentioning the cordial welcome given Jesus on His arrival on the Galilean shore, and proceeding to narrate the incidents of the woman with a flux, and Jairus’ daughter.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ ὄχλος</span>, the crowd. This crowd is unexplained by Lk., who says nothing of a crowd when he introduces his narrative of the voyage to the eastern shore (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-22.htm" title="Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.">Luke 8:22</a>). In Mk. the presence of a crowd is easily accounted for: Jesus had suddenly left the great congregation to which He had spoken in parables, and as His stay on the eastern side was cut short, when He returned to the western shore the crowd had hardly dispersed, or at least could reassemble on short notice. Mk. does not say <span class="ital">the</span> crowd, but a great crowd.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπεδέξατο</span> implies a cordial reception. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-4.htm" title="And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.">Acts 15:4</a>. Raphel gives examples of this sense from Greek authors. Euthy. took it in this sense, giving as the reason for the welcome: <span class="greekheb">ὡς εὐεργέτην καὶ σωτῆρα</span>.—<span class="greekheb">προσδοκῶντες</span>: the parables, not to speak of recent healings, account for the expectation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">40.

He would naturally sail to Bethsaida or Capernaum. It is impossible here to enter into the uncertain question as to the exact order of events.

Allusion has already been made, in the notes which preceded the parable of the sower, to the enthusiasm for Jesus in the Galilee lake-cities and their neighbourhood. This, as the Master well knew, was only a temporary religious revival, but still while it lasted it gathered great crowds in every place where he visited. He had not been long in the Gadarene district, but his return was eagerly looked for in Galilee. This verse describes his reception on his return by the people, and introduces the recital of two famous miracles which he worked in this period of his ministry after his brief visit to the other shore of the lake. St. Matthew, before speaking of the request of Jairus that the Master would visit his dying child, relates the healing of the paralytic at Capernaum, and the calling of Matthew the apostle. It is scarcely possible now to arrange the events related, in their proper chronological order. The Gospel histories pretty faithfully represent the teaching of the first days, in which it was evidently the practice of apostles and apostolic men to group their accounts of particular incidents in the Lord's life with a view to teaching certain lessons connected with doctrine or with daily living, often disregarding the order in which these incidents really happened. Hence so many of the differences in detail in our Gospels. </body></html>
