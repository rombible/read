And many a poor soul is healed, and helped, and saved by Christ, that is hidden in a crowd, and nobody notices it. This woman came trembling, yet her faith saved her. There may be trembling, where yet there is saving faith. Observe Christ's comfortable words to Jairus, Fear not, believe only, and thy daughter shall be made whole. No less hard was it not to grieve for the loss of an only child, than not to fear the continuance of that grief. But in perfect faith there is no fear; the more we fear, the less we believe. The hand of Christ's grace goes with the calls of his word, to make them effectual. Christ commanded to give her meat. As babes new born, so those newly raised from sin, desire spiritual food, that they may grow thereby.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18-26</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-21.htm">Mark 5:21-43</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 8:40-56.

At that feast arose the question about fasting, and St Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm" title="While he spoke these things to them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay your hand on her, and she shall live.">Matthew 9:18</a>) says that Jairus came “while Jesus was yet speaking these things,” and in so definite a note of time, on a day to him so memorable, he could hardly be inexact. On the other hand, St Mark says, and St Luke implies, that the message reached Jesus as He disembarked on the sea-shore. Hence it has been supposed that Jesus heard the first entreaty from Jairus on the shore when his daughter was dying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-42.htm" title="For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.">Luke 8:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-23.htm" title="And sought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death: I pray you, come and lay your hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.">Mark 5:23</a>), but instead of going straight to the house of Jairus went first to Matthew’s feast; and that Jairus then came to the feast in agony to say that she was just dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm" title="While he spoke these things to them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay your hand on her, and she shall live.">Matthew 9:18</a>). The very small discrepancies are however quite easily explicable -without this conjecture, and it was wholly unlike the method of Jesus to interpose a feast between the request of an agonised father and His act of mercy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jairus</span>] Jair, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-3.htm" title="And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years.">Jdg 10:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a ruler of the synagogue</span>] The synagogues had no clergy, but were managed by laymen, at the head of whom was the “ruler,” whose title of <span class="ital">Rosh hakkeneseth</span> was as familiar to the Jews as that of Rabbi.

The public request, made too with intense earnestness, of one holding such a position, is a clear proof that the Galilee enthusiasm for Jesus was by no means confined to the poorer part of the population, or even to the more careless and thoughtless; such a man as Jairus is a fair representative of the well-to-do, perhaps wealthy, orthodox Jew; strict and rigid in his ritual observances, and held in high honour by his fellow Jewish citizens.
