Happy are we, and for ever indebted to free grace, if the same thing that is a parable to others, with which they are only amused, is a plain truth to us, by which we are taught and governed. We ought to take heed of the things that will hinder our profiting by the word we hear; to take heed lest we hear carelessly and slightly, lest we entertain prejudices against the word we hear; and to take heed to our spirits after we have heard the word, lest we lose what we have gained. The gifts we have, will be continued to us or not, as we use them for the glory of God, and the good of our brethren. Nor is it enough not to hold the truth in unrighteousness; we should desire to hold forth the word of life, and to shine, giving light to all around. Great encouragement is given to those who prove themselves faithful hearers of the word, by being doers of the work.

The Syriac version reads, "on good and beautiful ground"; and so the Cambridge copy of Beza's; ground which both looked well, and proved well; and signifies such hearers who have good and honest hearts, made so by the Spirit of God; who receive the word in the love of it, have a spiritual understanding, and real experience of it; <p>and sprang up, and bare fruit, an hundred fold; or, "a hundred for one", as the Syriac version renders it; a hundred grains for one that was sown. The Ethiopic version adds, "and it was to thirty, and it was to sixty": that is, as the other evangelists say, "some thirty", and "some sixty fold"; for the word of God is more fruitful in some of those gracious hearers, than in others: <p>and when he had said these things, he cried: with a loud voice, that what he was about to say might be attended to: <p>he that hath ears to hear, let him hear; see this parable more largely explained in the following notes.

Lk. has only one degree of fruitfulness, the highest, possibly because when 100 is possible 60 and 30 were deemed unsatisfactory, but an important lesson is missed by the omission. The version in Mt. and Mk. is doubtless the original. It was characteristic of Jesus, while demanding the undivided heart, to allow for diversity in the measure of fruitfulness. Therein appeared His “sweet reasonableness”. This omission seems to justify the opinion of Meyer that Lk.’s version of the parable is secondary.

This is by no means an unheard-of increase even in the West, where vegetation is less luxuriant. Herodotus, quoted by Trench ('Parables'), mentions that two hundredfold was a common return in the Plain of Babylon, and sometimes three hundredfold; and Niebuhr mentions a species of maize that returns four hundredfold. On the marvellous fruit-bearing which would take place in the days of the Lord's future kingdom on earth, Irenaeus gives a quotation from Papias, who gave it on the authority of those who had heard St. John speak of the teaching of the Lord to that effect. Professor Westcott ('Introduction to the Study of the Gospels,' Appendix C, 21) thinks that the tradition was based on the real discourses of the Lord. It is, of course, allegorical, for is it not a memory cf. a conversation between Jesus and his disciples arising out of this parable of the sower? "The Lord taught of those days (of his future kingdom on earth) and said, The <span class="accented">days will come in which vines shall spring up</span>, <span class="accented">each having</span>, <span class="accented">ten thousand stocks</span>, <span class="accented">and on each stock ten thousand branches</span>, <span class="accented">and on each branch ten thousand shoots</span>, <span class="accented">and on each shoot ten thousand bunches</span>, <span class="accented">and on each bunch ten thousand grapes</span>, <span class="accented">and each grape when pressed shalt give five and twenty measures of wine.

And when Judas the traitor believed not, and asked - How, then, shall such productions proceed from the Lord? the Lord said, <span class="accented">They shall see who come to those times"</span> (Papias; see Irenaeus, 5:33. 3). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A hundred-fold.<p>Omitting the thirty and sixty of Matthew and Mark.
