And many a poor soul is healed, and helped, and saved by Christ, that is hidden in a crowd, and nobody notices it. This woman came trembling, yet her faith saved her. There may be trembling, where yet there is saving faith. Observe Christ's comfortable words to Jairus, Fear not, believe only, and thy daughter shall be made whole. No less hard was it not to grieve for the loss of an only child, than not to fear the continuance of that grief. But in perfect faith there is no fear; the more we fear, the less we believe. The hand of Christ's grace goes with the calls of his word, to make them effectual. Christ commanded to give her meat. As babes new born, so those newly raised from sin, desire spiritual food, that they may grow thereby.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18-26</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-21.htm">Mark 5:21-43</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 8:40-56.

By the Levitic law she had to be “put apart, and whosoever toucheth her shall be unclean” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm" title="And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the even.">Leviticus 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-25.htm" title="And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.">Leviticus 15:25</a>). The word translated “border” <span class="ital">(kraspedon, </span>Heb. <span class="ital">tsitsith)</span> is a tassel at each “wing” or corner of the <span class="ital">tallith </span>or mantle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-36.htm" title="And sought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.">Matthew 14:36</a>).

V. <span class="ital">ribband)</span> of blue, the colour of heaven, and so the type of revelation. The strict Jews to this day wear these tassels, though they are usually concealed. The Pharisees, to proclaim their orthodoxy, made them conspicuously large, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-5.htm" title="But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,">Matthew 23:5</a>.

(For full particulars of the Rabbinic rules about these tassels see an article by the present writer, in the <span class="ital">Expositor,</span> v. 219.) The quasi-sacredness of the tassels may have fostered her impulse to touch the one that hung in view.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Hem<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20</a>.<p>Stanched (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;)<p>A common medical term. </body></html>
