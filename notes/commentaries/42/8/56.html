And many a poor soul is healed, and helped, and saved by Christ, that is hidden in a crowd, and nobody notices it. This woman came trembling, yet her faith saved her. There may be trembling, where yet there is saving faith. Observe Christ's comfortable words to Jairus, Fear not, believe only, and thy daughter shall be made whole. No less hard was it not to grieve for the loss of an only child, than not to fear the continuance of that grief. But in perfect faith there is no fear; the more we fear, the less we believe. The hand of Christ's grace goes with the calls of his word, to make them effectual. Christ commanded to give her meat. As babes new born, so those newly raised from sin, desire spiritual food, that they may grow thereby.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18-26</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/5-21.htm">Mark 5:21-43</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>55. give her meat&#8212;(See on [1605]Mr 5:43).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-41.htm" title="And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and sought him that he would come into his house:">Luke 8:41</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And her parents were astonished,....

The Ethiopic version reads, "what he had done, nor any thing that was done" not that the thing itself could be concealed, but the way and manner in which, and the means by which it was done, and the circumstances of it; how that by taking her by the hand, and commanding her to arise, she forthwith arose, and walked and ate: Christ's meaning is, that he would not have them take any pains to publish this affair, or to make it more known than was necessary; not to acquaint any person with the particulars of it, but keep them as private as they could: his reasons for this; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-43.htm">Mark 5:43</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">56</span>. <span class="ital">that they should tell no man</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-14.htm" title="And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.">Luke 5:14</a>.
