On Mary's arrival, Elisabeth was conscious of the approach of her who was to be the mother of the great Redeemer. At the same time she was filled with the Holy Ghost, and under his influence declared that Mary and her expected child were most blessed and happy, as peculiarly honoured of and dear to the Most High God. Mary, animated by Elisabeth's address, and being also under the influence of the Holy Ghost, broke out into joy, admiration, and gratitude. She knew herself to be a sinner who needed a Saviour, and that she could no otherwise rejoice in God than as interested in his salvation through the promised Messiah. Those who see their need of Christ, and are desirous of righteousness and life in him, he fills with good things, with the best things; and they are abundantly satisfied with the blessings he gives. He will satisfy the desires of the poor in spirit who long for spiritual blessings, while the self-sufficient shall be sent empty away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Saluted Elizabeth - Expressed great joy and gratification at seeing her, and used the customary tokens of affectionate salutation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40. saluted Elisabeth&#8212;now returned from her seclusion (Lu 1:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-39.htm" title="And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;">Luke 1:39</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And entered into the house of Zacharias, &amp;c.
