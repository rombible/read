Christ must be born miraculously. The angel's address means only, Hail, thou that art the especially chosen and favoured of the Most High, to attain the honour Jewish mothers have so long desired. This wondrous salutation and appearance troubled Mary. The angel then assured her that she had found favour with God, and would become the mother of a son whose name she should call Jesus, the Son of the Highest, one in a nature and perfection with the Lord God. JESUS! the name that refreshes the fainting spirits of humbled sinners; sweet to speak and sweet to hear, Jesus, a Saviour! We know not his riches and our own poverty, therefore we run not to him; we perceive not that we are lost and perishing, therefore a Saviour is a word of little relish. Were we convinced of the huge mass of guilt that lies upon us, and the wrath that hangs over us for it, ready to fall upon us, it would be our continual thought, Is the Saviour mine? And that we might find him so, we should trample on all that hinders our way to him. Mary's reply to the angel was the language of faith and humble admiration, and she asked no sign for the confirming her faith. Without controversy, great was the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh, 1Ti 3:16. Christ's human nature must be produced so, as it was fit that should be which was to be taken into union with the Divine nature. And we must, as Mary here, guide our desires by the word of God. In all conflicts, let us remember that with God nothing is impossible; and as we read and hear his promises, let us turn them into prayers, Behold the willing servant of the Lord; let it be unto me according to thy word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy cousin Elizabeth ... - The case of Elizabeth is mentioned to inspire Mary with confidence, and to assure her that what was now promised would be fulfilled.

Nor needed we any Scripture to prove that nothing could be impossible to him who is the first Being, the first Cause, and the Fountain of all power, and to whom all things are subject. No considerate man will from hence conclude that things are possible to God which would derogate from the perfection of the Divine Being, and are imperfections in us; nor yet that any thing is possible to God the contrary to which he hath willed, but God can do whatsoever he can will. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And behold thy cousin Elisabeth,.... For though Elisabeth was of the daughters of Aaron, or of the tribe of Levi by her father's side, yet might be of the tribe of Judah by her mother's side, and so akin to Mary. The Persic version calls her "aunt by the mother's side": intermarriages between the two tribes of Levi and Judah were frequent; nor were they at all contrary to the intention of that law, that forbid the tribes to intermarry, which was to preserve the inheritance in each tribe, since the tribe of Levi had none at all. Though she might be called her cousin in a more general sense; it being usual with the Jews to call all of their own nation their kinsmen and kinswomen, according to the flesh: but the former sense seems more agreeable; and so Mary is directed to her own family, and to her own relations, and known friends, for a sign, by which her faith might be confirmed, in what the angel had said unto her; for if she found the one to be true, she might conclude the other was also; which is as follows: <p>she hath also conceived a son in her old age: though Mary asked no sign, yet one is given her, whereby she might know the truth of what was spoken: for if it should appear that Elisabeth had received strength to conceive, as was declared by the angel; and that a son, too, which he could not have known without a divine revelation; and that in her old age, which, was extraordinary and supernatural, she might assure herself, that the message brought to her was from God; and that she likewise, though a virgin, might conceive, and bear a son: the angel adds, as a further testimony of the truth of things, <p>and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. Elisabeth, was generally known to be barren, and was, by way of reproach, usually called so, but was now six months gone with child; so that it was a plain case, and out of question; the signs of her pregnancy were very apparent. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And, behold, thy <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> sixth month with her, who was called barren.</span><p>(k) Though Elisabeth was of the tribe of Levi, yet it was possible for her to be Mary's cousin: for whereas it was forbidden by the Law for maidens to be married to men of other tribes, there was an exception among the Levites, who could take for themselves wives out of any tribe: for the Levites had no portion allotted to them when the land was divided among the people.<p>(l) This is now the sixth month from the time when she conceived.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/luke/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-36.htm" title="And, behold, your cousin Elisabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.">Luke 1:36</a> f. Confirmation of the promise by the disclosure of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, which, in fact, was also a deviation from the order of nature (<span class="greekheb">ἐν γήρει</span>), and so far presented an analogy, although only in an inferior sense. “En domesticum tibi exemplum!” Grotius. After <span class="greekheb">ἰδοὺ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. an <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> was as little needed as an <span class="greekheb">εἰμί</span> at <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-38.htm" title="And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word.

It is to be observed (1) that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΠᾶΝ</span></span></span> do not belong to one another, but of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠᾶΝ ῬῆΜΑ</span></span></span> it is said: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἈΔΥΝΑΤΉΣΕΙ</span></span></span> (Fritzsche, <span class="ital">Diss.</span> II. <span class="ital">in</span> 2 Cor. p. 24 f.); further, (2) that the proposition is a <span class="ital">general</span> one; hence the <span class="ital">future</span>, which, however, is purposely chosen with a view to what was announced to Mary; see Dissen, <span class="ital">ad Dem. de Cor.</span> p. 369; (3) that there exists no reason for abandoning the purely Greek meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἀδυνατεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">to be unable</span> (Rettig in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1838, p. 210), any more than of <span class="greekheb">ῥῆμα</span>, <span class="ital">utterance</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-38.htm" title="And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to your word.

Hence the meaning is not: “<span class="ital">With God nothing is impossible</span>;” but rather: <span class="ital">not powerless</span> (but of success and efficacy) <span class="ital">shall any utterance on the part of God be</span>. So also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-14.htm" title="Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to you, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.">Genesis 18:14</a>. Comp.
