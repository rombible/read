On Mary's arrival, Elisabeth was conscious of the approach of her who was to be the mother of the great Redeemer. At the same time she was filled with the Holy Ghost, and under his influence declared that Mary and her expected child were most blessed and happy, as peculiarly honoured of and dear to the Most High God. Mary, animated by Elisabeth's address, and being also under the influence of the Holy Ghost, broke out into joy, admiration, and gratitude. She knew herself to be a sinner who needed a Saviour, and that she could no otherwise rejoice in God than as interested in his salvation through the promised Messiah. Those who see their need of Christ, and are desirous of righteousness and life in him, he fills with good things, with the best things; and they are abundantly satisfied with the blessings he gives. He will satisfy the desires of the poor in spirit who long for spiritual blessings, while the self-sufficient shall be sent empty away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He hath regarded the low estate of his handmaid - Literally, he has looked upon the low or humble condition of his handmaid. That is, notwithstanding her humble rank and poverty, he has shown her favor. And this example abundantly teaches what is elsewhere fully taught in the Bible, that God is not a respecter of persons; that he is not influenced, in conferring favors, by wealth, honor, or office, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11-12</a>.

It is therefore right to consider her as highly favored or happy; but this certainly does not warrant us to worship her or to pray to her. Abraham was blessed in being the father of the faithful; Paul in being the apostle to the Gentiles; Peter in first preaching the gospel to them; but who would think of worshipping or praying to Abraham, Paul, or Peter? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>47. my Saviour&#8212;Mary, poor heart, never dreamt, we see, of her own "immaculate conception"&#8212;in the offensive language of the Romanists&#8212;any more than of her own immaculate life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Our translators have here rightly translated tapeinwsin, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">low estate.</span> Mary doubtless doth not here commend her own humility, (as some papists would have it), but magnifies God for that he had respect to her who was of so mean and low a condition; for though she was of the family of David, yet that family had for many years been broken and afflicted, and she was now espoused to a carpenter, which spake her condition low and mean though descended from the royal family of David: and thus God usually magnifies himself; he chooseth David from the sheepfold to be king over Israel; he much delighteth to exalt such as are low; he chooseth <span class="ital">the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, the weak things of the world to confound the mighty, and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen; that no flesh should glory in his presence, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-27.htm" title="But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;...">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Henceforth</span> (saith Mary) <span class="bld">all generations shall call me blessed.</span> It is no mean favour of God, when God giveth us a name: in the world, and that not only in the present generation, but in succeeding generations. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden,.... Meaning, either her outward temporal estate, which was very low and mean: David's family was now very much reduced, it had its seat not at Jerusalem, but at Nazareth, in Galilee: Mary, of that house, was a poor virgin, and Joseph, of the same, to whom she was betrothed, was a poor carpenter; and yet God passed by the rich and noble families of Jewish people, and pitched upon this poor virgin to be the mother of the Messiah: or her estate, in a spiritual sense, which, as that of every son and daughter of Adam, was very low by the fall; for sin has run all mankind into debt, and they have nothing to pay: it has stripped them of original righteousness, and clothed them with rags; it has filled them with diseases, from the crown of the head to the sole of the feet; it has exposed them to a prison, into which being cast, they must lie, till they have paid the uttermost farthing; and has left them hopeless and helpless, poor and miserable, and blind and naked: but God has remembered his elect, in this their low estate, and has provided a Saviour for them, and sent him to deliver them out of it; because his mercy endures forever; and this Mary was sensible, and there rejoiced in God her Saviour: <p>for behold, from henceforth all generations; not Jews only, but Gentiles also, <p>shall call me blessed; both on account of her son she had now conceived, and was bearing; because she was the mother of our Lord, who had reason so to conclude, from the nature of the thing, and from the words of the angel, and of Elisabeth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-28.htm">Luke 1:28</a> and much more than Leah had, who said something like this, at the birth of her second son, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-13.htm">Genesis 30:13</a> and also on account of her interest in Christ, as God her Saviour: in whom she was blessed, with all spiritual blessings; so that she was truly blessed, and might well be called so. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he hath <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> regarded the <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</span><p>(q) Has freely and graciously loved.<p>(r) Literally, My baseness, that is, my base estate: so that the virgin did not boast of her deserts, but the grace of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-48.htm" title="For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from now on all generations shall call me blessed.">Luke 1:48</a>. This verse and the two preceding form the first of four strophes, into which the song naturally divides. The first strophe expresses simply the singer’s gladness. The second (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-49.htm" title="For he that is mighty has done to me great things; and holy is his name....">Luke 1:49-50</a>) states its cause. The third (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-51.htm" title="He has showed strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts....">Luke 1:51-53</a>) describes in gnomic aorists the moral order of the world, for the establishment of which God ever works in His holy and wise Providence, overturning the conventional order, scattering the proud, upsetting thrones, and exalting them of low degree, filling the hungry, and sending the rich away empty. It is this third part of the hymn which on first view seems least in keeping with the occasion. And yet on a large view this strophe exactly describes the constant tendency of Christ’s influence in the world: to turn things upside down, reverse judgments, and alter positions. The last strophe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-54.htm" title="He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;...">Luke 1:54-55</a>) sets forth the birth about to happen as a deed of divine grace to Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">48</span>. <span class="ital">he hath regarded</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">He looked upon</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the low estate</span>] So Hagar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-11.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to her, Behold, you are with child and shall bear a son, and shall call his name Ishmael; because the LORD has heard your affliction.">Genesis 16:11</a>) and Hannah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm" title="And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.">1 Samuel 1:11</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/138-6.htm" title="Though the LORD be high, yet has he respect to the lowly: but the proud he knows afar off.">Psalm 138:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-17.htm" title="He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.">Psalm 102:17</a>).
