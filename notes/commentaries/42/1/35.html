It gave a sufficient reason for the name which should be given to the Son of Mary, and more was not then required.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:26-38 We have here an account of the mother of our Lord; though we are not to pray to her, yet we ought to praise God for her. Christ must be born miraculously. The angel's address means only, Hail, thou that art the especially chosen and favoured of the Most High, to attain the honour Jewish mothers have so long desired. This wondrous salutation and appearance troubled Mary. The angel then assured her that she had found favour with God, and would become the mother of a son whose name she should call Jesus, the Son of the Highest, one in a nature and perfection with the Lord God. JESUS! the name that refreshes the fainting spirits of humbled sinners; sweet to speak and sweet to hear, Jesus, a Saviour! We know not his riches and our own poverty, therefore we run not to him; we perceive not that we are lost and perishing, therefore a Saviour is a word of little relish. Were we convinced of the huge mass of guilt that lies upon us, and the wrath that hangs over us for it, ready to fall upon us, it would be our continual thought, Is the Saviour mine? And that we might find him so, we should trample on all that hinders our way to him. Mary's reply to the angel was the language of faith and humble admiration, and she asked no sign for the confirming her faith. Without controversy, great was the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh, 1Ti 3:16. Christ's human nature must be produced so, as it was fit that should be which was to be taken into union with the Divine nature. And we must, as Mary here, guide our desires by the word of God. In all conflicts, let us remember that with God nothing is impossible; and as we read and hear his promises, let us turn them into prayers, Behold the willing servant of the Lord; let it be unto me according to thy word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>.<p>The power of the Highest ... - This evidently means that the body of Jesus would be created by the direct power of God.

We must neither think of a double Sonship, as some do, harshly and without all ground, nor deny what is here plainly expressed, the connection between His human birth and His proper personal Sonship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Holy Ghost</span> (who is also called here <span class="ital">the power of the Highest) shall come upon thee; </span> it is a phrase which signifieth a special and peculiar influence of the Holy Spirit: thus we read of the prophets, that the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-14.htm" title="Then on Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the middle of the congregation;">2 Chronicles 20:14</a></span>, &c., which argued a special influence of the Holy Spirit on them, efficacious, so as it put them upon a present prophesying. There is a common influence of God upon the forming of all children in the womb, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-8.htm" title="Your hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet you do destroy me.">Job 10:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-15.htm" title="My substance was not hid from you, when I was made in secret, and curiously worked in the lowest parts of the earth.">Psalm 139:15</a></span>. But this phrase denotes an extraordinary special influence of the Spirit, changing the order and course of nature, and giving a power to the blood of the virgin by him sanctified, to coagulate alone to the forming of the body of a child: this is more mysteriously yet expressed, by the term <span class="ital">overshadow thee, </span> which I take to be a modest phrase, signifying only a supply of man’s act, by a Divine creating power, in a most miraculous manner. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God, </span> as Adam was called the son of God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-38.htm" title="Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.">Luke 3:38</a></span>, God (by his creating power) supplying as to him the place of father and mother, and to Christ supplying the place of the father, though not of the mother, for (saith the angel) he shall be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">born of thee.</span> But yet that mass of flesh shall be a holy thing, because, though born of thee, and flesh of thy flesh, yet of thy flesh first sanctified, by the Holy Ghost coming upon and overshadowing of thee.

The angel gave her an account of the manner in which what he had said should be effected, as well as observed some things for the strengthening of her faith, <p>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee. The words, "upon thee", are left out in the Syriac and Persic versions; but are retained in others, and in all copies: the formation of Christ's human nature, though common to all the three persons, yet is particularly, and most properly ascribed to the Spirit; not to the first person, the Father, lest it should be thought that he is only the Father of him, as man; nor to the second person, the Son, since it is to him that the human nature is personally united; but to the third person, the Spirit, who is the sanctifier; and who separated, and sanctified it, the first moment of its conception, and preserved it from the taint of original sin. His coming upon the virgin must be understood in consistence with his omnipresence, and immensity; and cannot design any local motion, but an effectual operation in forming the human nature of her flesh and substance; and not in the ordinary manner in which he is concerned in the formation of all men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-4.htm">Job 33:4</a> but in an extraordinary way, not to be conceived of, and explained. The phrase most plainly answers to , in frequent use with the Jews (x), as expressive of coition, <p>And the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee. By "the power of the Highest" is not meant the Lord Jesus Christ, who is sometimes called the power of God; but rather the Holy Ghost, as before, who is styled the finger of God, and power from on high, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a> unless it should be thought that the perfection of divine power common to all the three persons is intended: and so points out the means by which the wondrous thing should be performed, even by the power of God; and which should not only be employed in forming the human nature of Christ, but in protecting the virgin from any suspicion and charge of sin, and defending her innocence and virtue, by moving upon Joseph to take her to wife. In the word, "overshadow", some think there is an allusion to the Spirit of God moving upon the face of the waters, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> when,  he brooded upon them, as the word may be rendered; and which is the sense of it, according to the Jewish writers (y) as a hen, or any other bird broods on its eggs to exclude its young: and others have thought the allusion may be to , (z), "the nuptial covering": which was a veil, or canopy, like a tent, supported on four staves, under which the bridegroom and bride were betrothed; or, as Dr. Lightfoot thinks, it is a modest phrase alluding to the conjugal embraces, signified by a man's spreading the skirt of his garment over the woman, which Ruth desired of Boaz, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a> though the Jewish writers say (a), that phrase is  expressive of the act of marriage, or taking to wife. The phrase of being   "overshadowed", or "covered with the spirit of prophecy", as the virgin also was, is used by the Targumist, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>. <p>therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. The human nature of Christ is here called a "thing"; for it was not a person; it never subsisted of itself, but was taken at once into union with the person of the Son of God, otherwise there would be two persons in Christ, whereas he is God, and man, in one person; and it is said to be "holy", being free from that original pollution and sin, in which all that descend from Adam, by ordinary generation, are conceived, and brought forth; and is, moreover, said to be born of a virgin, "of thee", or "out of thee". Christ's flesh was formed out of the Virgin's; he took flesh of her; his body did not descend from heaven, or pass through her, as water through a pipe, as some heretics of old said: nor did his human nature, either as to soul or body, pre-exist his incarnation; but in the fulness of time he was made of a woman, and took a true body of her, and a reasonable soul, into union with his divine person; and "therefore should be called the Son of God": not that he was now to become the "the Son of God"; he was so before his incarnation, and even from all eternity; but he was now to be manifested as such in human nature: nor does the angel predict, that he should, for this reason, be called the Son of God; for he never was, on this account, so called, either by himself, or others: nor is the particle, "therefore", causal, but consequential: the angel is not giving a reason why Christ should be the Son of God, but why he should be owned, and acknowledged, as such by his people: who would infer, and conclude from his wonderful conception and birth, that he is the "Emmanuel", God with us, the child that was to be born, and the Son given, whose name should be Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty God, &amp;c. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>. Moreover, the word, "also", is not to be overlooked; and the sense is, that seeing that human nature, which should be born of the virgin, would be united to the Son of God, it likewise should bear the same name, being in personal union with him, who was so from all eternity, <p>(x) Misn.

The whole is inferred from the immediately preceding words of the angel, and that in some such way as the following: <span class="ital">The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee</span>; wherefore that, which is being given birth to, <span class="ital">shall be Holy. The Power of the Highest shall overshadow thee</span>; wherefore that Holy thing shall be called <span class="ital">the Son of God</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm" title="He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:">Luke 1:32</a> is parallel to this: Thy Son shall be <span class="ital">great</span>, and shall be called <span class="ital">the Son of the Highest</span>. In Divine things, <span class="ital">greatness</span> and <span class="ital">holiness</span> very much harmonize. It was concerning this Holy One that the same angel spake in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.">Daniel 9:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[9] See Append.

Again the angel makes use of the term "Highest" when alluding to the eternal Father. The expression of Gabriel, "the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee," reminds us of the opening words of Genesis, where the writer describes the dawn of life in creation in the words, "The Spirit of God moved [or, 'brooded'] over the face of the deep." "The Word was conceived in the womb of a woman, not after the manner of men, but by the singular, powerful, invisible, immediate operation of the Holy Ghost, whereby a virgin was, beyond the law of nature, enabled to conceive, and that which was conceived in her was originally and cmnpletcly sanctified" (art. 3, Bishop Pearson on the Creed). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Shall overshadow<p>"Denoting the mildest and most gentle operation of divine power, that the divine fire should not consume Mary, but make her fruitful" (Bengel). Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-7.htm">Mark 9:7</a>. Compare the classical legend of Semele, who, being beloved of Jove, besought him to appear to her as he appeared in heaven, in all the terrors of the thunderer, and was consumed by his lightning. The metaphor in the word is taken from a cloud, in which God had appeared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10</a>). </body></html>
