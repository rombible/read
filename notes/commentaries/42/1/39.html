The form of the proper noun is the same as that in “Bethlehem, of the land of Juda,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-6.htm" title="And you Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, are not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of you shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.">Matthew 2:6</a>. The city may have been one of those assigned to the priests within the limits of the tribe of Judah, and if so, it is interesting to think of the Virgin as undertaking a journey which brought her not far from the very spot in which she was to give birth to the divine Child. No city of the name of Juda is known, but there is a Juttah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-55.htm" title="Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,">Joshua 15:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-16.htm" title="And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.">Joshua 21:16</a>, in the neighbourhood of Maon and the Judæan Carmel, and therefore in the “hill country,” which may possibly be that which is here referred to.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-39.htm" title="And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;...">Luke 1:39-45</a></span>. <span class="ital">Mary arose in those days </span>— That is, soon after the time that she had received the extraordinary message mentioned above; <span class="ital">and went into the hill-country </span>— Where Elisabeth dwelt, although it was at least seventy miles distant from Nazareth. It is probable she was eager to know the certainty of her cousin’s pregnancy, which the angel had mentioned, to show her the possibility of her own. <span class="ital">Into a city of Juda </span>— Probably Hebron, which belonged to the house of Aaron, and was situated in Judea, the mountains of which, running from south to north, gave the name of <span class="ital">the hill-country </span>to a part of it. <span class="ital">And saluted Elisabeth </span>— Immediately on her entering Zacharias’s house: and she no sooner spake than the child in the womb of Elisabeth leaped, as transported with joy, as if sensible of the approach of Him whose forerunner he was appointed to be. And the holy woman Elisabeth was so enlightened by the extraordinary influence of the Holy Ghost, that she instantly knew her cousin Mary had conceived with child of the Messiah, and therefore saluted her by the grand title of, <span class="ital">the mother of my Lord. </span>Being also in a divine and prophetic ecstasy, she uttered things which had an evident relation to the particulars of Mary’s interview with the angel; things, therefore, which she could only know by revelation; so that she astonished Mary exceedingly, and exalted her faith beyond every doubt. <span class="ital">And she spake with a loud voice </span>— Such as testified the greatness of the emotion of her mind; <span class="ital">and said, Blessed art thou among women </span>— The same salutation wherewith Gabriel had addressed Mary; <span class="ital">and blessed is the fruit of thy womb </span>— Alluding probably to the child’s being the promised seed in whom all the families of the earth were to be blessed, and who for that reason was blessed himself. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-17.htm" title="His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.">Psalm 72:17</a>. <span class="ital">And whence is this, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> — If Elisabeth had not been extraordinarily inspired, she could not so much as have suspected that Mary was to be the mother of the Messiah; but this being revealed to her, she was greatly struck with the honour that was done her, and expressed her sense thereof by asking, in a rapture of astonishment, how it came to be conferred upon her. As if she had said, “How have I deserved this honour, that the mother of the Messiah, my Lord and Saviour, should deign to visit me?” <span class="ital">And blessed is she that believed </span>— Here Elisabeth plainly commends the faith and humility which Mary had expressed, when the angel assured her that she should become pregnant in her virgin state; contrary to the behaviour of Zacharias, who, it seems, had informed Elisabeth by writing of all that had happened, or she might come to the knowledge of it by revelation. <span class="ital">For there shall be a performance of those things, </span>&c. — Dr. Campbell reads this clause in connection with the preceding, thus: <span class="ital">Happy is she who believed that the things which the Lord hath promised her shall be performed; </span>understanding the latter clause to be the object of Mary’s faith: and for this reading he assigns solid reasons. Indeed, it is the reading of the margin. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:39-56 It is very good for those who have the work of grace begun in their souls, to communicate one to another. On Mary's arrival, Elisabeth was conscious of the approach of her who was to be the mother of the great Redeemer. At the same time she was filled with the Holy Ghost, and under his influence declared that Mary and her expected child were most blessed and happy, as peculiarly honoured of and dear to the Most High God. Mary, animated by Elisabeth's address, and being also under the influence of the Holy Ghost, broke out into joy, admiration, and gratitude. She knew herself to be a sinner who needed a Saviour, and that she could no otherwise rejoice in God than as interested in his salvation through the promised Messiah. Those who see their need of Christ, and are desirous of righteousness and life in him, he fills with good things, with the best things; and they are abundantly satisfied with the blessings he gives. He will satisfy the desires of the poor in spirit who long for spiritual blessings, while the self-sufficient shall be sent empty away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Mary arose - The word "arose" here is equivalent to "setting out," or starting on a journey.<p>The hill country - The region in the vicinity of Jerusalem, commonly called the hill country of Judea.<p>City of Juda - What city is meant is not known.

The Ethiopic version renders it, "in that day"; directly, immediately, as soon as the angel was gone from her; partly to know the truth of things, and to make use of the sign which had been given her, for the further confirmation of her faith, which was very right and proper for her to do; and partly to converse with Elisabeth about the great things which God had done for each of them, and to praise his name together: "and went into the hill country with haste"; the same which is called the country of the hills, and the hills, and the mountains, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a> where the Septuagint use the same word as here: the land of Judea was divided into three parts,  "the mountain", or hill country, the champaign country, and the valley (b): from Betboron to Emmaus is  "the hill country"; from Emmaus to Lud, or Lydda, is the champaign country; and from Lydda to the sea, the valley (c). This place is frequently called, in the Jewish writings (d), the king's mountain, or the royal mountain, and is said to be very full of cities: ten thousand cities, they say (e), were in the king's mountain, and a thousand of them belonged to R. Eleazer ben Harsum: yea, they say (f), that king Jannai had sixty myriads of cities in the mountain of the king. The Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions render it, "went to the mountain", to this mountain, and which is called the mountain, or, as we read it, the hill country of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-11.htm">Joshua 21:11</a> on which Hebron was situated; and seems to be the city next mentioned: into a city of Judah; for that was given to the children of Aaron and so may reasonably be thought to be the city where Zacharias dwelt, and not Jerusalem, which was in the tribe of Benjamin. Hebron was a city peculiar to the priests; whereas Jerusalem was not; and it was in the hill country of Judea; it was remarkable for the goodness of its stones. It is said (g). <p>"you have no stones in all the land of Israel harder than at Hebron; hence they buried the dead there. <p>(b) Misn. Sheviith, c. 9. sect. 2. Maimon &amp; Bartenora in ib. (c) T.

Thus it is not merely “ne negligeret signum,” etc., Grotius. From Elizabeth she receives the confirmation of that which the angel had announced to her concerning Elizabeth. But before her departure the great promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-35.htm" title="And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come on you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the Son of God.">Luke 1:35</a> is already fulfilled to herself. With extraordinary delicacy the promised conception is not related in its realization (comp., on the other hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-24.htm" title="And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,">Luke 1:24</a>), and the veil of the unparalleled marvel is not attempted to be raised; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-41.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:...">Luke 1:41-44</a> and the whole triumph of Mary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-46.htm" title="And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord,">Luke 1:46</a> ff., presuppose that she appears before Elizabeth already as the mother of the Messiah, bearing Him in her womb.

Luke does not give any more precise definition, and therefore it is to be assumed that he himself had no more precise knowledge.

As a betrothed virgin she would live without seeing her future husband. When however a few weeks sufficed to shew her condition, the female friends about her would be sure to make it known to Joseph.

After the dream which vindicated her innocence we can understand the “haste” with which she would fly to the sympathy of her holy and aged kinswoman and seek for peace in the seclusion of the priestly home. Nothing but the peculiarity of her condition could have permitted the violation of Jewish custom involved in the journey of a betrothed virgin. But for the incidents recorded by St Matthew we should be wholly unable to account for this expression.

Here then it was, we may, not without good reason, conjecture, that the conception of Jesus Christ took place.

Moreover, there were most remarkable motions and emotions in Elisabeth, and her infant in the womb, and in Mary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-41.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:...">Luke 1:41-42</a> : also the particle <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>, for, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-44.htm" title="For, see, as soon as the voice of your salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.">Luke 1:44</a>, has an altogether peculiar weight, expressing the reason why, at this particular point of time, Elisabeth first proclaims Mary to be the mother of her Lord [<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-43.htm" title="And what is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?">Luke 1:43</a>]. Of so great moment, in truth, is the conception, that, if it had happened at Nazareth, He would have been called a Nazarene for that reason, rather than on account of His parents dwelling there. But this fact of their dwelling there is given as the one and only cause of that surname which He bore [ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-24.htm" title="And he said, Truly I say to you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.">Luke 4:24</a>].

As we believe that St. Luke's story here was derived from Mary's own narrative, we can understand well that these details, related by St. Matthew, were scarcely touched upon, and the mother would hurry on to the real points of interest in that eventful past of hers. The hill country here alluded to is the elevated district of Judah, Benjamin, and Mount Ephraim, in contradistinction to the low maritime plain on the east - the old Philistia. <span class="cmt_word">Into a city of Juda</span>. There is no such city known as "Juda." Some have supposed that the text is corrupt here, and that for "Yuda" we should read "Jutta," which, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-55.htm">Joshua 15:55</a>, was a priestly city in the hill country. There is a rabbinical tradition in the Talmud which places the residence of Zacharias at Hebron. It is very probable that Hebron, the great priestly city, is here signified. </body></html>
