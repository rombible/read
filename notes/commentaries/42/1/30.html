Christ must be born miraculously. The angel's address means only, Hail, thou that art the especially chosen and favoured of the Most High, to attain the honour Jewish mothers have so long desired. This wondrous salutation and appearance troubled Mary. The angel then assured her that she had found favour with God, and would become the mother of a son whose name she should call Jesus, the Son of the Highest, one in a nature and perfection with the Lord God. JESUS! the name that refreshes the fainting spirits of humbled sinners; sweet to speak and sweet to hear, Jesus, a Saviour! We know not his riches and our own poverty, therefore we run not to him; we perceive not that we are lost and perishing, therefore a Saviour is a word of little relish. Were we convinced of the huge mass of guilt that lies upon us, and the wrath that hangs over us for it, ready to fall upon us, it would be our continual thought, Is the Saviour mine? And that we might find him so, we should trample on all that hinders our way to him. Mary's reply to the angel was the language of faith and humble admiration, and she asked no sign for the confirming her faith. Without controversy, great was the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh, 1Ti 3:16. Christ's human nature must be produced so, as it was fit that should be which was to be taken into union with the Divine nature. And we must, as Mary here, guide our desires by the word of God. In all conflicts, let us remember that with God nothing is impossible; and as we read and hear his promises, let us turn them into prayers, Behold the willing servant of the Lord; let it be unto me according to thy word.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fear not, Mary - Do not be alarmed at this appearance of an angel.

The mistake of the Vulgate's rendering, "full of grace," has been taken abundant advantage of by the Romish Church. As the mother of our Lord, she was the most "blessed among women" in external distinction; but let them listen to the Lord's own words. "Nay, rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it."

I. Primarily that which gives joy or pleasure; and hence outward beauty, loveliness, something which delights the beholder. Thus Homer, of Ulysses going to the assembly: "Athene shed down manly grace or beauty upon him" ("Odyssey," ii., 12); and Septuagint, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a>, "grace is poured into thy liPsalms" See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-22.htm">Proverbs 3:22</a>. Substantially the same idea, agreeableness, is conveyed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/4-22.htm">Luke 4:22</a>, respecting the gracious words, lit., words of grace, uttered by Christ. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>. II. As a beautiful or agreeable sentiment felt and expressed toward another; kindness, favor, good-will. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-6.htm">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-7.htm">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>. So of the responsive sentiment of thankfulness. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-32.htm">Luke 6:32</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-33.htm">Luke 6:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-34.htm">Luke 6:34</a> :; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-9.htm">Luke 17:9</a>; but mostly in the formula thanks to God; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>. III. The substantial expression of good-will; a boon, a favor, a gift; but not in New Testament. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>, where the distinction is made between &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, grace, and &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, a gift in grace. So a gratification or delight, in classical Greek only; as the delight in battle, in sleep, etc. IV. The higher Christian signification, based on the emphasis of freeness in the gift or favor, and, as commonly in New Testament, denoting the free, spontaneous, absolute loving-kindness of God toward men, and so contrasted with debt, law, works, sin. The word does not occur either in Matthew or Mark. </body></html>
