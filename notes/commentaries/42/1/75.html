The gospel brings light with it; in it the day dawns. In John the Baptist it began to break, and increased apace to the perfect day. The gospel is discovering; it shows that about which we were utterly in the dark; it is to give light to those that sit in darkness, the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. It is reviving; it brings light to those that sit in the shadow of death, as condemned prisoners in the dungeon. It is directing; it is to guide our feet in the way of peace, into that way which will bring us to peace at last, Ro 3:17. John gave proofs of strong faith, vigorous and holy affections, and of being above the fear and love of the world. Thus he ripened for usefulness; but he lived a retired life, till he came forward openly as the forerunner of the Messiah. Let us follow peace with all men, as well as seek peace with God and our own consciences. And if it be the will of God that we live unknown to the world, still let us diligently seek to grow strong in the grace of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In holiness ... - In piety and strict justice.<p>Before him - In the presence of God.

In the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, and in two copies of Beza's, and two of Stephens's, and in the Alexandrian copy, it is only read, "all our days"; but the Arabic version reads, as the generality of copies, and as we render it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In holiness and righteousness <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> before him, all the days of our life.</span><p>(l) To God's good liking.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-75.htm" title="In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.">Luke 1:75</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὁσιότητι</span>: the Godward, religious aspect of conduct (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>).—<span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνῃ</span>: the manward, ethical aspect.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">75</span>. <span class="ital">In holiness</span>] towards God,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and righteousness</span>] towards men.

Compare the fine passage in the "Antigone" of Sophocles (453-55):<p>"Nor did I deem thy edicts strong enough,<p>That thou, a mortal man, shouldst overpass<p>The unwritten laws of God that know not change,<p>They are not of to-day nor yesterday,<p>But live forever, nor can man assign<p>When first they sprang to being."<p>Hence &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; is concerned primarily with the eternal laws of God. It is "the divine consecration and inner truth of righteousness" (Meyer). Throughout the New Testament its look is godward. In no case is it used of moral excellence as related to men, though it is to be carefully noted that &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, righteousness, is not restricted to rightness toward men. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>; true holiness; literally, holiness of the truth. </body></html>
