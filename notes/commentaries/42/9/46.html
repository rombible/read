The evangelists, however, may be reconciled by translating Luke’s words, <span class="greekheb">εισηλθε δε διαλογισμος εν αυτοις</span>, <span class="ital">Now there had arisen a reasoning among them</span> — Namely, as they travelled to Capernaum. This kind of reasoning, it may be observed, always arose at the most improper times that could be imagined; <span class="ital">which of them should be greatest </span>— Thus they clearly manifested their ambitious views, and their carnal, worldly spirit; and how entirely they misunderstood the nature of Christ’s kingdom, which is not of this world; <span class="ital">and Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart </span>— For he perfectly knew all that passed within them; <span class="ital">took a child and said unto them</span> — If you would be truly great, humble yourselves to the meanest offices: he that is least in his own eyes shall be great indeed. For a full explanation of this occurrence, and of our Lord’s improvement of it, and lessons taught his disciples on the occasion, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/18-1.htm" title="At the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?...">Matthew 18:1-6</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/9-33.htm" title="And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that you disputed among yourselves by the way?...">Mark 9:33-40</a>, where the two next verses also are explained. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:43-50 This prediction of Christ's sufferings was plain enough, but the disciples would not understand it, because it agreed not with their notions. A little child is the emblem by which Christ teaches us simplicity and humility. What greater honour can any man attain to in this world, than to be received by men as a messenger of God and Christ; and to have God and Christ own themselves received and welcomed in him! If ever any society of Christians in this world, had reason to silence those not of their own communion, the twelve disciples at this time had; yet Christ warned them not to do the like again. Those may be found faithful followers of Christ, and may be accepted of him, who do not follow with us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-1.htm">Matthew 18:1-5</a>.

This paragraph showeth what need there was of the preceding discourse, that our Saviour should prepare them with a preinforming them about his suffering, that when they saw it their faith in him as the Messiah might not fail; for they were possessed with the common notion of their country, that the Messiah should deliver them from the temporal pressures which they were under, and exercise a civil or military secular power; this made them think of places of priority and greatness, about which we often find them disputing. Our Lord, to bring them off that false notion of him and his kingdom, taketh a child, and setteth him before them, and saith, <span class="ital">Whosoever shall receive this child, &c.</span> What Luke saith must be interpreted by what we had before in Matthew and Mark.

This question of rank, which Mark introduces with greater historical detail, is not referred in Mark and Luke specially to the Messiah’s kingdom, as is the case in Matthew.

The <span class="ital">child</span> placed there is the living type of the <span class="ital">humble</span> disciple as he, in opposition to that arrogant disposition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-46.htm" title="Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.">Luke 9:46</a>, ought to be. And <span class="ital">this child</span> standing there as such a moral type, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> every disciple of Christ like to him in unassuming humility, is <span class="ital">so highly esteemed before God</span>, that whosoever lovingly receives him, etc. <span class="ital">For</span> (<span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, introducing a confirmatory explanation) <span class="ital">he who is less</span> (than the others) <span class="ital">among you all</span> (to wit, subjectively, according to his own estimation of himself) <span class="ital">is great</span> (objectively, in accordance with his real worth).

And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart.</span> Somewhere on their journey back to the south, between the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi and the old scene of his labours, Capernaum, this dispute must have taken place. Shortly after their arrival at Capernaum, the Master called them together, and gave them the following lesson on human greatness. <span class="cmt_word">Took a child, and set him by him</span>. St. Mark mentions that this teaching was "in the house," and commentators have suggested, with some probability, that the house was St. Peter's, and the child one of his. Clement of Alexandria ('Stromata,' 3:448, B) especially mentions that this apostle had children. St. Matthew relates this incident at greater length, and, still dwelling upon the text of "<span class="accented">the</span> little <span class="accented">one</span>," gives us another and different sketch of the <span class="accented">Master's</span> teaching on this occasion. St. Mark tells us how Jesus folded his arms round the little creature in loving fondness. If the child, as above suggested, was Peter's own, such an incident as that embrace would never have been forgotten by the father, and would, of course, find a place in the memoir of his faithful disciple Mark. A (late) tradition of the Eastern Church identifies this child with him who afterwards became the famous Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, a martyr. Ignatius styled himself Theophoros; this, understood in a <span class="accented">passive</span> sense, would signify "one who had been carried by God." But in this Father's own writings we find the name used by himself in an <span class="accented">active</span> sense, as "one who carries God within himself." <span class="accented">And Jesus</span>, <span class="accented">perceiving the thought of their heart</span>, <span class="accented">took a child.</span> The dispute "which of them should be greatest," which no doubt had taken place among themselves in their last journey from the north of the Holy Land to Capernaum, was still a leading thought in the hearts of the twelve, so little had they really understood their Master's teaching, and especially his later solemn words which pointed the <span class="accented">way of the cross</span> as the only way to heaven and to <span class="accented">real greatness.</span> The Lord reads these poor sinful hearts; then, calling them together, he takes a child in his arms, and sets him by him. <span class="accented">By this action</span> the Lord answers the silent questioning thought  of the worldly twelve. "The child stands as the type of the humble and childlike disciple, and (the dispute having been about the comparative greatness of the disciples) such a disciple is the greatest; he is so honoured by God that he stands on earth as the representative of Christ, and of God himself (ver. 47), since "he that is [willingly] least among you all, the same shall be [truly] great' (ver. 48)" (Meyer). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A reasoning (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>A debate or discussion.
