He spake unto them of the kingdom of God. He healed those who had need of healing. And with five loaves of bread and two fishes, Christ fed five thousand men. He will not see those that fear him, and serve him faithfully, want any good thing. When we receive creature-comforts, we must acknowledge that we receive them from God, and that we are unworthy to receive them; that we owe them all, and all the comfort we have in them, to the mediation of Christ, by whom the curse is taken away. The blessing of Christ will make a little go a great way. He fills every hungry soul, abundantly satisfies it with the goodness of his house. Here were fragments taken up: in our Father's house there is bread enough, and to spare. We are not straitened, nor stinted in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Day began to wear away - To decline, or as it drew near toward evening. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 9:10-17.

Beza observes, that in his most ancient copy, it is read, "he blessed upon them"; which perfectly agrees with the Jewish way of speaking,   "he that blesseth upon the bread";   "he that blesseth upon the wine"; and so upon the fruits of trees, and upon the fruits of the earth, and upon other things (s); <p>and brake; the loaves, and divided the fishes into parts: <p>and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude; as they sat in ranks, and in their distinct companies. <p>(s) Misn.

But “Falleret momento visum...Est quod non erat; videtur quod non intelligitur” (Hilary). The marvel lay in the Doer, not in the deed.

The blessing was the usual introduction of a pious Jewish family to a meal. It was pronounced by the head of the household. An ordinary formula was, "May God, the Ever-blessed One, bless what he has given us!" The Jewish barley loaves were broad, thin cakes; these were usually <span class="accented">broken</span>, not out - hence the expression, "and brake." In SS. Mark and Luke the tense of the verb rendered "gave," in the original Greek, is an imperfect, and signifies, "he gave, and kept on giving." This supplies a hint as to the way of working the miracle. Each disciple kept coming to him for a fresh supply of bread. It was, however, as it has been well said, a miracle of the highest order, one of creative power, and is to us inconceivable. The evangelists make no attempt to explain it. They evidently did not care to ask. They beheld it, and related it to us just as they saw it in its simple grandeur. Neither disciples nor crowds seem at first to have grasped the stupendous nature of the act. St. John tells us of its effect on the crowds, who, when they came to see what had been done, wished to take him by force and make him king. For a brief space they were convinced that in the poor Galilee Rabbi they had found King Messiah - none but he could have done this great thing. They were right. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Brake and gave (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Note the two tenses, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41</a>, and see note there.<p>To set before (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit., to set beside, since the table was at the side of the guest.
