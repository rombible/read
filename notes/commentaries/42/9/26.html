Jesus discourses concerning his own sufferings and death. And so far must his disciples be from thinking how to prevent his sufferings, that they must prepare for their own. We often meet with crosses in the way of duty; and though we must not pull them upon our own heads, yet, when they are laid for us, we must take them up, and carry them after Christ. It is well or ill with us, according as it is well or ill with our souls. The body cannot be happy, if the soul be miserable in the other world; but the soul may be happy, though the body is greatly afflicted and oppressed in this world. We must never be ashamed of Christ and his gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Christ of God - The "Anointed" of God.

When one is, in this sense of it, lost to shame, he is nearly past hope (Zec 3:5; Jer 6:15; 3:3). But when Christ and "His words"&#8212;Christianity, especially in its more spiritual and uncompromising features&#8212;are unpopular, the same instinctive desire to stand well with others begets the temptation to be ashamed of Him, which only the 'expulsive power' of a higher affection can effectually counteract.<p>Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh, &c.&#8212;He will render to that man his own treatment; He will disown him before the most august of all assemblies, and put him to "shame and everlasting contempt" (Da 12:2).

Here follows the punishment in the world to come. It consists in the Judge's solemn award to the man who has succeeded in saving his life in this world. The award is, "Depart from me: I know you not." Of such a selfish soul, who here has loved his own ease, and has declined all self-sacrifice, will the Son of man, in the day of his glory, be justly ashamed. The suffering Messiah thus completed his vivid picture of himself. Not always was he to suffer, or to wear the robe of humiliation. The Despised and Rejected would assuredly return with a glory indescribable, inconceivable. His assertion, advanced here, that <span class="accented">he</span> will return as Almighty Judge, is very remarkable. In the parallel passage in St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13</a>) it is put even more clearly. There Jesus asks his disciples, "Whom do men say that <span class="accented">I</span>, <span class="accented">the Son of man</span>, am?" In ver. 27 Jesus goes on to say, "The <span class="accented">Son of man</span> shall  come in the glory of <span class="accented">his</span> Father, with <span class="accented">his</span> angels, and then <span class="accented">he</span> shall reward every man according to his works." The lesson was very clear. His own might surely be content. Only let them be patient. Lo! in <span class="accented">the</span> poor rejected Rabbi now before them, going to his bitter suffering and his death, they were looking really on the awful form of the Almighty Judge of quick and dead. These words, very dimly understood <span class="accented">then</span>, in days to come were often recalled by his hearers. They formed the groundwork of many a primitive apostolic sermon. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Shall be ashamed (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834;)<p>The feeling expressed by this word has reference to incurring dishonor or shame in the eyes of men. It is "the grief a mail conceives from his own imperfections considered with relation to the world taking notice of them; grief upon the sense of disesteem" ("South," cit. by Trench). Hence it does not spring out of a reverence for right in itself, but from fear of the knowledge and opinion of men. Thus in the use of the kindred noun &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, shame, in the New Testament. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-9.htm">Luke 14:9</a>, the man who impudently puts himself in the highest place at the feast, and is bidden by his host to go lower down, begins with shame to take the lowest place; not from a right sense of his folly and conceit, but from being humiliated in the eyes of the guests. Thus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>, Christ is said to have "endured the shame," i.e., the public disgrace attaching to crucifixion. So, too, in the use of the verb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a> : "I am not ashamed of the gospel," though espousing its cause subjects me to the contempt of the Jew and of the Greek, to whom it is a stumbling-block and foolishness. Onesiphorus was not ashamed to be known as the friend of a prisoner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm">2 Timothy 1:16</a>). Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-16.htm">Hebrews 11:16</a>. It is used of the Son of Man here by a strong metaphor. Literally, of course, the glorified Christ cannot experience the sense of shame, but the idea at the root is the same. It will be as if he should feel himself disgraced before the Father and the holy angels in owning any fellowship with those who have been ashamed of him.<p>His glory, etc<p>Threefold glory. His own, as the exalted Messiah; the glory of God, who owns him as his dearly beloved son, and commits to him the judgment; and the glory of the angels who attend him. </body></html>
