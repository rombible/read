A little child is the emblem by which Christ teaches us simplicity and humility. What greater honour can any man attain to in this world, than to be received by men as a messenger of God and Christ; and to have God and Christ own themselves received and welcomed in him! If ever any society of Christians in this world, had reason to silence those not of their own communion, the twelve disciples at this time had; yet Christ warned them not to do the like again. Those may be found faithful followers of Christ, and may be accepted of him, who do not follow with us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-1.htm">Matthew 18:1-5</a>.

Not by any words he had heard; for the dispute was on the road, as they came along behind him; but as the omniscient God, who is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, he was privy to all their ambition, and the vanity of their minds, and to all their reasonings and debates: though he was before them, and out of the reach of hearing of them: and when he came to Capernaum, after having asked them what they disputed about by the way; <p>he took a child and set him by him. The Ethiopic version reads, "before them", the disciples; and Matthew and Mark say, "he set him in the midst of them"; all which were true, Jesus sitting in the midst of them; so, that the child he set by him, was in the middle of them and before them; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-2.htm">Matthew 18:2</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-47.htm" title="And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,">Luke 9:47</a>. <span class="greekheb">παρʼ ἑαυτῷ</span>, beside Himself, not <span class="greekheb">ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν</span>, as in Mt. and Mk., as if to say, here is the greater one.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">47</span>. <span class="ital">perceiving the thought of their heart</span>] He asked the subject of their dispute, and when shame kept them silent, He sat down, and calling a little child, made the Twelve stand around while He taught this solemn lesson.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">took a child</span>] This could not have been the future martyr St Ignatius, as legend says (Niceph.
