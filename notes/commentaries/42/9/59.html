If we mean to follow Christ, we must lay aside the thoughts of great things in the world. Let us not try to join the profession of Christianity, with seeking after worldly advantages. Here is another that seems resolved to follow Christ, but he begs a short delay. To this man Christ first gave the call; he said to him, Follow me. Religion teaches us to be kind and good, to show piety at home, and to requite our parents; but we must not make these an excuse for neglecting our duty to God. Here is another that is willing to follow Christ, but he must have a little time to talk with his friends about it, and to set in order his household affairs, and give directions concerning them. He seemed to have worldly concerns more upon his heart than he ought to have, and he was willing to enter into a temptation leading him from his purpose of following Christ. No one can do any business in a proper manner, if he is attending to other things. Those who begin with the work of God, must resolve to go on, or they will make nothing of it. Looking back, leads to drawing back, and drawing back is to perdition. He only that endures to the end shall be saved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-19.htm">Matthew 8:19-22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 9:57-62.

Alex. <span class="ital">Strom,</span> ill. 4, § 25), says that this was Philip. This man was already a disciple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-21.htm" title="And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.">Matthew 8:21</a>). The request could hardly mean ‘let me live at home till my father’s death,’ which would be too indefinite an offer; nor can it well mean that his father was lying unburied, for in that case the disciple would hardly have been among the crowd. Perhaps it meant ‘let me go and give a farewell funeral feast, and put everything in order.’ The man was bidden to be Christ’s Nazarite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/6-6.htm" title="All the days that he separates himself to the LORD he shall come at no dead body....">Numbers 6:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-59.htm" title="And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.">Luke 9:59</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀπελθόντι</span>, <span class="ital">having departed</span> [<span class="ital">i.e. to go and</span>]) The dative. Here the man takes for granted his <span class="ital">departure</span>, does not ask leave for it. A different Kind of <span class="ital">departure</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀπελθὼν</span>, “<span class="ital">go thou</span> and preach”) is enjoined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-60.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go you and preach the kingdom of God.">Luke 9:60</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 59, 60.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</span> In this case the Master was the Summoner. Something he read in this man's heart, or words he had heard him speak, moved the Redeemer's great love, so he gave him a special call. This was a very different character from the last. Whereas <span class="accented">that</span> seeker for work from Jesus was impulsive, and even thoughtless in his enthusiasm, one who would begin to act without counting the cost, <span class="accented">this</span> one was overcautious, cold and calculating to an ungenerous excess; yet there was evidently sterling stuff in the character, for Jesus argues and remonstrates with him; there was, too, much gold mingled with the earth of that man's disposition, for the Lord lightly to let it go. It is thus that the Spirit pleads still with the selfishness which disfigures many a noble and devoted servant of high God. He seems to say, "My call is too imperative to yield to any home duties, however orderly and respectable." During the official days of mourning (in the case of a funeral, these were seven) the impression now made by his summoning words would have worn off. It is noticeable that the home duties, which Jesus suggested should give place to other and more imperative claims, were in connection with <span class="accented">the dead.</span> It was not the <span class="accented">living</span> father who was to be left to hirelings, only the inanimate corpse. It was rather a <span class="accented">society</span> call than a <span class="accented">home</span> or <span class="accented">family</span> duty which was to give place to work for the Master. St. Chrysostom makes some quaint, but strikingly practical, remarks here. "He might need, if he went to the funeral, to proceed, after the burial, to make inquiry about the will, and then about the distribution of the inheritance, and all the other things that followed thereupon; and thus waves after waves of things coming in upon him in succession might bear him very far away from the harbour of truth. For this cause, doubtless, the Saviour draws him, and fastens him to himself." </body></html>
