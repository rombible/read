There were some who were really looking for the coming of the Messianic kingdom; there were some who altogether rejected the claim of Jesus of Nazareth to be the Christ. In the lips of the one set, the question implied a taunt; in those of the other, something like impatience. The terms of the answer contain that which met both cases.<p><span class= "bld">Cometh not with observation.</span>—The English noun exactly answers to the meaning of the Greek, as meaning careful and anxious watching. There was, perhaps, a special force in the word, as referring to the two forms of “watching” of which our Lord had been the object. Some of the Pharisees had “observed” Him once and again with a purpose more or less hostile. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-7.htm" title="And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.">Luke 6:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him.">Luke 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-2.htm" title="And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.">Mark 3:2</a>; where the Greek verb is that from which the noun here used is derived.) Others were looking for some sign from heaven, to show that He was the promised Head of the Kingdom. They are told that when it comes it will not be in conjunction with any such “observation” of outward things; it would burst upon them suddenly. In the meantime they must look for the signs of its presence in quite another region. The marginal reading, “outward shew”—that which is subject to observation—though giving an adequate meaning, is rather a paraphrase than a translation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/17-20.htm" title="And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:...">Luke 17:20-21</a>. </span><span class="ital">When he was demanded of the Pharisees </span>— It is uncertain whether what is here mentioned took place while our Lord was on his journey, or after he came to Jerusalem; <span class="ital">when the kingdom of God should come </span>— That is, when the kingdom of the Messiah, which they had learned to term <span class="ital">the kingdom of God, </span>was to commence? They had very grand notions of the extent of the Messiah’s kingdom, of the number of his subjects, the strength of his armies, the pomp and eclat of his court, and were eager to hear of its being speedily erected. Or, being inveterate enemies of Christ, they might possibly ask the question in derision, because every thing about Jesus was very unlike to the Messiah whom they expected. <span class="ital">He answered, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation</span> — With such outward pomp as draws the observation of mankind: or, as Dr. Whitby explains the expression, not with that royal splendour or worldly grandeur which shall render it conspicuous in the eyes of the world, as you expect. <span class="ital">Neither shall they say, Lo here, or, Lo there </span>— This shall not be the language of those who are, or shall be, sent by me to declare the coming of my kingdom, nor shall men seek for it in this or that place, saying, Lo, it is here, or, Lo, it is there; <span class="ital">for behold, the kingdom of God is within you </span>— It is an internal, spiritual kingdom; erected in the hearts of men, consisting in the subjection of their wills to the will of God, and in the conformity of their minds to his laws. Wherever it exists, it exists in men’s hearts. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>. Or, as our Lord was addressing the Jews, and especially the Pharisees, and cannot be understood as speaking of the power his kingdom had gained over their hearts, whose temper was entirely alienated from the nature and design of it; the clause, perhaps, ought rather to be rendered, <span class="ital">The kingdom of God is among you. </span>Thus Beza, Raphelius, Whitby, Doddridge, and many others understand it: namely, as signifying that the Messiah’s kingdom began now to appear among them, the gospel of the kingdom being now preached, miracles, in confirmation of it, being wrought, and the grace of God, which accompanied it, turning many sinners from the evil of their ways, and transforming them into the divine image. Thus Grotius paraphrases the passage, <span class="ital">“Already among you;” </span>that is, “among this very Jewish people, that kingdom begins to exert its power; you not observing it, and an evident sign of this are miracles. Accordingly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a>, Christ speaks to the same Pharisees after this manner: <span class="ital">If I, by the finger of God, cast out devils, </span>then is the kingdom of God come nigh unto you; or rather, <span class="ital">come upon, </span>or <span class="ital">among you, </span>(as <span class="greekheb">εφθασεν εφ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">υμας</span>, properly means,) where, by the word <span class="ital">you, </span>the whole Jewish people are in like manner intended.” See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-43.htm" title="Therefore say I to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.">Matthew 21:43</a>, where our Lord says, <span class="ital">The kingdom of God shall be taken from you.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:20-37 The kingdom of God was among the Jews, or rather within some of them. It was a spiritual kingdom, set up in the heart by the power of Divine grace. Observe how it had been with sinners formerly, and in what state the judgments of God, which they had been warned of, found them. Here is shown what a dreadful surprise this destruction will be to the secure and sensual. Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. When Christ came to destroy the Jewish nation by the Roman armies, that nation was found in such a state of false security as is here spoken of. In like manner, when Jesus Christ shall come to judge the world, sinners will be found altogether regardless; for in like manner the sinners of every age go on securely in their evil ways, and remember not their latter end. But wherever the wicked are, who are marked for eternal ruin, they shall be found by the judgments of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Was demanded - Was asked.<p>Of the Pharisees - This was a matter of much importance to them, and they had taught that it would come with parade and pomp.

He did not deny that, according to their views, the time was drawing near; but he denied that his kingdom would come in the "manner" in which they expected. The Messiah would "not" come with pomp like an earthly prince; perhaps not in such a manner as to be "discerned" by the eyes of sagacious and artful people, who were expecting him in a way agreeable to their own feelings. The kingdom of God is "within" people, and it makes its way, not by pomp and noise, but by silence, decency, and order, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 17:20-37. Coming of the Kingdom of God and of the Son of Man.<p>20-25. when, &c.&#8212;To meet the erroneous views not only of the Pharisees, but of the disciples themselves, our Lord addresses both, announcing the coming of the kingdom under different aspects.<p>It cometh not with observation&#8212;with watching or lying in wait, as for something outwardly imposing and at once revealing itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whether the Pharisees spake this deriding him, who in his discourses had been often mentioning a kingdom of God to come, or in simple seriousness, for they generally expected the coming of a Messiah, and a secular kingdom, which he should exercise in the earth, particularly over the Jews, (having first destroyed the Gentiles), is very hard to determine; their mean opinion of Christ inclineth some to think the former; their generally received opinion about the kingdom of the Messiah giveth some countenance to the latter. Our Saviour’s answer fitteth them, whatsoever they intended by their question: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The kingdom of God</span> (saith he) <span class="bld">cometh not</span> meta parathrhsewv, <span class="bld">with observation.</span> The word signifies a scrupulous and superstitious observation. Thus the verb from whence it cometh signifieth, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-10.htm" title="You observe days, and months, and times, and years.">Galatians 4:10</a></span>. The verb also signifies a captious observation, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-2.htm" title="And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.">Mark 3:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-7.htm" title="And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.">Luke 6:7</a> 14:1 <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-20.htm" title="And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.">Luke 20:20</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-24.htm" title="But their laying await was known of Saul.

The generality of the best interpreters agree the sense here to be, with external pomp and splendour; and therefore Beza expounds the noun here by a periphrasis, <span class="ital">ita ut observari poterit, </span> in such a manner as it can be observed. As if he had said, Men have taken up a false notion of my kingdom, as if it were to be a secular kingdom to be set up in the world, with a great deal of noise, and pomp, and splendour, so as men may observe it and gaze upon its coming. But that which I call my kingdom is not of this nature. Our Lord expounds it in the next verse: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The kingdom of God is within you; </span> it is of a spiritual nature, not obvious to human senses, but exercised over the hearts of my people. Whether our Saviour speaketh this in reply to the Pharisees, or (as some think) beginning a discourse with his disciples, which he further pursueth, I cannot determine. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when he was demanded of the Pharisees,.... Or "asked" by them; who expected the Messiah, and that when he was come he would set up a temporal kingdom, and deliver them from the Roman yoke; when they should enjoy great liberty, peace, and prosperity; so that they might put the following question to Christ in a serious manner, agreeably to these expectations: or it may be occasioned by the frequent mention that had been made of the kingdom of God by John, and Christ, and his disciples in their ministry, and so be put in a way of derision; or, as most of their questions were, with a view to ensnare or puzzle: <p>when the kingdom of God should come; either the kingdom that God had promised, or the kingdom of the Messiah, who is truly God, that had been so often spoken of by John the Baptist, Christ, and his apostles. The Ethiopic version reads, "the kingdom of heaven", which is the same with the kingdom of God; for these phrases are promiscuously used. This question they need not have asked, had they carefully attended to the writings of the Old Testament they had in their hands; and had they diligently observed the signs of the times, in which they lived; and had they seriously regarded the ministry and miracles of Christ among them; from these things, they might have concluded, not only that the time was at hand, when the kingdom of God should be set up, but that it was already come: they might have observed, that not only the harbinger of the Messiah was come, who was John the Baptist; but that the Messiah himself was among them, by the many wonderful things which he wrought among them, and by the many Scripture prophecies which were fulfilled in him; they might have seen that the sceptre was manifestly departing from Judah; that all power and authority were falling into the hands of the Romans; and that only a mere shadow and appearance of it were among them; they might have known, by calculation, that the time fixed in Daniel's prophecy, for the coming of the Messiah, was now up, and therefore he must be come; and they had very good reason to believe that Jesus was he. <p>He answered them and said, the kingdom of God cometh not with observation; or so as to be observed by the eye, or to be distinguished when it comes as the kingdoms of this world, by outward pomp and splendour, by temporal riches, external honours, and worldly power and grandeur; though it so far came with observation, that had they had eyes to see, they might have observed that it was come, by what they saw done by Christ, particularly the power that he showed in the dispossessing devils out of the bodies of men; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a>. The Syriac version reads, "with observations"; and some understand the words of the observances of the ceremonies of the law, of days, months, and years, and the difference of meats, and the like, which the kingdom of God is not in, and which were to cease upon its coming; but the former sense is best. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> observation:</span><p>(7) The kingdom of God is not discerned by many although it is most present before their eyes, because they foolishly persuade themselves that it is to come with outward pomp.<p>(b) With any outward pomp and show of majesty to be known by: for there were still many plain and evident tokens by which men might have understood that Christ was the Messiah, whose kingdom had been so long looked for: but he speaks in this place of those signs which the Pharisees dreamed of, who looked for an earthly Messianic kingdom.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/luke/17.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/17-20.htm" title="And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:...">Luke 17:20-21</a>.

See what follows. The coming is <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρατήρητον</span>—it developes itself <span class="ital">unnoticed</span>. This statement, however, does not deny that the kingdom <span class="ital">is a thing of the future</span> (Ewald: “as something which should first come in the future, as a wonderful occurrence, and for which men must first be on the watch”), but only that in its approach <span class="ital">it will meet the eye</span>. In the signification of watching and waiting for, <span class="greekheb">παρατήρησις</span> would convey the idea of <span class="ital">malice</span> (<span class="ital">insidiosa observatio</span>, Polybius, xvi. 22. 8); but in the further descriptive <span class="greekheb">οὐδέ</span> (<span class="ital">not even</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἐροῦσιν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., is implied only the denial of <span class="ital">the visibility</span> of the event which, developing itself (“gradatim et successive,” Bengel), might be able to be <span class="ital">observed</span> (comp. <span class="greekheb">παρατήρησις τῶν ἄστρων</span>, Diod.

In this section the words of Jesus are distributed between Pharisees and disciples, possibly according to the evangelist’s impression as to the audience they suited.

I am inclined to attach some weight to this suggestion.

The following discourse of the Lord in reply to the Pharisee's question, 'When cometh the kingdom? was delivered, clearly, in the closing days of the ministry, probably just before the Passover Feast, and in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. The query was certainly not put in a friendly spirit. The questioners had evidently caught the drift of much of our Lord's late teaching, and had seen how plainly he was alluding to himself as Messiah. This seems to have been the starting-point of their bitter, impatient inquiry. We must remember that the great rabbinic schools in which these Pharisees had received their training connected the coming of Messiah with a grand revival of Jewish power. If in reality this Galilaean Rabbi, with his strange powers, his new doctrines, his scathing words of reproach which he was ever presuming to address to the leaders in Israel, - if in reality he were Messiah, when was that golden age, which the long looked-for Hope of Israel was to introduce, to commence? But the words, we can well conceive, were spoken with the bitterest irony. With what scorn those proud, rich men from Jerusalem looked on the friendless Teacher of Galilee, we know. We seem to hear the muttering which accompanied the question: "Thou our King Messiah!" The kingdom of God cometh not with observation. This answer of our Lord's may be paraphrased: "The kingdom of God cometh not in conjunction with such observation and watching for external glorious things as now exist among you here. Lo, it will burst upon you suddenly, unawares." The English word "<span class="accented">observation"</span> answers to the signification of the Greek as meaning a singularly anxious watching. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>With observation (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here in New Testament.
