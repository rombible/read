It was a spiritual kingdom, set up in the heart by the power of Divine grace. Observe how it had been with sinners formerly, and in what state the judgments of God, which they had been warned of, found them. Here is shown what a dreadful surprise this destruction will be to the secure and sensual. Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. When Christ came to destroy the Jewish nation by the Roman armies, that nation was found in such a state of false security as is here spoken of. In like manner, when Jesus Christ shall come to judge the world, sinners will be found altogether regardless; for in like manner the sinners of every age go on securely in their evil ways, and remember not their latter end. But wherever the wicked are, who are marked for eternal ruin, they shall be found by the judgments of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They did eat ... - They were busy in the affairs of this life, as if nothing were about to happen.<p>The same day ... - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-23.htm">Genesis 19:23-25</a>. "It rained." The word here used "might" have been rendered "he" rained. In Genesis it is said that the "Lord" did it.<p>Fire and brimstone - God destroyed Sodom on account of its great wickedness. He took vengeance on it for its sins; and the example of Sodom is set before people to deter them from committing great transgressions, and as a "full proof" that God will punish the guilty. See Jde 1:7; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>. Yet, in overthrowing it, he used natural means. He is not to be supposed to have "created" fire and brimstone for the occasion, but to have "directed" the natural means at his disposal for their overthrow; as he did not "create" the waters to drown the world, but merely broke up the fountains of the great deep and opened the windows of heaven. Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>, were four great cities, on a plain where is now the Dead Sea, at the southeast of Palestine, and into which the river Jordan flows. They were built on ground which abounded, doubtless, as all that region now does, in "bitumen or naphtha," which is easily kindled, and which burns with great intensity. The phrase "fire and brimstone" is a Hebrew form of expression, denoting sulphurous fire, or fire having the smell of sulphur; and may denote a volcanic eruption, or any burning like that of naphtha. There is no improbability in supposing either that this destruction was accomplished by lightning, which ignited the naphtha, or that it was a volcanic eruption, which, by direction of God, overthrew the wicked cities.<p>From heaven - By command of God, or from the sky. To the people of Sodom it had "the appearance" of coming from heaven, as all volcanic eruptions would have. Hundreds of towns have been overthrown in this way, and all by the agency of God. He rules the elements, and makes them his instruments, at his pleasure, in accomplishing the destruction of the wicked.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26-30. eat &#8230; married &#8230; planted&#8212;all the ordinary occupations and enjoyments of life.

"The Jews" (i) say it was the sixteenth day of Nisan: <p>it rained fire and brimstone from heaven; the Syriac version reads, "the Lord rained"; so it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a> "the Lord rained from the Lord"; Jehovah the Son, rained from Jehovah the Father; or the word of the Lord, as the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem render it; and which is no inconsiderable proof of the deity of Christ: and the Persic version here reads, "God rained"; and so this amazing shower of fire and brimstone, and which was a violent storm of thunder and lightning, is ascribed to God in See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>. The Hebrew word,  used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a> though it is rendered in the Targum of Jonathan,  and by the Septuagint,  both which words signify "sulphur", or brimstone; and which last word is used here, following the Greek version; yet it is observed, by some learned men, that it rather signifies "pitch", or "rosin", which proceeds from some sort of trees; and indeed, by its derivation, it seems to signify something belonging to or that comes out of the wood of Gopher, of which the ark was made, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-14.htm">Genesis 6:14</a> which some think to be the pine tree, from whence comes pitch: and this, though it comes from the inside of a tree, may as well be said to be rained from heaven, as brimstone, which is taken out of the bowels of the earth: and the rather, since pitch is sometimes fluid; and especially it being combustible, may be joined with fire, as well as sulphur, or brimstone; though a shower of neither, can be accounted for in an ordinary way, but must be extraordinary and miraculous: the destruction of this city, with others, by fire from heaven, and the lake Asphaltites, being a bituminous and sulphureous one, into which the tract of land they stood upon was converted, are confirmed by the testimonies of Heathen writers; as Tacitus (k), Solinus (l), Strabo (m), Justin (n), and Pliny (o); as well as by Josephus (p), and Philo the Jew (q). <p>And destroyed them all; all the inhabitants of Sodom, and all of Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim; and which was an ensample of the destruction of Jerusalem, and the land of Judea. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> and of the burning of the world, and of the perdition of the wicked in hell, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-6.htm">2 Peter 2:6</a>. <p>(i) Bereshit Rabba, sect. 50. fol. 45. 3.((k) Hist. l. 5.
