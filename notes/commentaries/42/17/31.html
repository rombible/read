It was a spiritual kingdom, set up in the heart by the power of Divine grace. Observe how it had been with sinners formerly, and in what state the judgments of God, which they had been warned of, found them. Here is shown what a dreadful surprise this destruction will be to the secure and sensual. Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. When Christ came to destroy the Jewish nation by the Roman armies, that nation was found in such a state of false security as is here spoken of. In like manner, when Jesus Christ shall come to judge the world, sinners will be found altogether regardless; for in like manner the sinners of every age go on securely in their evil ways, and remember not their latter end. But wherever the wicked are, who are marked for eternal ruin, they shall be found by the judgments of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-17.htm">Matthew 24:17-18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31-33. to take it away &#8230; Remember, &c.&#8212;a warning against that lingering reluctance to part with present treasures which induces some to remain in a burning house, in hopes of saving this and that precious article till consumed and buried in its ruins.

The Lord, with this striking imagery, describes, not the attitude which men who would be saved must assume when he appears with power and great glory - there will be no time then to shape any new way of life - but it pictures the attitude they must always maintain, if they would be his servants, towards the things of this world. His servants must be ready to abandon all earthly blessings at a moment's notice; none but those who have been sitting loosely to these will be able, when the sudden cry comes, at once to toss away all, and so to meet the long-tarrying Bridegroom. The reminder of Lot's wife - a very familiar story to Jews - warned all would-be disciples of the danger of the double service, God and the world, and how likely the one who attempted it would be to perish miserably. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Goods<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-29.htm">Matthew 12:29</a>.<p>On the house-top<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-17.htm">Matthew 24:17</a>. </body></html>
