So taken. the words emphatically assert the actual presence of the Kingdom. It was already in the midst of them at the very time when they were asking when it would appear. The use of the Greek preposition is, however, all but decisive against this interpretation. It is employed for that which is “within,” as contrasted with that which is “without,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-26.htm" title="You blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.">Matthew 23:26</a>, and in the LXX. version for the “inward parts,” or spiritual nature of man, as contrasted with the outward, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-1.htm" title="Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.">Psalm 103:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-22.htm" title="For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.">Psalm 109:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm" title="Why my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kirharesh.">Isaiah 16:11</a>. It was in that region, in the life which must be born again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>), that men were to look for the kingdom; and there, whether they accepted it or rejected it, they would find sufficient tokens of its power.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:20-37 The kingdom of God was among the Jews, or rather within some of them. It was a spiritual kingdom, set up in the heart by the power of Divine grace. Observe how it had been with sinners formerly, and in what state the judgments of God, which they had been warned of, found them. Here is shown what a dreadful surprise this destruction will be to the secure and sensual. Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. When Christ came to destroy the Jewish nation by the Roman armies, that nation was found in such a state of false security as is here spoken of. In like manner, when Jesus Christ shall come to judge the world, sinners will be found altogether regardless; for in like manner the sinners of every age go on securely in their evil ways, and remember not their latter end. But wherever the wicked are, who are marked for eternal ruin, they shall be found by the judgments of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Lo here! or, Lo there!" When an earthly prince visits different parts of his territories, he does it with pomp. His movements attract observation, and become the common topic of conversation. The inquiry is, Where is he? which way will he go? and it is a matter of important "news" to be able to say where he is. Jesus says that the Messiah would not come in that manner. It would not be with such pomp and public attention. It would be silent, obscure, and attracting comparatively little notice. Or the passage may have reference to the custom of the "pretended" Messiahs, who appeared in this manner. They said that in this place or in that, in this mountain or that desert, they would show signs that would convince the people that they were the Messiah. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/5-36.htm">Acts 5:36-37</a>.<p>Is within you - This is capable of two interpretations.<p>1. The reign of God is "in the heart." It does not come with pomp and splendor, like the reign of temporal kings, merely to control the external "actions" and strike the senses of people with awe, but it reigns in the heart by the law of God; it sets up its dominion over the passions, and brings every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.<p>2. It may mean the new dispensation is "even now among you." The Messiah has come. John has ushered in the kingdom of God, and you are not to expect the appearance of the Messiah with great pomp and splendor, for he is now among you. Most critics at present incline to this latter interpretation. The ancient versions chiefly follow the former.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

But it has its external side too.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The latter words of this verse seem fairly to admit of a double interpretation, as <span class="ital">you</span> here may signify the disciples of Christ, who had received Christ as their Lord, over whom he exercised a spiritual dominion and jurisdiction, or as it may respect the whole Jewish nation, amongst whom the kingdom of God was now exercised, by the preaching of the gospel, and the power of Christ put forth in the casting out devils, and other miraculous operations. I incline to the latter, as differing from those that think these words were spoken with a peculiar respect to the disciples; I rather think them a reply to the Pharisees, as corrective of their false notion and apprehension of the Messiah, as if he were yet to come, and to set up a temporal principality; for it is said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-22.htm" title="And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.">Luke 17:22</a></span>, And he said unto the disciples, as if he did but then specially apply his discourse to them; en hmin thus signifieth, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-16.htm" title="And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God has visited his people.">Luke 7:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a></span>. You (saith our Saviour) are much mistaken as to the nature of my kingdom, and indeed of the kingdom of the Messiah, in the expectation of which you live. It is not a kingdom of the same nature with the kingdoms of the world, it cometh not with pomp: and splendour, for men and women to observe; they shall not say, Lo here he cometh! Or, Lo there he goeth! The kingdom of God is now in the midst among you, though you observe it not. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Neither shall they say,.... Or shall it be said by any, making their observations, and pointing to this, or that place: <p>lo here, or lo there; in this, or that place, country or city, the kingdom of God is set up; the throne of the Messiah is there; and there are the "regalia", or ensigns of his regal power; no such thing will fall under the observations of man, not but that this would be said, and was said by some persons, as it is suggested it should, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-23.htm">Luke 17:23</a> and it appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-26.htm">Matthew 24:26</a> that some would say he was in such a wilderness, and others, that he was in some private retirement in a house, or that he was in such a town or city; as particularly it was said in Adrian's time, that he was in a place called Bither, where Bar Cochab set up himself for the Messiah: but the sense of the words is, that no such thing ought to be said; and if it was said, it would not be true; nor should it be credited: and the Cambridge copy of Beza's adds, "believe not"; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-26.htm">Matthew 24:26</a><p>for behold the kingdom of God is within you: in the elect of God among the Jews, in their hearts; it being of a spiritual nature, and lying in righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost; in the dispossession of Satan, the strong man armed; in the putting down of the old man, sin, with its deceitful lusts, from the throne; and in setting up a principle of grace, as a governing one; and so escapes the observation of natural men, and cannot be pointed at as here, or there: hence it appears, that the work of grace is an internal thing; it is wrought in the hearts of men; it has its seat in the inward parts, and is therefore called the inner, and the hidden man: it does not lie in words, in an outward profession of religion: it is oil in the vessel of the heart, and is distinct from the lamp of a visible profession; it does not lie in external works and duties, but it is an inward principle of holiness in the soul, or spirit of man, produced there by the Spirit of God, and is therefore called by his name, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a> and it also appears to be a very glorious thing, since it is signified by a kingdom: it is a rich treasure; it is gold tried in the fire, which makes rich; it is an estate, that good part, and portion, which can never be taken away; it is preferable to the greatest portion on earth men can enjoy; even the largest and richest kingdom in the world is not to be compared with it; it is a kingdom which cannot be moved; and as it is glorious in itself, it makes such glorious who are partakers of it: "the king's daughter is all glorious within", <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-13.htm">Psalm 45:13</a> and it is high in the esteem of God; it is the hidden man of the heart, but it is in his sight; it is in his view, and is in his sight of great price: it is likewise evident from hence, that it has great power and authority in the soul; it has the government in it; it reigns, through righteousness, unto eternal life; and by it, Christ, as king of saints, dwells and reigns in his people. Now this is not to be understood of the Scribes and Pharisees, as if they had any such internal principle in them, who were as painted sepulchres, and had nothing but rottenness and corruption in them: but the sense is, that there were some of the people of the Jews, of whom the Pharisees were a part, who had been powerfully wrought upon under the ministry of John, Christ, and his apostles; and were so many instances of efficacious grace, and of the kingdom of God, and of his Gospel coming with power to them. Though the words may be rendered, <p>the kingdom of God is among you; and the meaning be, that the king Messiah was already come, and was among them, and his kingdom was already set up, of which the miracles of Christ were a full proof; and if they could not discern these signs of the times, and evident appearances of the kingdom of God among them, they would never be able to make any observation of it, hereafter, or elsewhere. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> within you.</span><p>(c) You look around for the Messiah as though he were absent, but he is amongst you in the midst of you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/17.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-21.htm" title="Neither shall they say, See here! or, see there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.">Luke 17:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ ἐροῦσι</span>, nor will they say; there will be nothing to give occasion for saying: <span class="ital">non erit quod dicatur</span>, Grotius.—<span class="greekheb">ὧδε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖ</span>, here, there, implying a visible object that can be located.—<span class="greekheb">ἐντὸς ὑμῶν</span>, within you, in your spirit. This rendering best corresponds with the non-visibility of the kingdom. The thought would be a very appropriate one in discourse to <span class="ital">disciples</span>. Not so in discourse to Pharisees. To them it would be most natural to say “<span class="ital">among</span> you” = look around and see my works: devils cast out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-20.htm" title="But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come on you.">Luke 11:20</a>), and learn that the kingdom is already here (<span class="greekheb">ἔφθασεν ἐφʼ ὑμᾶς</span>). Kindred to this rendering is that of Tertullian (<span class="ital">c.</span> <span class="ital">Marcionem</span>, L. iv., 35): in your power, accessible to you: <span class="ital">in manu, in potestate vestra</span>. The idea “among you” would be more clearly expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἤδη ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm" title="There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.">John 1:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">μέσος ὑ</span>. <span class="greekheb">στήκει</span>, etc., one stands among you whom ye know not—cited by Euthy. to illustrate the meaning of our passage. Field (<span class="ital">Ot.

As far as the Greek is concerned, this rendering of <span class="ital">entos</span> is defensible (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-26.htm" title="You blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.">Matthew 23:26</a>), and the spiritual truth expressed by such a rendering— which implies that “the Kingdom of God is...righteousness and peace,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and joy in the Holy Ghost” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm" title="For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.">Romans 14:17</a>)—is most important. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-14.htm" title="But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.">Deuteronomy 30:14</a>. So that Meyer is hardly justified in saying that the conception of the Kingdom of God as an ethical condition of the soul is modem not historico-biblical. But <span class="ital">entos humon</span> may also undoubtedly mean <span class="ital">among you</span> (marg.), ‘in the midst of your ranks,’ as in Xen. <span class="ital">Anab</span>. i. 10, §3; and this rendering is more in accordance (i) with the <span class="ital">context</span>—as to the sudden coming of the Son of Man; and (ii) with the <span class="ital">fact</span>,—for it certainly could not be said that the Kingdom of God was in the hearts of the Pharisees. The meaning then is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-26.htm" title="John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you know not;">John 1:26</a><span class="ital">; </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a>.

The verb put without the noun is consonant with this view.

This true (well-grounded) <span class="ital">Behold</span>, is put in antithesis to the <span class="ital">Behold</span> [“<span class="ital">Lo, here or there</span>”] which is looked for without good ground.[188] <span class="ital">For behold</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἰδοὺ γὰρ</span>) does not belong to (stand under) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΡΟῦΣΙΝ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">they shall say</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐντὸς</span>, <span class="ital">within</span>) Ye ought not to look to times that are future, or places that are remote: for the kingdom of God is within you; even as the King Messiah is in the midst of you: <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-26.htm" title="John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you know not;">John 1:26</a> [“There standeth one among you (<span class="greekheb">μέσος ὑμῶν</span>) whom ye know not”], <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-35.htm" title="Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;">Luke 12:35</a>. <span class="ital">Within</span> is here used, not in respect of the heart of individual Pharisees (although in very deed Christ dwells in the heart of His people: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>), but in respect to the whole Jewish people.

The LXX. use <span class="greekheb">ἐντὸς</span> answering to <span class="greekheb">קרב </span>of those things which are in a man; but in this passage He is speaking of more than one.
