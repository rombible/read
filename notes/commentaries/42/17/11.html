It appears to coincide with the journey of which we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;">Matthew 19:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-1.htm" title="And he arose from there, and comes into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort to him again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.">Mark 10:1</a>, and is the commencement of the last progress through the regions in which our Lord had already carried on His ministry. The fact, peculiar to St. Luke, that it led Him through Samaria, apparently through that part of it which lay on the borders of Galilee, is obviously reported in connection with the miracle that follows, the other Gospels dwelling on the departure from Galilee, and the continuance of the journey to Jerusalem by the route on the east of the Jordan valley.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/luke/17.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Luke<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">WHERE ARE THE NINE?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.">Luke 17:11</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-19.htm" title="And he said to him, Arise, go your way: your faith has made you whole.">Luke 17:19</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The melancholy group of lepers, met with in one of the villages on the borders of Samaria and Galilee, was made up of Samaritans and Jews, in what proportion we do not know. The common misery drove them together, in spite of racial hatred, as, in a flood, wolves and sheep will huddle close on a bit of high ground. Perhaps they had met in order to appeal to Jesus, thinking to move Him by their aggregated wretchedness; or possibly they were permanently segregated from others, and united in a hideous fellowship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. We note the lepers’ cry and the Lord’s strange reply. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Of course they had to stand afar off, and the distance prescribed by law obliged them to cry aloud, though it must have been an effort, for one symptom of leprosy is a hoarse whisper. Sore need can momentarily give strange physical power. Their cry indicates some knowledge. They knew the Lord’s name, and had dim notions of His authority, for He is addressed as Jesus and as Master. They knew that He had power to heal, and they hoped that He had ‘mercy,’ which they might win for themselves by entreaty. There was the germ of trust in the cry forced from them by desperate need. But their conceptions of Him, and their consciousness of their own necessities, did not rise above the purely physical region, and He was nothing to them but a healer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Still, low and rude as their notions were, they did present a point of contact for Christ’s ‘mercy,’ which is ever ready to flow into every heart that is lowly, as water will into all low levels. Jesus seems to have gone near to the lepers, for it was ‘when He saw,’ not when He heard, them that He spoke. It did not become Him to ‘cry, nor cause His voice to be heard in the street,’ nor would He cure as from afar, but He approaches those whom He heals, that they may see His face, and learn by it His compassion and love. His command recognised and honoured the law, but its main purpose, no doubt, was to test, and thereby to strengthen, the leper’s trust. To set out to the priest while they felt themselves full of leprosy would seem absurd, unless they believed that Jesus could and would heal them. He gives no promise to heal, but asks for reliance on an implied promise. He has not a syllable of sympathy; His tender compassion is carefully covered up. He shuts down, as it were, the lantern-slide, and not a ray gets through. But the light was behind the screen all the while. We, too, have sometimes to act on the assumption that Jesus has granted our desires, even while we are not conscious that it is so. We, too, have sometimes to set out, as it were, for the priests, while we still feel the leprosy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. We note the healing granted to obedient faith. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The whole ten set off at once. They had got all they wanted from the Lord, and had no more thought about Him. So they turned their backs on Him. How strange it must have been to feel, as they went along, the gradual creeping of soundness into their bones! How much more confidently they must have stepped out, as the glow of returning health asserted itself more and more! The cure is a transcendent, though veiled, manifestation of Christ’s power; for it is wrought at a distance, without even a word, and with no vehicle. It is simply the silent forth-putting of His power. ‘He spake, and it was done’ is much, for only a word which is divine can affect matter. But ‘He willed, and it was done,’ is even more.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. We note the solitary instance of thankfulness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The nine might have said, ‘We are doing what the Healer bade us do; to go back to Him would be disobedience.’ But a grateful heart knows that to express its gratitude is the highest duty, and is necessary for its own relief. How like us all it is to hurry away clutching our blessings, and never cast back a thought to the giver! This leper’s voice had returned to Him, and his ‘loud’ acknowledgments were very different from the strained croak of his petition for healing. He knew that he had two to thank-God and Jesus; he did not know that these two were one. His healing has brought him much nearer Jesus than before, and now he can fall at His feet. Thankfulness knits us to Jesus with a blessed bond. Nothing is so sweet to a loving heart as to pour itself out in thanks to Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘And he was a Samaritan.’ That may be Luke’s main reason for telling the story, for it corresponds to the universalistic tendency of his Gospel. But may we not learn the lesson that the common human virtues are often found abundantly in nations and individuals against whom we are apt to be deeply prejudiced? And may we not learn another lesson-that heretics and heathen may often teach orthodox believers lessons, not only of courtesy and gratitude, but of higher things? A heathen is not seldom more sensitive to the beauty of Christ, and more touched by the story of His sacrifice, than we who have heard of Him all our days.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. We note Christ’s sad wonder at man’s ingratitude and joyful recognition of ‘this stranger’s’ thankfulness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>A tone of surprise as well as of sadness can be detected in the pathetic double questions. ‘Were not <span class="ital">the</span> ten’-all of them, the ten who stood there but a minute since-’cleansed? but where are the nine?’ Gone off with their gift, and with no spark of thankfulness in their selfish hearts. ‘Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger?’ The numbers of the thankless far surpass those of the thankful. The fewness of the latter surprises and saddens Jesus still. Even a dog knows and will lick the hand that feeds it, but ‘Israel doth not know, My people doth not consider.’ We increase the sweetness of our gifts by thankfulness for them. We taste them twice when we ruminate on them in gratitude. They live after their death when we bless God and thank Jesus for them all. We impoverish ourselves still more than we dishonour Him by the ingratitude which is so crying a fault. One sorrow hides many joys. A single crumpled rose-leaf made the fairy princess’s bed uncomfortable. Some of us can see no blue in our sky if one small cloud is there. Both in regard to earthly and spiritual blessings we are all sinners by unthankfulness, and we all lose much thereby.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Jesus rejoiced over ‘this stranger,’ and gave him a greater gift at last than he had received when the leprosy was cleared from his flesh. Christ’s raising of him up, and sending him on his way to resume his interrupted journey to the priest, was but a prelude to ‘Thy faith hath made thee whole,’ or, as the Revised Version margin reads, ‘saved thee.’ Surely we may take that word in its deepest meaning, and believe that a more fatal leprosy melted out of this man’s spirit, and that the faith which had begun in a confidence that Jesus could heal, and had been increased by obedience to the command which tried it, and had become more awed and enlightened by experience of bodily healing, and been deepened by finding a tongue to express itself in thankfulness, rose at last to such apprehension of Jesus, and such clinging to Him in grateful love, as availed to save ‘this stranger’ with a salvation that healed his spirit, and was perfected when the once leprous body was left behind, to crumble into dust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/17-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee....">Luke 17:11-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee </span>— As Samaria lay between Galilee and Judea, and therefore our Lord, taking his journey to Jerusalem, must go first through Galilee, and then through Samaria, it is inquired why it is here said that he passed <span class="ital">through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. </span>To this Grotius, Whitby, Campbell, and some others, answer, that the original expression, <span class="greekheb">δια μεσου Σαμαριας και Γαλιλαιας</span>, means, <span class="ital">between Samaria and Galilee, </span>or through those parts in which the two countries bordered on each other; or through the confines of them. <span class="ital">There met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off </span>— As lepers were banished from the towns, they were likewise obliged to keep at a distance from the roads which led to them. Curiosity, however, to see the travellers who passed, or, it may be, an inclination to beg, having brought these ten as nigh to the public road as they were permitted to come, they espied Jesus, and cried to him, beseeching him to take pity on them, and cure them. They had heard of some of the great miracles which he had performed, and either knew him personally, having seen him before, or guessed that it might be he by the crowds which followed him. <span class="ital">And he said, Go show yourselves to the priests </span>— Intimating that the cure they desired should be performed by the way. <span class="ital">And as they went </span>— In obedience to his word; <span class="ital">they were cleansed </span>— Namely, by his wonder-working power; the efficacy of which was often exerted on objects at a distance, as well as on such as were near.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:11-19 A sense of our spiritual leprosy should make us very humble whenever we draw near to Christ. It is enough to refer ourselves to the compassions of Christ, for they fail not. We may look for God to meet us with mercy, when we are found in the way of obedience. Only one of those who were healed returned to give thanks. It becomes us, like him, to be very humble in thanksgivings, as well as in prayers. Christ noticed the one who thus distinguished himself, he was a Samaritan. The others only got the outward cure, he alone got the spiritual blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The midst of Samaria and Galilee - He went from Galilee, and probably traveled through the chief villages and towns in it and then left it; and as Samaria was situated "between" Galilee and Jerusalem, it was necessary to pass through it; or it may mean that he passed along on the borders of each toward the river Jordan, and so passed in the midst, "i. e. between" Galilee and Samaria. This is rendered more probable from the circumstance that as he went from Galilee, there would have been no occasion for saying that he passed "through it," unless it be meant through the "confines" or borders of it, or at least it would have been mentioned before Samaria. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 17:11-19.

The leprosy was a sore disease, not so much known in our countries.

A disagreement with Matthew and Mark, who make Him journey through Peraea.

Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-5.htm" title="These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter you not:">Matthew 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2 Kings 17:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-19.htm" title="And he said to him, Arise, go your way: your faith has made you whole.">Luke 17:19</a>. Jesus dismisses the thankful one, giving him, however, to understand what was the <span class="ital">cause</span> of his deliverance—a germ for the further development of his inner life! Thy <span class="ital">faith</span> (in my divine power, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-15.htm" title="And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,">Luke 17:15</a>) hath delivered thee. This faith had not yet the specific <span class="ital">Messianic</span> substance; as yet, Jesus to him was only a divine, miraculously powerful teacher. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-13.htm" title="And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.">Luke 17:13</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[216] According to this understanding Jesus must have journeyed, not southwards, but northwards, which Paulus and Olshausen actually suppose, understanding it of a subordinate journey from Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm" title="Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went there to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.">John 11:54</a>). But this is totally opposed to the direction (<span class="greekheb">εἰς Ἱερουσ</span>.) specified in the context, in respect of which Jesus is wrongly transferred already at <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-38.htm" title="Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.">Luke 10:38</a> to Bethany. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,">Luke 9:51</a>. Schleiermacher’s view of this passage is altogether untenable, as well as that of de Wette, according to whom (comp. Strauss, II. p. 202) the notice is only intended to explain the presence of a <span class="ital">Samaritan</span>, and therefore <span class="greekheb">Σαμαρείας</span> is put first. As though Luke would have written in such a thoughtless mechanical fashion!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[217] If the Samaritan had first been to the priest (Calvin, Schleiermacher), Jesus could not have put the question which He asks at ver. 17 f., since the nine Jews had a much farther journey to the priests. The return of the Samaritan is to be conceived of as very soon after the departure, so that the whole scene took place while still in the village.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/17.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/17-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee....">Luke 17:11-19</a>. <span class="ital">The ten lepers</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11-19.</span> The Cleansed Ten; the Thankless Nine.<span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>11</span>. <span class="ital">as he went to Jerusalem</span>] Rather, as they were on their way.
