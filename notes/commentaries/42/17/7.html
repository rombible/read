They had been asking for faith, not only in a measure sufficient for obedience, but as excluding all uncertainty and doubt. They were looking for the crown of labour before their work was done, for the wreath of the conqueror before they had fought the battle. He presses home upon them the analogies of common human experience. The slave who had been “ploughing” or “feeding <span class= "ital">sheep</span>” (the word is that always used of the shepherd’s work, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-16.htm" title="He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me?

He has first to minister to his master’s wants, to see that his soul is satisfied, and then, in due course, his own turn will come. So, in the life of the disciples, outward ministerial labour was to be followed by personal devotion. In other words, the “increase of faith” for which the Apostles prayed, was to come through obedience, outward and inward obedience, to their Master’s will. Faith was to show itself in virtue, and virtue would bring knowledge, and knowledge would strengthen faith.

They reckoned themselves under no obligation to a servant for doing the duty which his station bound him to perform. In like manner he, their Master, did not reckon himself indebted to them for their services. And therefore, instead of valuing themselves upon what they had done, and expecting great rewards for it, it became them, after having performed all that was commanded them, to think and say that they had done nothing but their duty. <span class="ital">When ye shall have done all, say, We are unprofitable servants </span>— For a man cannot profit God.

Faith in God's pardoning mercy, will enable us to get over the greatest difficulties in the way of forgiving our brethren. As with God nothing is impossible, so all things are possible to him that can believe. Our Lord showed his disciples their need of deep humility. The Lord has such a property in every creature, as no man can have in another; he cannot be in debt to them for their services, nor do they deserve any return from him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having a servant ... - This parable appears to have been spoken with reference to the rewards which the disciples were expecting in the kingdom of the Messiah. The occasion on which it was spoken cannot be ascertained. It does not seem to have any particular connection with what goes before. It may be supposed that the disciples were somewhat impatient to have the kingdom restored to Israel <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a> - that is, that he would assume his kingly power, and that they were impatient of the "delay," and anxious to enter on "the rewards" which they expected, and which they not improbably were expecting in consequence of their devotedness to him. In answer to these expectations, Jesus spoke this parable, showing them,<p>1. That they should be rewarded as a servant would be provided for; but,<p>2. That this was not the "first" thing; that there was a proper "order" of things, and that thus the reward might be delayed, as a servant would be provided for, but at the proper time, and at the pleasure of the master; and,<p>3. That this reward was not to be expected as a matter of "merit," but would be given at the good pleasure of God, for they were but unprofitable servants.<p>By and by - This should have been translated "immediately." He would not, "as the first thing," or "as soon" as he returned from the field, direct him to eat and drink. Hungry and weary he might be, yet it would be proper for him first to attend upon his master. So the apostles were not to be "impatient" because they did not "at once" receive the reward for which they were looking.<p>To meat - To eat; or, rather, place thyself at the table. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-10. say unto him by and by&#8212;The "by and by" (or rather "directly") should be joined not to the saying but the going: "Go directly." The connection here is: "But when your faith has been so increased as both to avoid and forgive offenses, and do things impossible to all but faith, be not puffed up as though you had laid the Lord under any obligations to you."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. <span class="bld">7-10 Lu 17:7-9</span> are plainly a parable, a part of a discourse wherein our Lord, under an earthly similitude, instructs us in a spiritual duty. This duty is easily learned from the <span class="ital">epiparabole, </span> <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-10.htm" title="So likewise you, when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.">Luke 17:10</a></span>, and it lieth in two things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That we ought to do all those things which our Lord hath commanded us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That we, when we have done all, are to look for our reward, not of debt, but of grace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He illustrates this by a similitude or parable. He supposes a man to have a servant ploughing or feeding cattle for him. By <span class="bld">servants</span> we must understand such servants as they had in those countries, who were not day servants, or covenant servants, who are only obliged to work their hours, or according to their contracts with us; but such servants as were most usual amongst them, who were bought with their money, or taken in war, who were wholly at their master’s command, and all their time was their master’s, and they were obliged by their labour only to serve him: such servants our Lord supposes to have been abroad in the field, ploughing, or sowing, or feeding cattle, and at night to be come in from their labour. He asks them which of them would think themselves obliged presently to set them to supper, (for meat, drink, and clothes were all such servants wages), or would not rather set them to work again, to make ready their master’s supper, and then to wait upon him, tying up their long garments, which they used in those countries to wear, promising them that afterwards also they should eat and drink. And suppose they do that without murmuring, he asketh them again, whether they would take themselves obliged to thank them for doing the things which their master commanded? He tells them he supposes they would not take themselves to be under any such obligation. Now what is the meaning of <span class="bld">all this he tells them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-10.htm" title="So likewise you, when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.">Luke 17:10</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; </span> for the infinitely glorious and blessed God can receive no benefit by our services; <span class="bld">we have done that which was our duty to do.</span> By which we are instructed, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That we are wholly the Lord’s, all our time, strength, abilities; we are obliged to love the Lord with all our heart, and mind, and soul, and strength. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That our labour for the Lord must not cease till the Lord ceaseth commanding, till we have done all that the Lord by his revealed will lets us know we have to do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That when we have done all we shall have merited nothing at God’s hands; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a) Because we are servants. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>b) Because we have but done our duty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That the Lord may delay our reward till we have done all that he hath commanded us. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. That when we have it, it is not a reward of thanks, but of grace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This parable is excellently added to the former discourses. Our Saviour had before pressed the doctrine of charity, he had also showed what must be the root of it, viz. true and lively faith; he here showeth us what we should propose to ourselves as our end in such acts, viz. not to merit at the hand of God, not merely in hope to receive a reward from him, but the glorifying of God by a faithful obedience to his will, owning him as our Lord, and ourselves as his servants, without any vain glory or ostentation, and in all humility confessing ourselves servants, unprofitable servants, and such as have but done our duty, no, though we had done all that he commanded us; waiting for our reward with patience, and taking it at last as of his free grace with thankfulness; which is indeed requisite to the true and regular performance of every good work which we do, and our duty, if the infirmity of our flesh would allow us to do all whatsoever God hath commanded us; but much more when our performances are so lame and imperfect, that the greatest part of what we do amounts not to the least part of what we leave undone. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But which of you having a servant ploughing,.... In order to keep the disciples humble in the performance of such miraculous works; and that they might not imagine they could have any thing at the hands of God by merit; and to excite them to go on from one duty to another; and never think they have done, or done enough, or more than what is their duty, Christ delivers the following parable. <p>Which of you having a servant ploughing, or feeding cattle; or "sheep", as the Syriac and Persic versions render it; or a "ploughman", or a "shepherd", as the Ethiopic version; which are both servile works, and done in the field: not that the disciples had any such servants under them, though the words are directed to them, for they had left all, and followed Christ; nor were they brought up to husbandry, but most of them in the fishing trade; Christ only puts this for instance, and supposes such a case: <p>will say unto him by and by; or straightway, immediately, directly, <p>when he is come from the field; and has done ploughing, and feeding his cattle, sheep, or cows, or whatever they are; as soon as ever he comes home; or "first", as the Persic version; the first thing he shall say to him, upon his return from thence, <p>go; to the other side of the room, and to the table there ready spread, and furnished; or "go up", as the Arabic and Ethiopic versions render it; go up to the upper room where they used to dine or sup; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-12.htm">Luke 22:12</a> or "come in", as the Persic version renders it; and which some learned men observe, is the sense of the Greek word here used; come into the house, <p>and sit down to meat? or fall, and lie down on the couch, as was the custom in those countries at eating. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</span><p>(4) Seeing that God may rightfully claim for himself both us and all that is ours, he cannot be indebted to us for anything, although we labour mightily until we die.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/luke/17.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/17-7.htm" title="But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?...">Luke 17:7-10</a>.

The point of view of this predicate[215] is, according to the context (see what follows), this, that the <span class="ital">profit</span> does not begin until the servant goes beyond his obligation. If he do <span class="ital">less</span> than his obligation, he is <span class="ital">hurtful</span>; if he <span class="ital">come up to</span> his duty, it is true he has caused no damage, but still neither has he achieved any positive <span class="greekheb">χρεία</span>, an must hence acknowledge himself a <span class="greekheb">δοῦλος ἀχρεῖος</span>, who as being such has no claims to make on his Lord for praise and reward. Judged by this ethical standard, the <span class="greekheb">χρεία</span> lies <span class="ital">beyond</span> the point of duty, for the coming up to this point simply averts the <span class="ital">damage</span> which, arising from the <span class="ital">defect</span> of performance, would otherwise accrue. The impossibility, however, even of coming up to this point not only excludes all <span class="ital">opera supererogativa</span>, but, moreover, cutting off <span class="ital">all</span> merit of works, forms the ethical foundation of justification by <span class="ital">faith</span>. The meaning “<span class="ital">worthless</span>” (J. Müller, <span class="ital">v. d. Sünde</span>, I. p. 74) is not the signification of the word (any more than in LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-22.htm" title="And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in my own sight: and of the maidservants which you have spoken of, of them shall I be had in honor.">2 Samuel 6:22</a>, <span class="greekheb">שָׁפָל</span>), but it follows at once from this. Moreover, the passage before us does not stand in contradiction to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-37.htm" title="Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he comes shall find watching: truly I say to you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.">Luke 12:37</a>, since the absence of merit on the part of man, by which Jesus here desires to <span class="ital">humble</span> him, does not exclude the divine reward of grace, by which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-37.htm" title="Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he comes shall find watching: truly I say to you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.">Luke 12:37</a> He <span class="ital">encourages</span> him.

The groundwork that lies underneath great faith and prayer is lowly poverty of spirit, and a profound sense of our <span class="greekheb">ἀχρειότης</span>, <span class="ital">unprofitableness</span>, and of the debt of duty we owe Him. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-11.htm" title="The LORD takes pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.">Psalm 147:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-2.htm" title="Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait on the LORD our God, until that he have mercy on us.">Psalm 123:2</a>, [“Behold as the eyes of <span class="ital">servants</span> look unto the hands of their masters, etc., so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until He have <span class="ital">mercy</span> upon us.”]—<span class="greekheb">ἀροτριῶντα</span>, <span class="ital">plowing</span>) during the whole day: whence there follows, <span class="greekheb">δειπνήσω</span>, “wherewith I may have <span class="ital">supper</span>” [the meal at <span class="ital">the close of the day</span>].—<span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span>, <span class="ital">forthwith, quickly</span>) In antithesis to <span class="greekheb">μετὰ ταῦτα</span>, <span class="ital">afterwards</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-8.htm" title="And will not rather say to him, Make ready with which I may sup, and gird yourself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward you shall eat and drink?">Luke 17:8</a>. Therefore we should construe <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἀνάπεσε</span>, <span class="ital">forthwith sit down to meat</span>. Others [as the Engl. Ver., “will say unto him by and by,”] join <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐρεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">will forthwith say</span>, which gives a rather ax sense. For whether the master says this or that to the servant, he says it ‘forthwith,’ as soon as ever the servant hath come in from the field. But those persons wish <span class="ital">forthwith</span> or <span class="ital">quickly</span> to sit down to meat, who after they have laid aside all their other duties, fancy that the highest degree of faith should be ascribed to them, [“Qui missis cæteris officiis fidem sibi summam conferri oportere putant.”] Whereas they please God, who walk modestly, and demand nothing in a spirit of arrogance.—<span class="greekheb">παρελθὼν</span>, <span class="ital">go forward and</span>) See note, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-37.htm" title="Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he comes shall find watching: truly I say to you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.">Luke 12:37</a>—<span class="greekheb">ἀνάπεσε</span>) Others read <span class="greekheb">ἀνάπεσαι</span>.

They were asking for a boon he would not, nay, could not, grant them yet. A small measure of <span class="accented">real</span> faith was sufficient to teach them that God would give them strength enough to keep themselves from committing this offence against love and charity of which he warned them so solemnly; but they prayed for more. "They were asking for faith, not only in a measure sufficient for obedience, but for a faith which would exclude all uncertainty and doubt. They were looking for the crown of labour <span class="accented">before</span> their work was done, for the wreath of the conqueror <span class="accented">before</span> they had fought the battle...  In other words, the 'increase of faith' 'for which the apostles prayed was only to come through obedience to their Master's will" (Dean Plumptre). The little parable was to teach them that they were not to look to accomplishing great things by a strong faith given to them in a moment of time, but they were to labour on patiently and bravely, and <span class="accented">afterwards</span>, as in the parable-story, <span class="accented">they too should eat and drink.</span> It was to show them that in the end they should receive that higher faith they prayed for, which was to be the reward for patient, gallant toil. <span class="accented">And gird thyself, and serve me.</span> It is scarcely wise, as we have before remarked, to press each separate detail of the Lord's parables. Zeller, quoted by Stier," makes, however, an application of this to the 'inner world of the heart,' in which there is no going straightway to sit down at table when a man comes from his external calling and sphere of labour, but we must gird ourselves to serve the Lord, and so prepare ourselves for the time when he will receive us to his supper." This is interesting, but it is doubtful if the Lord intended these special applications. The general sense of the parable is clear. It teaches two things to all who would be, then or in the ages to come, his disciples - <span class="accented">patience</span> and <span class="accented">humility.</span> It reminds men, too, that his service is an arduous one, and that for those really engaged in it it not only brings hard toil in  the fields during the day, but also further duties often in the evening-tide. There is no rest for the faithful and true servant of Jesus, and this restless work must be <span class="accented">patiently</span> gone through, perhaps for long years. </body></html>
