The former feeling had been described before, when the disciples were told that the children of the bride-chamber should fast when the Bridegroom should be taken from them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-34.htm" title="And he said to them, Can you make the children of the bridal chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?">Luke 5:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-15.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.">Matthew 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-19.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.">Mark 2:19</a>). The latter was expressed by-one of those who were now listening, when he spoke of men as “looking for and eagerly hasting” the coming of the day of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2Peter 3:12</a>); by another, when he recorded the cry of the souls beneath the altar, “How long, O Lord?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm" title="And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?">Revelation 6:10</a>). It is, we must re member, the disciples, and not the Pharisees, who are now addressed. In the long, weary years of conflict that lay before them, they would often wish that they could be back again in the pleasant days of friendly converse in the old Galilean life, or that they could be carried forward to the day of the final victory. Analogous emotions of both kinds have, of course, been felt by the successors of the disciples in all ages of the Church. They ask, Why the former days were better than the latter? (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-10.htm" title="Say not you, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for you do not inquire wisely concerning this.">Ecclesiastes 7:10</a>); they ask also, in half-murmuring impatience, “Why tarry the wheels of His chariots?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm" title="The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?">Judges 5:28</a>); sometimes, even in the accents of unbelief, “Where is the promise of His coming?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm" title="And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.">2Peter 3:4</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/17-22.htm" title="And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it....">Luke 17:22-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man </span>— One day of mercy, or one day wherein you might converse with me, as you do now. Having spoken to the Pharisees, he now addressed his disciples, and in the hearing of the Pharisees prophesied concerning the destruction of the Jewish state, whose constitution, both religious and civil, was the chief obstacle to the erection of his kingdom; for the attachment which the Jews had to their constitution was the spring of all their opposition to Christianity, and of their cruelty to its abetters. A prediction of this nature, delivered as the continuation of his answer to the Pharisees, who desired to know when Messiah’s kingdom should come, plainly signified, that it would first become conspicuous in the destruction of the Jewish commonwealth. But because love and compassion were eminent parts of our Lord’s character, he spake of that dreadful catastrophe in such a manner as might be most profitable to his hearers. He told them, first of all, that they and the whole nation should be in the greatest distress before the destruction of their constitution, and the full establishment of Messiah’s kingdom; and that they should passionately wish for Messiah’s personal presence to comfort them under their afflictions, but should not be favoured with it. Next he cautioned them against the deceivers which, in that time of universal distress, would arise, pretending to be the Messiah, and promising to deliver the people from the powers which oppressed them. He told them, that these deceivers would lurk a while in private, till, by the diligence of their emissaries spreading abroad their fame, and exhorting the people to go out to them, they had gathered a force sufficient to support them. <span class="ital">They shall say to you, See here, or see there; go not after them </span>— Do not go forth to them, nor follow them, for by this mark you shall know them to be deceivers. <span class="ital">For as the lightning, &c., shall the Son of man be in his day </span>— So manifest, so swift, so wide, so irresistible, so awful in its consequences shall his coming be. He shall come, indeed, but in a manner very different from that in which the generality of this people expect him, even to execute a sudden and unavoidable destruction upon his enemies, and establish his religion and government in a great part of the world.

It was a spiritual kingdom, set up in the heart by the power of Divine grace. Observe how it had been with sinners formerly, and in what state the judgments of God, which they had been warned of, found them. Here is shown what a dreadful surprise this destruction will be to the secure and sensual. Thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. When Christ came to destroy the Jewish nation by the Roman armies, that nation was found in such a state of false security as is here spoken of. In like manner, when Jesus Christ shall come to judge the world, sinners will be found altogether regardless; for in like manner the sinners of every age go on securely in their evil ways, and remember not their latter end. But wherever the wicked are, who are marked for eternal ruin, they shall be found by the judgments of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>(The days will come He here takes occasion to direct the minds of his disciples to the days of vengeance which were about to fall on the Jewish nation.

At present the Bridegroom was with them, and they could not mourn; for many years after that he was departed from them <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the days of the Son of man</span> continued, that is, gospel days, times wherein the gospel of Christ was freely preached to them.

Every factious person that had reputation enough to make himself the head and leader of a faction, taking his advantage of the common error of the Jews, that a Messiah, a Christ, was to come, who should exercise a temporal kingdom over the Jews, would pretend to be, and give out he was, the Messiah, to draw a faction after him. This is that which our Saviour saith in the next words. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto his disciples,.... Who also were expecting a worldly kingdom, and external honours, and temporal emoluments, and riches; and therefore to take off their minds from these things, and that they might not have their expectations raised this way, but, on the other hand, look for afflictions and persecutions, he observes to them, <p>the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man; , "the days of the Messiah", a phrase frequently used in Jewish writings; that is, when they should be glad to enjoy one such a day in the personal presence of Christ, as they now did; and instead of looking forward for happy days, in a temporal sense, they would look back upon the days they have enjoyed with Christ, when he was in person among them, and wish they had one of those days again; when besides his corporeal presence, and spiritual communion with him, and the advantage of his ministry and miracles, they bad much outward peace and comfort: whereas in those days nothing but afflictions and persecutions abode them, wherever they went; so that by these words Christ would have them to understand, that they were not to expect better times, but worse, and that they would be glad of one of the days they now had, and in vain wish for it: <p>and ye shall not see it, or enjoy it. Moreover, days and opportunities of public worship, of praying to the Lord, of singing his praise, of hearing his word, and of attending on his ordinances, may be called days of the son of man, or Lord's days; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a> even the first days of weeks, on which days the apostles, and primitive churches, met together for religious worship: and these may very well be called days of the son of man, since, on those days, he first appeared to his disciples, after his resurrection, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a> and on the same days his disciples and followers met together to preach in his name, to hear his Gospel, and to commemorate his sufferings and death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a> and still continue to do so; and seeing he often meets with his people at such seasons and opportunities, fills them with his Spirit, communicates his grace, and indulges them with fellowship with himself, which make those days desirable ones: but sometimes so violent has been the persecution of the saints, that they have not been able, for a long time, to enjoy one of those days openly, and with freedom, though greatly desired by them; which may be considered as a fulfilment, at least in part, of this prediction of our Lord's: and therefore, whenever this is the case, it should not be thought strange; it is no other than what Christ has foretold should be: and it may teach us to prize, make use of, and improve such days and opportunities, whilst we have them, we know not how soon our teachers may be removed into corners, when we shall wish in vain for them; and seasons of hearing them, as is here suggested: sad it is to know the worth of Gospel opportunities, by the want of them! <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see <i>it</i>.</span><p>(8) We often neglect those things when they are present which we afterward desire when they are gone, but in vain.<p>(d) The time will come when you will seek for the Son of Man with great sorrow of heart, and will not find him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/luke/17.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-22.htm" title="And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.">Luke 17:22</a>.
