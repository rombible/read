Assuming the words to have been repeated where we find them here, the “little ones” must mean the disciples of Christ who are, in both senses of the word “offended” by the worldliness of those who profess to be religious. They are made to stumble by the temptation to follow the bad example, or their faith in the reality of godliness is shaken by seeing that the form exists without the power.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-10 It is no abatement of their guilt by whom an offence comes, nor will it lessen their punishment that offences will come. Faith in God's pardoning mercy, will enable us to get over the greatest difficulties in the way of forgiving our brethren. As with God nothing is impossible, so all things are possible to him that can believe. Our Lord showed his disciples their need of deep humility. The Lord has such a property in every creature, as no man can have in another; he cannot be in debt to them for their services, nor do they deserve any return from him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is impossible - It cannot but happen.

The realistic expression of Mt. is doubtless truer to the actual utterance of Jesus, who would speak of the offences created by ambition with passionate abhorrence.—<span class="greekheb">περίκειται</span> = perf. pass. of <span class="greekheb">περιτίθημι</span> in sense = has been placed; with <span class="greekheb">ἔρριπται</span>, another perfect, suggesting the idea of an action already complete—the miscreant with a stone round his neck thrown into the sea.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν</span>: here again a subdued expression compared with Mt.—<span class="greekheb">ἢ ἵνα σκανδαλίσῃ</span>, than to scandalise; the subj. with <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> = the infinitive. <span class="ital">Vide</span> Winer, § 44, 8.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">It were better for him,</span> &c.] The literal rendering of the verse is “It is for his advantage if a millstone <span class="ital">is hanging</span> round his neck, and <span class="ital">he has been flung</span> into the sea, rather than that, &c.” In other words, the fate of a man who is lying drowned at the bottom of the sea is better than if his continuance in life would have led to causing “one of these little ones” to stumble.

The reference is not to children, or the young, though of course the warning applies no less to their case; but primarily to publicans and weak believers. Christ calls even the Apostles ‘children, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm" title="Little children, yet a little while I am with you.
