It is to them as a tale that is told them, not as a message that is sent to them. Observe the duties taught and recommended to us by the history of the paralytic. In applying to Christ, we must be very pressing and urgent; that is an evidence of faith, and is very pleasing to Christ, and prevailing with him. Give us, Lord, the same kind of faith with respect to thy ability and willingness to heal our souls. Give us to desire the pardon of sin more than any earthly blessing, or life itself. Enable us to believe thy power to forgive sins; then will our souls cheerfully arise and go where thou pleasest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tiling - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1-7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. housetop&#8212;the flat roof.<p>through the tiling &#8230; before Jesus&#8212;(See on [1575]Mr 2:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-18.htm" title="And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.">Luke 5:18</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when they could not find by what way,....

Eastern houses are often only one storey high, and when they are built on rising ground, the roof is often nearly on a level with the street above.

But the description is too vague to enable us to understand the details. Sceptical writers have raised difficulties about it in order to discredit the whole narrative (comp. Cic. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-18.htm" title="For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me.">Php 2:18</a></span>, “per tegulas demitterere”), but the making of an aperture in the roof is an everyday matter in the East (Thomson, <span class="ital">The Land and the Book</span>, p. 358), and is here alluded to, not because it was strange, but to illustrate the active, and as it were nobly impatient, faith of the man and the bearers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with his couch</span>] <span class="ital">klinidion</span>, ‘little bed,’ probably a mere mat or mattress.
