Strong confidence and deep humility are united in the words of this leper. And if any sinner, from a deep sense of vileness, says, I know the Lord can cleanse, but will he look upon such a one as me? will he apply his own precious blood for my cleansing and healing? Yes, he will. Speak not as doubting, but as humbly referring the matter to Christ. And being saved from the guilt and power of our sins, let us spread abroad Christ's fame, and bring others to hear him and to be healed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2-4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 5:12-16.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-35.htm" title="And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the middle, he came out of him, and hurt him not.">Luke 4:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-14.htm" title="And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.">Luke 5:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-56.htm" title="And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done.">Luke 8:56</a>. The reasons were probably (i) personal to the healed sufferer, lest his inward thankfulness should be dissipated by the idle and boastful gossip of curiosity (St Chrys.), but far more (ii) because, as St Matthew expressly tells us, He did not wish His ministry to be accompanied by excitement and tumult, in accordance with the prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-2.htm" title="He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.">Isaiah 42:2</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-15.htm" title="But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from there: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;...">Matthew 12:15-50</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:...">Php 2:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-5.htm" title="So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said to him, You are my Son, to day have I begotten you.">Hebrews 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm" title="Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.">John 18:36</a>); and (iii) because He came, not merely and not mainly, to be a great Physician and Wonder-worker, but to save men’s souls by His Revelation, His Example, and His Death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is evident however that there was something very special in this case, for St Mark says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-43.htm" title="And what is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?">Luke 1:43</a>), “violently enjoining him, immediately He thrust him forth, and said to him, <span class="ital">See that</span> you say no more to any one” (according to the right reading and translation). Clearly, although the multitudes were following Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-1.htm" title="When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.">Matthew 8:1</a>), He was walking before them, and the miracle had been so sudden and instantaneous (<span class="greekheb">ἰδοὺ</span> … <span class="greekheb">εὐθέως</span>) that they had not observed what had taken place. Probably our Lord desired to avoid the Levitical rites for uncleanness which the unspiritual ceremonialism of the Pharisees might have tried to force upon Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On other occasions, when these reasons did not exist, He even enjoined the publication of an act of mercy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-39.htm" title="Return to your own house, and show how great things God has done to you. And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done to him.">Luke 8:39</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but go, and shew thyself to the priest</span>] We find similar instances of transition from indirect to direct narration, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-22.htm" title="So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See you tell no man that you have showed these things to me.">Acts 23:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-16.htm" title="The day is yours, the night also is yours: you have prepared the light and the sun.">Psalm 74:16</a>. See my <span class="ital">Brief Greek Syntax</span>, p. 196. The priest alone could legally <span class="ital">pronounce</span> him clean.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">offer for thy cleansing</span>] The student should read for himself the intensely interesting and symbolic rites commanded by Moses for the legal pronunciation of a leper clean in Leviticus 14. They occupy fourteen chapters of <span class="ital">Negaîm</span>, one of the treatises of the Mishnah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according as Moses commanded</span>] A reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/14-4.htm" title="Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:...">Leviticus 14:4-10</a> will shew how heavy an expense the offering entailed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for a testimony unto them</span>] i. e. that the priests may assure themselves that the miracle is real. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-5.htm" title="And whoever will not receive you, when you go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.">Luke 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-11.htm" title="And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when you depart there, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.">Mark 6:11</a> the words mean ‘for a witness <span class="ital">against</span> them.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he charged him to tell no man</span>. We find this desire of Jesus to check publicity after he had worked one of his great works, especially in the earlier part of his ministry. Chrysostom attributes this to the Master's regard for the one who had been healed, desiring that his gratitude to God for the mercy vouchsafed to him should not be frittered away in words, in idle talk with curious persons. It is, however, more likely that the Master wished to stem rather than to fan the tide of popularity which such mighty works would be sure to excite among the people. What he determined to check was a false and mistaken desire among the people to make him king. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He charged (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>A strong word, often of military orders.
