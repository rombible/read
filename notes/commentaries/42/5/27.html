He left the house, therefore, immediately. But on his going out the people accompanied him, eager to hear him preach. This good disposition which they were in, Jesus improved to their advantage. He went with them to the lake, and on the shore preached to a great multitude, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-13.htm" title="And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.">Mark 2:13</a>. When he had made an end of speaking, he passed by <span class="ital">the receipt of custom, </span>or booth, where the collectors of the tax waited to levy it, possibly from the vessels which used the port of Capernaum. Here he saw a publican, Matthew or Levi, (for it was a common thing among the Jews for a person to have two names,) sitting, whom he ordered to follow him, and who immediately obeyed, being designed of God for a more honourable employment than that of collecting the taxes. Matthew, thinking himself highly honoured by this call, made a <span class="ital">great feast, </span>or entertainment, for Jesus and his disciples, inviting, at the same time, as many of his brother publicans as he could, hoping that Christ’s conversation might bring them to repentance. In this action, therefore, Matthew showed both gratitude and charity; gratitude to Christ who had now called him, and charity to his acquaintance in labouring to bring about their conversion.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:27-39 It was a wonder of Christ's grace, that he would call a publican to be his disciple and follower. It was a wonder of his grace, that the call was made so effectual. It was a wonder of his grace, that he came to call sinners to repentance, and to assure them of pardon. It was a wonder of his grace, that he so patiently bore the contradiction of sinners against himself and his disciples. It was a wonder of his grace, that he fixed the services of his disciples according to their strength and standing. The Lord trains up his people gradually for the trials allotted them; we should copy his example in dealing with the weak in faith, or the tempted believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-9.htm">Matthew 9:9-13</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 5:27-32.

There was nothing more ordinary amongst the Jews than for persons to have two names. Mark tells us his father’s name also, saying he was the son of Alphaeus. All agree in his employment, that he was a publican, one employed in the gathering of the public revenue, that part of it which arose from the exportation and importation of commodities; for he was sitting at the receipt of custom. Christ from thence calls him; he follows him, that is, gave up his name to be his disciple; in gratitude, Matthew, or Levi, invites him to a feast, and with him several other publicans and others. The other two evangelists say nothing of Matthew’s preparing this feast; but it is implied in them, for they take notice of his sitting at meat in his house, and of the offence taken at it by the scribes and the Pharisees, and of our Saviour’s taking notice of it, and what he said in justification of himself: see the notes before mentioned above.

He says that this should be as little expected as that any one when he has drunk old wine should long for new, since he finds that the old is better. So in substance Theophylact, Euthymius Zigabenus, Erasmus, Clarius, Zeger, Calovius, Wolf, Bengel, Paulus, Olshausen, Lange, and others;[94] and rightly, since even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-37.htm" title="And no man puts new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.">Luke 5:37</a> f. the contrast of the old and new wine typified the contrasted old and new theocratic life. Hence we are neither, with Wetstein, to suppose the meaning reversed: “Pharisaeorum austeritas comparator vino novo, Christi lenitas vino veteri;” nor, with Grotius (comp. Estius and Clericus), to interpret: “Homines non subito ad austeriorem vitam pertrahendos, sed per gradus quosdam assuefaciendos esse” (Jesus, in truth, <span class="ital">had no wish</span> to accustom them to an “austeriorem vitam!”); nor, with Schegg, to substitute the meaning: “that not till the old wine is expended (in reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-35.htm" title="But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.">Luke 5:35</a>) is the new drunk (which refers to fasts, etc., as a remedy for their being deprived of the presence of Christ).” But by the objection that the old wine is actually better (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/9-10.htm" title="Forsake not an old friend; for the new is not comparable to him: a new friend is as new wine; when it is old, thou shalt drink it with pleasure.">Sir 9:10</a>, and see Wolf and Wetstein) the parable is unduly pressed (in opposition to de Wette and others), since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/5-37.htm" title="And no man puts new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish....">Luke 5:37-39</a> the point of comparison is not the quality of the wine in itself, but the <span class="ital">relation of the old and the new</span>. Outside the point of comparison, <span class="ital">every</span> parable is apt to be at fault. Moreover, <span class="greekheb">χρηστός</span> denotes the <span class="ital">agreeable delicious taste</span>. Comp. Plut. <span class="ital">Mor</span>. p. 240 D, 1073 A. The new has, as it were, no <span class="ital">taste</span> if the old has been found agreeable. But <span class="ital">irony</span> is as little to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-39.htm" title="No man also having drunk old wine straightway desires new: for he said, The old is better.">Luke 5:39</a> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-37.htm" title="And no man puts new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.">Luke 5:37</a> f., and the <span class="ital">gentle</span> exculpatory character of the discourse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-39.htm" title="No man also having drunk old wine straightway desires new: for he said, The old is better.">Luke 5:39</a> (which must in no wise be taken to mean full approval, in opposition to Hilgenfeld in the <span class="ital">Theol.

See on Matthew. Comp. also Volkmar, <span class="ital">Evang. Marcions</span>, p. 219 ff. If in the two parables it were desired to abide by the <span class="ital">general</span> thought of <span class="ital">unsuitableness</span> (as it would be unsuitable to pour new wine into old skins, and after old wine immediately to drink new; so also it would be unsuitable if my disciples desired to bind themselves to the old institutions), the figure of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-39.htm" title="No man also having drunk old wine straightway desires new: for he said, The old is better.">Luke 5:39</a> would be very much <span class="ital">out of harmony</span> with the appropriate figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-38.htm" title="But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.">Luke 5:38</a>, and the unsuitable matter would at <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-39.htm" title="No man also having drunk old wine straightway desires new: for he said, The old is better.">Luke 5:39</a> be represented in direct <span class="ital">contradiction to fact</span> (in opposition to de Wette); apart from this, moreover, that <span class="greekheb">θέλει</span> (not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΊΝΕΙ</span></span></span>) applies the saying <span class="ital">subjectively</span>.

The name Matthew (probably a corruption of Mattihijah) means, like Nathanael, Theodore, Doritheus, Adeodatus, &c., ‘the gift of God,’ and it seems to have been the name which he himself adopted after his call (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-9.htm" title="And as Jesus passed forth from there, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him, Follow me.

For the Herods were mere creatures of the Caesars (Jos. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xvii. 11 § 6). Probably the ‘custom’ was connected with the traffic of the Lake, and in the Hebrew Gospel of St Matthew ‘publican’ is rendered ‘<span class="ital">Baal abarah</span>’ ‘lord of the passage.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-27.htm" title="And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him, Follow me.">Luke 5:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐθεάσατο</span>, <span class="ital">He beheld</span>) with compassion.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-29.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">calf of Levi</span> (<span class="accented">Matthew the publican</span>), <span class="accented">and the feast that followed.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me</span>. Capernaum, as has been already noticed, had become, owing to its situation, a commercial centre of no small importance. It was on the great highway from the interior of Asia, and from Damascus to the seaboard Mediterranean cities, to Jerusalem, and to Egypt. The custom-house of Capernaum and the office of inland revenue there would naturally be under the control of officials of some importance. The local trade on the lake, too, we know at that period was very large. It has been frequently asked - What specially induced our Lord to select as one of his inner circle a man whose life-work was so hateful and unpopular to the Jewish people generally? why did he include in the twelve one who, from the nature of his detested office, had lost religious caste among the Jews, and who was compelled to consort with sinners, Gentiles, and persons who were considered, either from their birth or life and associations, outside the pale of the chosen people? Various replies to this question have been suggested, such as - by this open act he threw down the gauntlet to all that powerful Pharisee class who were beginning to suspect and to mistake his teaching and liberalism. Or was his apparently strange choice dictated by a simple desire to have, in the inner circle of his devoted friends, a business man - one who could manage the affairs and regulate the economy of the little growing society? but this seems to have been done by Judas; or was it simply done in obedience to a sudden impulse from on High? None of these seems satisfactory. Surely another motive, and that a deeper  and a nobler one, suggested this enrolment of the despised publican in that glorious company of apostles. The Lord was determined to show, by this choice of his, that in his eyes all callings were equally honourable, all ways of life might lead to the city of the blessed. Never would the work ennoble the man, but only the way in which the work was done. The Baptist, as we have seen, first taught this Divine liberalism. The Baptist's Lord placed his seal of approval upon his servant's teaching by such acts as the calling of Matthew the publican, and feasting in his house with publicans and sinners. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He saw (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>Better, as Rev., beheld, since the verb denotes looking attentively.
