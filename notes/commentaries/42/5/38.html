It was a wonder of his grace, that the call was made so effectual. It was a wonder of his grace, that he came to call sinners to repentance, and to assure them of pardon. It was a wonder of his grace, that he so patiently bore the contradiction of sinners against himself and his disciples. It was a wonder of his grace, that he fixed the services of his disciples according to their strength and standing. The Lord trains up his people gradually for the trials allotted them; we should copy his example in dealing with the weak in faith, or the tempted believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage illustrated in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14-17</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 5:33-39. Fasting.<p>(See on [1577]Mt 9:14-17.)<p>The incongruities mentioned in Lu 5:36-38 were intended to illustrate the difference between the genius of the old and new economies, and the danger of mixing up the one with the other. As in the one case supposed, "the rent is made worse," and in the other, "the new wine is spilled," so by a mongrel mixture of the ascetic ritualism of the old with the spiritual freedom of the new economy, both are disfigured and destroyed. The additional parable in Lu 5:39, which is peculiar to Luke, has been variously interpreted. But the "new wine" seems plainly to be the evangelical freedom which Christ was introducing; and the old, the opposite spirit of Judaism: men long accustomed to the latter could not be expected "straightway"&#8212;all at once&#8212;to take a liking for the former; that is, "These inquiries about the difference between My disciples and the Pharisees," and even John's, are not surprising; they are the effect of a natural revulsion against sudden change, which time will cure; the new wine will itself in time become old, and so acquire all the added charms of antiquity. What lessons does this teach, on the one hand, to those who unreasonably cling to what is getting antiquated; and, on the other, to hasty reformers who have no patience with the timidity of their weaker brethren!   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-33.htm" title="And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but your eat and drink?">Luke 5:33</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But new wine must be put into new bottles,.... Such as the disciples of Christ were, and sinners called to repentance are, who are renewed by the Spirit and grace of God: and these are filled with spiritual joy and comfort, as with new wine, arising from discoveries of the love of God, a view of interest in the blessings of the covenant, and an application of Gospel truths and promises. <p>And both are preserved; both these renewed ones, who are preserved unto the kingdom and glory of Christ; and the grace that is put into them, which is a well of living water, springing up to everlasting life; as well as the Gospel, and its blessings. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-38.htm" title="But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.">Luke 5:38</a> gives the positive side of the truth answering to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-17.htm" title="Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runs out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.">Matthew 9:17</a> b, only substituting the verbal adjective <span class="greekheb">βλητέον</span> for <span class="greekheb">βάλλουσιν</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">38</span>. <span class="ital">new wine … into new bottles</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">new</span> (<span class="greekheb">νέος</span>) <span class="bld">wine into fresh</span> (<span class="greekheb">καινοὺς</span>) <span class="bld">wine-skins</span>.
