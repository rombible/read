See a like form of expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>. Some commentators imagine that self- righteous persons are here spoken of; but the scope and connection of the passage evidently confirm the former meaning. Indeed it is not true that our Lord did not come to call self-righteous persons to repentance: he certainly came as much to call them as any other class of sinners. Such were the scribes and Pharisees, and many of his discourses were evidently levelled at them, and intended to bring them to a sense of their sin and danger, in order to their humiliation, self-abasement, and conversion. See this paragraph more fully explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/9-9.htm" title="And as Jesus passed forth from there, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him, Follow me.

It was a wonder of his grace, that the call was made so effectual. It was a wonder of his grace, that he came to call sinners to repentance, and to assure them of pardon. It was a wonder of his grace, that he so patiently bore the contradiction of sinners against himself and his disciples. It was a wonder of his grace, that he fixed the services of his disciples according to their strength and standing. The Lord trains up his people gradually for the trials allotted them; we should copy his example in dealing with the weak in faith, or the tempted believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Made him a great feast - This circumstance "Matthew," or "Levi" as he is here called, has omitted in his own gospel. This fact shows how little inclined the evangelists are to say anything in favor of themselves or to praise themselves. True religion does not seek to commend itself, or to speak of what it does, even when it is done for the Son of God. It seeks retirement; it delights rather in the consciousness of doing well than in its being known; and it leaves its good deeds to be spoken of, if spoken of at all, by others. This is agreeable to the direction of Solomon <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>; "Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth." This feast was made expressly for our Lord, and was attended by many publicans, probably people of wicked character; and it is not improbable that Matthew got them together for the purpose of bringing them into contact with our Lord to do them good. Our Saviour did not refuse to go, and to go, too, at the risk of being accused of being a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>. But his motives were pure. In the thing itself there was no harm. It afforded an opportunity of doing good, and we have no reason to doubt that the opportunity was improved by the Lord Jesus. Happy would it be if all the "great feasts" that are made were made in honor of our Lord; happy if he would be a welcome guest there; and happy if ministers and pious people who attend them demeaned themselves as the Lord Jesus did, and they were always made the means of advancing his kingdom. But, alas! there are few places where our Lord would be "so unwelcome" as at great feasts, and few places that serve so much to render the mind gross, dissipated, and irreligious. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. their scribes&#8212;a mode of expression showing that Luke was writing for Gentiles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 30. <span class="bld">See Poole on "Lu 5:27"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But their Scribes and Pharisees,....

The other evangelists represent these as saying, why does he, or your master, eat with such? doubtless, they included both Christ, and his disciples; though they chiefly designed him, and to bring an accusation against him, and fix a charge upon him, in order to render him odious to the people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-30.htm" title="But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?">Luke 5:30</a>. <span class="greekheb">οἱ φαρισαῖοι καὶ οἱ γραμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>, the Pharisees, and the scribes connected with them, the professional men of the party.

The tyranny of pseudo-orthodoxy which they had established, and the insolent terrorism with which it was enforced, were denounced by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-37.htm" title="And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee sought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat....">Luke 11:37-54</a>) in terms of which the burning force can best be understood by seeing from the Talmud how crushing were the ‘secular chains’ in which they had striven to bind the free conscience of the people—chains which it became His compassion to burst (see Gfrörer, <span class="ital">Jahrh. d.

The older authorities vary slightly in the position of the words here. The best reading and translation would give, "The Pharisees and the scribes among them" - "among them," that is, among the Capernaites; in other words, "They among them who were Pharisees and scribes." These scribes (Hebrew, <span class="accented">sopherim</span>), under this appellation, first appear after the Exile. Their occupation was to copy and to expound the Law. They were the recognized teachers of the Jews, and seem to have succeeded that great and influential class or order, the "sons of the prophets," originally founded by Samuel. These "sons of the prophets" are repeatedly mentioned in the books of the Old Testament which treat of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The scribes were succeeded, in the year , by the <span class="accented">tanaim</span> (repeaters), under which name the scribes were officially, though apparently not popularly, known until A.D. , after which date these scribes were termed <span class="accented">amoraim.</span> The Talmud (Mishna and Gemara) may be said to have been the work of this great and enduring teacher order. The Talmud was finally closed in A.D. , by Rabbina Abina, the last of the amoraim. <span class="cmt_word">Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?.</span> </body></html>
