The disciples' prejudices were so strong, that they would not understand these things literally. They were so intent upon the prophecies which spake of Christ's glory, that they overlooked those which spake of his sufferings. People run into mistakes, because they read their Bibles by halves, and are only for the smooth things. We are as backward to learn the proper lessons from the sufferings, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, as the disciples were to what he told them as to those events; and for the same reason; self-love, and a desire of worldly objects, close our understandings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-17.htm">Matthew 20:17-19</a>.<p>By the prophets - Those who foretold the coming of the Messiah, and whose predictions are recorded in the Old Testament.<p>Son of man - The Messiah.

Hitherto, except for scattered hints which they could not understand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-22.htm" title="Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the third day.">Luke 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-45.htm" title="But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.">Luke 9:45</a>), the Apostles might have supposed that Jesus would be put to death by the Jewish authorities. Now He tells them that He shall be delivered <span class="bld"><span class="ital">to the Gentiles</span></span>, which involved the fact that He should be crucified, as indeed now for the first time He plainly told them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm" title="And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to whip, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.">Matthew 20:19</a>). It was necessary thus to check all blind material Messianic hopes, the ineradicable prevalence of which was proved immediately afterwards by the ambitious request of Salome and her sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/10-35.htm" title="And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Master, we would that you should do for us whatever we shall desire....">Mark 10:35-45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/20-20.htm" title="Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him....">Matthew 20:20-28</a>). But while the magnificent promises which they had just heard, and the magnificent miracle which they would immediately witness, together with the shouting multitudes who would soon be attending our Lord, made it necessary thus to extinguish all <span class="bld"><span class="ital">worldly</span></span> hopes in their minds, yet to prevent them from being crushed with sorrow, He now adds, without any ambiguity, the prophecy of His resurrection on the third day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/18.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-32.htm" title="For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:">Luke 18:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐμπαιχθήσεται</span>, <span class="ital">He shall be mocked</span>) in jeering sport (being made game of).—<span class="greekheb">ὑβρισθήσεται</span>, <span class="ital">He shall he loaded with insults</span>) in deliberate earnest.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32, 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: and they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again</span>. The outlines of the Passion he had sketched for the disciples before on two occasions, But never so clearly as now. He even tells them the manner of his end, and how his own countrymen would give him up to the Romans, and how these Gentiles, amidst every conceivable circumstance of horror, would do him to death. And the Master closed his dread revelation by predicting his speedy resurrection. </body></html>
