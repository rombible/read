He was not only blind, but poor, the fitter emblem of the world of mankind which Christ came to heal and save. The prayer of faith, guided by Christ's encouraging promises, and grounded on them, shall not be in vain. The grace of Christ ought to be thankfully acknowledged, to the glory of God. It is for the glory of God if we follow Jesus, as those will do whose eyes are opened. We must praise God for his mercies to others, as well as for mercies to ourselves. Would we rightly understand these things, we must come to Christ, like the blind man, earnestly beseeching him to open our eyes, and to show us clearly the excellence of his precepts, and the value of his salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-29.htm">Matthew 20:29-34</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 18:35-43. Blind Man Healed.<p>In Mt 20:29-34, they are two, as in the case of the Demoniac of Gadara. In Matthew and Mark (Mr 10:46-52) the occurrence is connected with Christ's departure from Jericho; in Luke with His approach to it. Many ways of accounting for these slight divergences of detail have been proposed. Perhaps, if we knew all the facts, we should see no difficulty; but that we have been left so far in the dark shows that the thing is of no moment any way. One thing is plain, there could have been no collusion among the authors of these Gospels, else they would have taken care to remove these "spots on the sun."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 36-43. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-30.htm" title="And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, you son of David.">Matthew 20:30</a>"</span>, and following verses to <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-34.htm" title="So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.">Matthew 20:34</a></span>, <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-46.htm" title="And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.">Mark 10:46</a>"</span>, and following verses to <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-52.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you whole.

It speaks the blind man’s persuasion, that Christ was the Messiah; for it was an uncontrolled tradition amongst the Jews, that the Messiah was to be the Son of David. Christ rewards the least exercises of true faith, but much more the higher exercises of it. It doth not appear that this blind man was fully informed who the Messiah should be, viz.
