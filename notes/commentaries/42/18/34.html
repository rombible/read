It is as though his professional habit of analysis led him to dwell on these psychological phenomena as explaining the subsequent bewilderment of the disciples, and their slowness to believe that their Lord had risen from the dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-11.htm" title="And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.">Luke 24:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm" title="But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.">Luke 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm" title="Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:">Luke 24:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-38.htm" title="And he said to them, Why are you troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?">Luke 24:38</a>). They heard the words, but, as we say, did not “take in” their meaning.

Its precise meaning is “covered” or “veiled,” rather than hidden. Some such thought of dimmed perception was in St. Paul’s mind when he said of the unbelieving Jews that, as they heard the Law and the Prophets, “the veil was upon their hearts” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart.">2Corinthians 3:15</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:31-34 The Spirit of Christ, in the Old Testament prophets, testified beforehand his sufferings, and the glory that should follow, 1Pe 1:11. The disciples' prejudices were so strong, that they would not understand these things literally. They were so intent upon the prophecies which spake of Christ's glory, that they overlooked those which spake of his sufferings. People run into mistakes, because they read their Bibles by halves, and are only for the smooth things. We are as backward to learn the proper lessons from the sufferings, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, as the disciples were to what he told them as to those events; and for the same reason; self-love, and a desire of worldly objects, close our understandings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Understood none of these things - Though they were "plainly" revealed, yet such were their prejudices and their unwillingness to believe them that they did not understand them. They expected that he would be a temporal prince and a conqueror, and they were not "willing" to believe that he would be delivered into the hands of his enemies. They did not see how that could be consistent with the prophecies. To us now these things appear plain, and we may, hence, learn that those things which to us appear most mysterious may yet appear perfectly plain; and we should learn to trust in God, and "believe" just what he has spoken.

"Not one of them", as the Syriac and Persic versions render it; every article of his sufferings and death were unintelligible by them; they knew not how to understand him in any one point: or how to reconcile these things to the notions they had entertained of the temporal grandeur, and glory, of the Messiah, and his kingdom; and which shows their great ignorance of the prophecies of the Old Testament concerning these things. <p>And this saying, or "thing"; for it answers to the Hebrew word  which signifies any affair, or matter, as well as a word, or saying: and so here, the whole of this affair <p>was hid from them; unless it should have a peculiar regard to that part of it, which expresses his resurrection from the dead; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-10.htm">Mark 9:10</a> or the delivery of him to the Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-44.htm">Luke 9:44</a><p>neither knew they the things which were spoken; the meaning of them.

This is peculiar to Lk. A similar statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-45.htm" title="But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.">Luke 9:45</a> with the same curious repetition. “An emphatic prolixity” is Meyer’s comment. J. Weiss (Meyer) from the facts that this verse repeats <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-45.htm" title="But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.">Luke 9:45</a> and that Lk. avoids repetition infers that the words must have been in his source. I rather think that we have here an effort on Lk.’s part to compensate by a general statement about the ignorance of the Twelve for the instructive narrative about the two sons of Zebedee which comes in at this point in Mt. and Mk., and which Lk. omits, doubtless by way of sparing the disciples an exposure. The iteration (same thing said three times) is in Lk.’s manner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-8.htm" title="And there sat a certain man at Lystra, weak in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked:">Acts 14:8</a>), but it is significant here. The aim is by repetition of a general statement to convey the impression made by the concrete story—an utter impossibility. No wonder Lk. labours in expression, in view of that humiliating proof of ignorance and moral weakness! But the attempt to express the inexpressible is interesting as showing that Lk. must have had the sons of Zebedee incident in his mind though he does not choose to record it. The omission of this incident carries along with it the omission of the second and most important saying of our Lord concerning the significance of His death. Lk.’s gospel contains hardly any basis for a doctrine on that subject (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34</span>.<span class="bld"> <span class="ital">they understood none of these things</span></span>] as had been the case before, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/9-43.htm" title="And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God.

But they listened all dazed and confused; they could not take it in, neither the shame of the death of their loved Leader, nor the glory of the Resurrection which was to follow immediately after. They could not persuade themselves that the hopes of an earthly Messianic glory in which they were to; share must positively Be given up. "We must learn to love Divine truths Before we can understand them," said Pascal.
