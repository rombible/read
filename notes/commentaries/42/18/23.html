Many who are loth to leave Christ, yet do leave him. After a long struggle between their convictions and their corruptions, their corruptions carry the day. They are very sorry that they cannot serve both; but if one must be quitted, it shall be their God, not their wordly gain. Their boasted obedience will be found mere outside show; the love of the world in some form or other lies at the root. Men are apt to speak too much of what they have left and lost, of what they have done and suffered for Christ, as Peter did. But we should rather be ashamed that there has been any regret or difficulty in doing it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-13.htm">Matthew 19:13-30</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23-25. was very sorrowful&#8212;Matthew (Mt 19:22) more fully, "went away sorrowful"; Mark still more, "was sad" or "sullen" at that saying, and "went away grieved." Sorry he was, very sorry, to part with Christ; but to part with his riches would have cost him a pang more. When Riches or Heaven, on Christ's terms, were the alternative, the result showed to which side the balance inclined. Thus was he shown to lack the one all-comprehensive requirement of the law&#8212;the absolute subjection of the heart to God, and this want vitiated all his other obediences.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-18.htm" title="And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 18:18</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when he heard this,....

Lk.’s expression differs from that of Mt. and Mk. ((<span class="greekheb">ἦν ἔχων κτήματα πολλά</span>). Lk. follows Mk. in the most important points—the words first spoken by the ruler to Jesus: <span class="ital">good</span> Master, etc., and the reply of Jesus to him: why callest thou me good? but he agrees with Mt. in omitting some vivid traits found in Mk.: the placing of the incident (“going forth into the way”), the action of the man as he approached Jesus (<span class="greekheb">προσδραμὼν</span>, <span class="greekheb">γονυπετήσας</span>), the title <span class="greekheb">διδάσκαλε</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-20.htm" title="And he answered and said to him, Master, all these have I observed from my youth.">Mark 10:20</a>), and, most remarkable feature of all, the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-21.htm" title="Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go your way, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and follow me.">Mark 10:21</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐμβλέψας αὐτῷ ἠγάπησεν αὐτόν</span>, which so clearly excludes the notion entertained by many that the man was a self-complacent Pharisee.

Nothing, however, forbids us to hope that the words of Jesus who ‘loved him’ sank into his soul, and brought him to a humbler and holier frame of mind. But meanwhile he lost for his earthly dross that eternal blessedness of self-sacrifice which Christ had offered him. The day came when Saul of Tarsus was like this youth ‘touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless;’ but <span class="ital">he</span> had grace to count all things but loss for Christ. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-6.htm" title="Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless....">Php 3:6-9</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/18.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div>[23. <span class="greekheb">Περίλυπος ἐγένετο</span>, <span class="ital">he was much saddened</span> [very sorrowful]) The rich Zaccheus obtained what was much better in his joy (<span class="ital">i.e.</span> by his joyfully receiving Christ, than the rich ruler did by going away from Him in sorrow), ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-6.htm" title="And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.">Luke 19:6</a>.—V. g.]<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he heard this, he was</span> <span class="cmt_word">very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</span> St. Mark adds (a memory of Peter's) that when he heard this the ruler went away frowning, with a lowering look. <span class="accented">This</span> was too much. He could not, even at the bidding of that loved Teacher, give up the pleasant life he loved so well, the things he prized so highly; so silently and sadly he turned away. The 'Gospel of the Hebrews,' a very ancient document, dating from the first days of the faith, a few fragments only of which have come down to us in quotations in the Fathers, thus describes the scene: "Then the rich man began to scratch his head, for that was not to his mind. And the Lord said to him, How then canst thou say, I have kept the Law; for it is written in the Law, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; and, lo! many of thy brethren, children of Abraham, live in the gutter, and die of hunger, while thy table is loaded with good things, and nothing is sent out to them?" (quoted by Origen, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19.htm">Matthew 19</a>.). Dante calls this "The Great Refusal," and represents the shade of the young ruler among the throng of the useless, of those who faced both ways (' Inferno,' 10:27). It is worthy of notice that there was no angry retort from the wealthy ruler, no scornful, cynical smile of derision, as we read of among the covetous, wealthy Pharisees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-14.htm">Luke 16:14</a>). Still, in the heart of this seeker after the true wisdom there was a sore conflict. Grieving, sorrow-stricken, with gloomy looks, he turned away in silence. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He was very sorrowful<p>Rev., more correctly renders &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, he became.
