Many who are loth to leave Christ, yet do leave him. After a long struggle between their convictions and their corruptions, their corruptions carry the day. They are very sorry that they cannot serve both; but if one must be quitted, it shall be their God, not their wordly gain. Their boasted obedience will be found mere outside show; the love of the world in some form or other lies at the root. Men are apt to speak too much of what they have left and lost, of what they have done and suffered for Christ, as Peter did. But we should rather be ashamed that there has been any regret or difficulty in doing it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-13.htm">Matthew 19:13-30</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. when Jesus saw&#8212;Mark says (Mr 3:34), He "looked round about"&#8212;as if first following the departing youth with His eye&#8212;"and saith unto His disciples."<p>How hardly, &c.&#8212;with what difficulty.
