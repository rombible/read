That which the others use was unknown to Attic writers. The fact, small as it is, takes its place among the signs of St. Luke’s culture.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:18-30 Many have a great deal in them very commendable, yet perish for lack of some one thing; so this ruler could not bear Christ's terms, which would part between him and his estate. Many who are loth to leave Christ, yet do leave him. After a long struggle between their convictions and their corruptions, their corruptions carry the day. They are very sorry that they cannot serve both; but if one must be quitted, it shall be their God, not their wordly gain. Their boasted obedience will be found mere outside show; the love of the world in some form or other lies at the root. Men are apt to speak too much of what they have left and lost, of what they have done and suffered for Christ, as Peter did. But we should rather be ashamed that there has been any regret or difficulty in doing it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-13.htm">Matthew 19:13-30</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. easier for a camel, &c.&#8212;a proverbial expression denoting literally a thing impossible, but figuratively, very difficult.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-18.htm" title="And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 18:18</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For it is easier for a camel,....

(iii) The Rabbinic parallels are decisive to prove that <span class="ital">a camel</span> is meant because the Babylonian Jews using the same proverb substitute ‘an elephant’ for ‘a camel.’ (iv) It is the <span class="ital">object</span> of the proverb to express <span class="ital">human i?npossibility.</span> In the <span class="ital">human </span>sphere—apart from the special grace of God—it would be certain that those who <span class="ital">have</span> riches would be led to <span class="ital">trust</span> in them, and so would fail to enter into the kingdom of God, which requires absolute humility, ungrudging liberality, and constant self-denial.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom</span> <span class="cmt_word">of God.</span> This simile, taken in its plain and obvious sense, appears to many an exaggerated one, and various explanations have been suggested to soften it down. The best is found in Lord Nugent's 'Lands Classical and Sacred,' who mentions that in some modern Syrian towns the narrow gate for foot-passengers at the side of the larger gate by which waggons, camels, and other beasts of burden enter the city, is known as the "needle's eye." It is, however, very uncertain whether this term for the little gate was known in ancient times. But the simile was evidently a common one among the Jews. The Talmud, for instance, gives us the parallel phrase of an elephant passing through a needle's eye. The Koran repeats the very words of the Gospel. it is the object of the proverb to express human impossibility. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I would ride the camel,<br />Yea leap him flying, through the needle's eye<br />As easily as such a pampered soul<br />Could pass the narrow gate."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Southey.</span>) It seems strange that the three evangelists, SS. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, who tell this story of the young questioner and the Master's conversation with him, do not mention his name. And yet he must have been a conspicuous personage in the society of the time. First of all, his riches were evidently remarkable. One account tells us that he was" very rich." Two of the Gospels mention his "great possessions." St. Luke tells us that he was "a ruler." He was, then, certainly a very wealthy Jew holding a high official position, not improbably a member of the Sanhedrin council. Why is he nameless in the three Gospels? Dean Plumptre has a most interesting theory that the young wealthy ruler was <span class="accented">Lazarus of Bethany.</span> He bases his hypothesis upon the following data: He begins by stating that "there is one other case in the first two Gospels which presents similar phenomena. ]n the narrative of the supper at Bethany, St. Matthew and St. Mark record the passionate affection which expressed itself in pouring the precious ointment of spikenard upon our Lord's head as the act of 'a woman' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-7.htm">Matthew 26:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3</a>), leaving her unnamed. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a> we find that the woman was Mary, the sister of Lazarus. The train of thought thus suggested points to the supposition that here also there may have been reasons for suppressing in the records a name which was familiar to the narrator. What if the young ruler were Lazarus himself? The points of agreement are sufficiently numerous to warrant the conjecture. The household of Lazarus, as the spikenard ointment shows, were of the wealthier class. The friends who came to comfort the bereaved sisters were themselves, in St. John's language, 'of the Jews,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the chief rulers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-19.htm">John 11:19</a>). The young ruler was obviously a Pharisee, and the language of Martha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-24.htm">John 11:24</a>) shows that she, too, believed in eternal life and the resurrection of the dead. The answer to the young ruler, ' One thing thou lackest' (as given by St. Mark and St. Luke), is almost identical with that to Martha, 'One thing is needful' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-42.htm">Luke 10:42</a>). In such a case, of course, nothing can be attained beyond conjectural inference; but the present writer must avow his belief that the coincidences in this case are such as to carry the evidence to a very high point of probability." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Camel<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-24.htm">Matthew 19:24</a>.<p>To go through the eye of a needle (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., more literally, to enter in through a needle's eye.

Luke alone has &#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, which, besides being an older term, is the peculiar word for the surgical needle. The other word is condemned by the Greek grammarians as barbarous. </body></html>
