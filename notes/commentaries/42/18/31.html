People run into mistakes, because they read their Bibles by halves, and are only for the smooth things. We are as backward to learn the proper lessons from the sufferings, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, as the disciples were to what he told them as to those events; and for the same reason; self-love, and a desire of worldly objects, close our understandings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-17.htm">Matthew 20:17-19</a>.<p>By the prophets - Those who foretold the coming of the Messiah, and whose predictions are recorded in the Old Testament.<p>Son of man - The Messiah.

We have great need to consider well what notions we entertain concerning the things of God. All this blindness and unbelief of the disciples was bottomed in the false notion of the Messiah which they had taken up. However, our Saviour thought fit to inculcate them, to prepare them against the offence they might take at them when the providence of God brought them forth.

This signal miracle was omitted by the Synoptists for the same reasons as those which led them to a marked reticence about the family of Lazarus (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-38.htm" title="Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.">Luke 10:38</a> and my <span class="ital">Life of Christ, </span>ii. 173). This miracle led to a meeting of the Sanhedrin, at which it was decided—mainly on the authority of Caiaphas—that Jesus must be put to death though not during the ensuing Passover,—with such precautions as were possible. The terrible decision became known. Indeed, it led to attempts to murder Lazarus and seize Jesus, which compelled Him to retire secretly to the obscure village of Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm" title="Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went there to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.">John 11:54</a>)— probably Et-Taiyibeh, not far from Bethel (Beitin), and about 20 miles from Jerusalem. Here our Lord spent, in undisturbed and unrecorded calm, the last few weeks of His life, occupied in training the Apostles who were to convert the world. Towards the close of the time He would see, from the hill of Ephraim, the crowds of Galilaean pilgrims streaming down the Jordan valley to keep the Passover at Jerusalem.; and, secure under their protection till His brief days of destined work were done, He left His place of retreat to join their caravans for His last solemn progress to Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/18.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-31.htm" title="Then he took to him the twelve, and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.">Luke 18:31</a>. <span class="greekheb">Παραλαβὼν</span>, <span class="ital">having taken to Him</span>) in private: <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-17.htm" title="And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said to them,">Matthew 20:17</a>.—<span class="greekheb">πάντα τὰ γεγραμμένα</span>, <span class="ital">all things that are written</span>) Jesus made of the utmost consequence those things which had been written.

There was something unusual, evidently, in the manner and behaviour of the Master; silently, wrapped up in his own lofty meditations, he strode on in front of the company of his followers. A feeling of awe and fear stole over them as they watched the silent Master with the shadow of the coming cross falling, perhaps, across his countenance. Much had happened lately: the teaching growing more and more solemn as the end drew near; the raising of Lazarus; the intense enmity of the great men of the nation; the fixed determination to put the Master to death; his short retirement; then the announcement  that he was going up to face his enemies at the great feast in Jerusalem; and now alone and silent he walked at their head. What was coming? thought the twelve and their friends.
