We have again to choose between the two alternative views, (1) that the words were spoken but once, and floated in men’s memories without any very definite note of time or place, and were wrongly placed by one, or, possibly, by both Evangelists; or (2) that they were repeated on different occasions.

For, notwithstanding he had often resided in those cities, and performed many miracles before the inhabitants of them, they had continued impenitent. Wherefore, because he was never to preach to them any more, and because he knew how great their punishment would be, in the overflowing tenderness of his soul he affectionately lamented their obstinacy, which he foresaw would draw down on them the heaviest judgments. The same declaration Christ had made some time before. By repeating it now he warns the seventy not to lose time by going to those cities. At the same time, this part of his discourse was well calculated to comfort these disciples, now sent out, under the ill usage they might meet with; the preaching of Christ himself had often been unacceptable and unsuccessful, with respect to many of his hearers, and therefore it was not much to be wondered at if theirs should prove so likewise.” Considering the affectionate temper of our Lord, it is no wonder that he should renew his lamentation over those unhappy places where he had so intimately conversed; and that he should do it in such words as these, so well calculated to alarm and impress all that should hear or read them. O! that they might now have their due weight with those who might pass them over too slightly, when they occurred before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/11-20.htm" title="Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done, because they repented not:...">Matthew 11:20-24</a>.

Luke has not here any mistaken reminiscence (de Wette), but the disaster of these Galilaean cities lay sufficiently close to the heart of Jesus to force from Him the denunciation of woe <span class="ital">more than once</span>, and here, indeed, in very appropriate connection, since this woe brings into the light and confirms what has just been said at <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-12.htm" title="But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.">Luke 10:12</a> by the example of the cities which had rejected Jesus Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καθήμενοι</span> (see the critical remarks): the inhabitants, namely.

In Mt. the connection is very general. The woes simply find a place in a collection of moral criticisms by Jesus on His time: on John, on the Pharisees, and on the Galilean towns. Here they form part of Christ’s address to the Seventy, when sending them forth on their mission. Whether they properly come in here has been disputed. Wendt (L. J., p. 89) thinks they do, inasmuch as they indicate that the punishment for rejecting the disciples will be the same as that of the cities which were unreceptive to the ministry of the Master. J. Weiss (in Meyer), on the other hand, thinks the woes have been inserted here from a purely external point of view, noting in proof the close connection between <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-12.htm" title="But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.">Luke 10:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-16.htm" title="He that hears you hears me; and he that despises you despises me; and he that despises me despises him that sent me.">Luke 10:16</a>. It is impossible to be quite sure when the words were spoken, but also impossible to doubt that they <span class="ital">were</span> spoken by Jesus, probably towards or after the close of His Galilean ministry.—<span class="greekheb">καθήμενοι</span>, after <span class="greekheb">σποδῷ</span>, is an addition of Lk.’s, explanatory or pictorial.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>.

Now, we have no record of any miracles having been worked at Chorazin, the first mentioned. But these cities were in the immediate  vicinity of Capernaum, where for a length-cued period our Lord principally resided. He was, no doubt, during the Galilaean ministry, constantly in one or other of those bright, busy cities built on the shores of the Lake of Gennesaret. This bears out St. John's statement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-30.htm">John 20:30</a>) concerning the many unrecorded miracles of Christ, and gives us some notion of the numerous events in the life left without mention; much must have happened in Choraziu to have called forth this stern saying. Late research thinks it probable that the site of Chorazin has been discovered near Capernaum; the ruins, however, at a little distance, look but a mere rough heap of stones. A great theological truth is urged in this saying of the Master. Men will be judged not only for what they have done or failed to do, but their opportunities, their circumstances, their chances in life, will be, before they are judged, strictly taken into account. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Mighty works<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20</a>.<p>Sackcloth (&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>From the Hebrew sak: what is knotted together; net-shaped; coarsely woven. It was made of goats' or camels' hair (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>), and was a material similar to that upon which Paul wrought in tent-making. The same word in Hebrew is used to describe a grain-sack, and this coarse material of which it is made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-25.htm">Genesis 42:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-4.htm">Joshua 9:4</a>). So the Greek &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769; means a pack or baggage. The same root, according to some etymologists, appears in &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, a drag-net (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-47.htm">Matthew 13:47</a>), and &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Latin sagum, a coarse, soldier's cloak. It was employed for the rough garments for mourners (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-1.htm">Esther 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>), in which latter passage the sackcloth is put next the flesh in token of extreme sorrow. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-30.htm">2 Kings 6:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>.<p>Ashes (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834;)<p>As a sign of mourning. Defiling one's self with dead things, as ashes or dirt, as a sign of sorrow, was common among the Orientals and Greeks. Thus Homer describes Achilles on hearing of the death of Patroclus:<p>"Grasping in both hands<p>The ashes of the hearth, he showered them o'er<p>His head, and soiled with them his noble face."<p>Iliad, xviii., 28.<p>And Priam, mourning for Hector:<p>"In the midst the aged man<p>Sat with a cloak wrapped round him, and much dust<p>Strewn on his head and neck, which, when he rolled<p>continued...</body></html>
