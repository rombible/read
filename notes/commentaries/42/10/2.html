The verses that follow contain, as might have been expected from the analogous circumstances, much in common with those spoken on the mission of the Twelve. We have here, as in the sermons on the Mount and on the Plain, an example of our Lord’s repeating the expression of the same thoughts in nearly the same language.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-16 Christ sent the seventy disciples, two and two, that they might strengthen and encourage one another. The ministry of the gospel calls men to receive Christ as a Prince and a Saviour; and he will surely come in the power of his Spirit to all places whither he sends his faithful servants. But the doom of those who receive the grace of God in vain, will be very fearful Those who despise the faithful ministers of Christ, who think meanly of them, and look scornfully upon them, will be reckoned as despisers of God and Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36-37</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The former view contradicts the words of the passage, the latter the context.

This and many of the sayings reported on this occasion had been said apparently before, when the twelve had been sent out on a similar mission. It seems almost certain that, on several occasions, the Lord repeated the same expressions containing great truths, with scarcely any variation in language. The harvest simile was evidently a favourite one of the Master. "The field is the world" he told them in the parable of the sower. It is reproduced by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14-19</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The harvest (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>From &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, summer (compare &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to become warm).
