They had not looked for such great and immediate results. They had thought that the power to cast out demons had been confined to our Lord’s immediate action or to that of the Twelve, and they found that they too possessed the power to rescue the spirits of men from thraldom. With them, as with others, the consciousness of a new power was attended with a new pleasure, in this case, with that of high spiritual exultation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/luke/10.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Luke<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">CHRIST’S MESSENGERS: THEIR EQUIPMENT AND WORK<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-1.htm" title="After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, where he himself would come.">Luke 10:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-11.htm" title="Even the very dust of your city, which sticks on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be you sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come near to you.">Luke 10:11</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-17.htm" title="And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name.">Luke 10:17</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.">Luke 10:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The mission of the Seventy is clearly distinguished from and contrasted with that of the Twelve by the word ‘others’ in verse 1, which points back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-1.htm" title="Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.">Luke 9:1</a>. The Twelve were prohibited from going beyond Jews; the Seventy were under no such restriction, and were probably sent to the half-Gentile districts on the east of Jordan. The number of twelve had reference to the number of the tribes; that of seventy may have referred to the number of the elders, but it has also been suggested that its reference is to the supposed number of the nations. The appointment of the Twelve was to a permanent office; that of the Seventy to a transitory mission. Much of the charge given to either is given to both, as is most natural, since they had the same message, and both were sent to prepare for Christ’s personal ministry. But though the Seventy were sent out but for a short time, permanent principles for the guidance, not only of Christian workers, but of all Christian lives, are embodied in the charge which they received.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We note, first, that all personal service should be preceded by intense realisation of the immense field, and of the inadequacy, of Christian effort, which vision will culminate in prayer for more toilers to be ‘sent forth.’ The word implies a certain measure of compulsion, for an overmastering impulse is always needed to overcome human reluctance and laziness. No man has ever done large service for God who has not felt that, like the prophet, he was laid hold of by the Spirit, and borne away, whether he would or no. ‘I must speak,’ is felt by every true messenger of God. The prayer was answered by the sending of the pray-ers, as it often is. Note how Jesus implies that He is Lord of the harvest, in that His sending them is the answer to the petition. Note, too, the authority which He claims to exercise supreme sovereignty over the lives of men. He has the right to fling them into deadly peril for no other purpose than to proclaim His name. Lambs, ringed round by wolves with white, gleaming teeth, have little chance of life. Jesus gives His servants full warning of dangers, and on the very warning builds an exhortation to quiet confidence; for, if the sentence ends with ‘lambs in the midst of wolves,’ it begins with ‘I send you forth,’ and that is enough, for He will defend them when He seeth the wolf coming. Not only so, but He will also provide for all their needs, so they want no baggage nor money, nor even a staff. A traveller without any of these would be in poor case, but they are not to carry such things, because they carry Jesus. He who sends them forth goes with them whom He sends. Now, this precept, in its literal form, was expressly abolished afterwards {<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-36.htm" title="Then said he to them, But now, he that has a purse, let him take it, and likewise his money: and he that has no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.">Luke 22:36</a>}, but the spirit of it is permanent. If Christ sends us, we may trust Him to take care of us as long as we are on His errands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Energetic pursuit of their work, unimpeded by distractions of social intercourse, is meant by the prohibition of saluting by the way. That does not mean churlish isolation, but any one who has ever seen two Easterns ‘saluting’ knows what a long-drawn-out affair it is. How far along the road one might have travelled while all that empty ceremony was being got through! The time for salutations is when the journey is over. They mean something then. The great effect of the presence of Christ’s servants should be to impart the peace which they themselves possess. We should put reality into conventional courtesies. All Christians are to be peacemakers in the deepest sense, and especially in regard to men’s relations with God. The whole scope of our work may be summed up as being to proclaim and bring peace with God, with ourselves, with all others, and with circumstances. The universality of our message is implied in the fact that the salutation is to be given in every house entered, and without any inquiry whether a ‘son of peace’ is there. The reflex blessedness of Christian effort is taught in the promise that the peace, vainly wished for those who would not receive it, is not wasted like spilt water, but comes back like a dove, to the hand of its sender. If we do no other person good, we bless ourselves by all work for others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The injunctions as to conduct in the house or city that receives the messengers carry two principles of wide application. First, they demand clear disinterestedness and superiority to vulgar appetites. Christ’s servants are not to be fastidious as to their board and lodging. They are not to make demands for more refined diet than their hosts are accustomed to have, and they are not to shift their quarters, though it were from a hovel to a palace. The suspicion that a Christian worker is fond of good living and sensuous delights robs his work of power. But the injunction teaches also that there is no generosity in those who hear the message giving, and no obligation laid on those who deliver it by their receiving, enough to live and work on. The less we obviously look for, the more shall we probably receive. A high-minded man need not scruple to take the ‘hire’; a high-minded giver will not suppose that he has hired the receiver to be his servant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The double substance of the work is next briefly stated. The order in which its two parts stands is remarkable, for the healing of the sick is put first, and the proclamation of the nearness of the kingdom second. Possibly the reason is that the power to heal was a new gift. Its very priority in mention may imply that it was but a means to an end, a part of the equipment for the true and proper work of preaching the coming of the kingdom and its King. At all events, let us learn that Jesus wills the continual combination of regard to the bodily wants and sicknesses, and regard to the spiritual needs of men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The solemn instructions as to what was to be done in the case of rejection breathe a spirit the reverse of sanguine. Jesus had no illusions as to the acceptance of the message, and He will send no man out to work hiding from him the difficulties and opposition probably to be encountered. Much wisdom lies in deciding when a field of labour or a method of work should be abandoned as hopeless-for the present and for the individual worker, at all events. To do it too soon is cowardice; to delay it too long is not admirable perseverance, but blindness to plain providences. To shake off the dust is equivalent to severing all connection. The messenger will not bring away the least thing belonging to the city. But whatever men’s unbelief, it does not affect the fact, but it does affect their relation to the fact. The gracious message was at first that ‘the kingdom of God is come nigh <span class="ital">unto you</span>,’ but the last shape of it leaves out ‘unto you’: for rejection of the word cuts off from beneficial share in the word, and the kingdom, when it comes, has no blessing for the unbelieving soul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The return of the Seventy soon followed their being sent forth. They came back with a childish, surprised joy, and almost seem to have thought that Jesus would be as much astonished and excited as they were with the proof of the power of His name. They had found that they could not only heal the sick, but cast out demons. Jesus’ answer is meant to quiet down their excitement by teaching them that He had known what they were doing whilst they were doing it. When did He behold Satan fall from heaven? The context seems to require that it should be at the time when the Seventy were casting out demons. The contest between the personal Source of evil and Jesus was fought out by the principals, not by their subordinates, and it is already victoriously decided in Christ’s sight. Therefore, as the sequel of His victory, He enlarges His gifts to His servants, couching the charter in the words of a psalm {<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm" title="He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.">Psalm 91:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-16.htm" title="With long life will I satisfy him, and show him my salvation.">Psalm 91:16</a>}. Nothing can harm the servant without the leave of the Master, and if any evil befall him in his work, the evil in the evil, the poison on the arrow-head, will be wiped off and taken away. But great as are the gifts to the faithful servant, they are less to be rejoiced in than his personal inclusion among the citizens of heaven. Gifts and powers are good, and may legitimately be rejoiced in; but to possess eternal life, and to belong to the mother-city of us all, the New Jerusalem, is better than all gifts and all powers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/10-17.htm" title="And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name....">Luke 10:17-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the seventy returned </span>— The seventy disciples, having gone through the several parts of the country appointed them, returned and told their Master with great joy what they had done, <span class="ital">saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name </span>— We have not only cured diseases, according to the power thou wast pleased to give us, but, though thy commission did not directly express so much, yet even the devils themselves have been compelled to obey us, when in <span class="ital">thy name </span>we commanded them to go out of the persons whom they had possessed. From the manner in which they speak of this latter exertion of their power, it would appear to have been what they did not expect when they set out. For though Jesus had given them power to heal diseases, he had said nothing of their casting out devils. <span class="ital">And he said, I beheld Satan as lightning</span> — “I myself saw Satan, the great prince of the demons, <span class="ital">falling like lightning from heaven, </span>on his first transgression, and well remember how immediate and dreadful his ruin was: and I foresee, in spirit, that renewed, swift, and irresistible victory, of which this present success of yours is an earnest, and which the preaching of the gospel shall shortly gain over all these rebel powers, that, even in their highest strength and glory, were so incapable of opposing the arm of God.” Thus Doddridge, who adds, “I think this answer to the seventy loses much of its beauty and propriety, unless we suppose Satan to have been the prince of the demons they spoke of, and also allow a reference to the first fall of that rebellious spirit.” To be exalted unto heaven, signifies to be raised unto great power and privileges, and particularly to sovereign dominion. <span class="ital">To fall from heaven, </span>therefore, may signify to lose one’s dominion and pre-eminency. The devils, by the idolatry of the Gentiles and wickedness of the Jews, had been exalted into heaven, and had ruled mankind in opposition to the dominion of God; by the preaching of the gospel their power was to be destroyed in every country. As Christ foreknew this, so he here foretels it. <span class="ital">Behold, I give unto you power, </span>&c. — To prove that he had thrown down Satan from his exaltation, and that his power should, in the end, be totally destroyed; and to increase their joy, and render them more fit for their work, he here enlarges their powers.

This and similar passages seem to be allusions to the enrolment of citizens’ names in registers, by which their right to the privileges of citizenship was acknowledged by the community.

But let us beware of spiritual pride, which has been the destruction of many. Our Lord rejoiced at the prospect of the salvation of many souls. It was fit that particular notice should be taken of that hour of joy; there were few such, for He was a man of sorrows: in that hour in which he saw Satan fall, and heard of the good success of his ministers, in that hour he rejoiced. He has ever resisted the proud, and given grace to the humble. The more simply dependent we are on the teaching, help, and blessing of the Son of God, the more we shall know both of the Father and of the Son; the more blessed we shall be in seeing the glory, and hearing the words of the Divine Saviour; and the more useful we shall be made in promoting his cause.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The devils are subject unto us - The devils obey us.

Whether this joy of the seventy was more carnal than it ought, they rather rejoicing in that new power which they had received from Christ, than in the demonstration of Christ’s Divine power, and the confirmation of the doctrine of the gospel by these miraculous operations, is hard to determine; for though Christ’s reply seemeth to have a check in it, yet it is so qualified by the term <span class="ital">rather</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.">Luke 10:20</a></span>, that we cannot from thence absolutely conclude any such thing from it. Here is a difference to be observed between Christ’s and his disciples’ casting out of devils. Christ did it in his own name, by his own word of command, power, and authority; the disciples did it in Christ’s name, and by a power and authority derived from him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the seventy returned again,....

Lange, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> II. 2, p. 1070 f. (comp. also Philippi, <span class="ital">Glaubenslehre</span>, III. p. 308), refers it to the <span class="ital">temptation in the desert</span>, and conceives that with the rebuke of Christ, Get thee hence from me! Satan was “cast forth from the heavenly circle of Christ and His people.” Gregory Nazianzen and other Fathers, Euthymius Zigabenus, Maldonatus, and others, refer it to the <span class="ital">time of Christ’s incarnation</span>, by which Satan was cast down, a result which Christ here describes as a “dux belli suas narrans victorias” (Maldonatus). Other Fathers, including Origen and Theophylact, Erasmus and others, refer it to the <span class="ital">fall of the devil by sin</span>, whereby he lost his place in heaven. Thus also Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. I. p. 443, who indeed would have “the fall from heaven” to signify only the loss of the fellowship of the supramundane life of God (p. 458). According to this, the imperfect must have its reference to a fact of which Christ was a witness when He was still the <span class="greekheb">λόγος ἄσαρκος</span>. But against the explanation of Satan’s fall by sin, it is decisive that with this overthrow of Satan his power on earth was not <span class="ital">broken</span>, but it then first <span class="ital">began</span>. The explanation is therefore quite opposed to the connection in which our passage stands, since Jesus is not at all desirous of warning against arrogance (the view of many Fathers), but must certainly be speaking of the <span class="ital">destruction</span> of the devil’s power, of the <span class="ital">overthrow</span> of the devilish strength. Hence also Hilgenfeld is quite mistaken, <span class="ital">Evang</span>. p. 184, in making it refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm" title="And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceives the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.">Revelation 12:9</a>, saying that Jesus saw how the devil “even now is working with special energy upon the earth,” that with the near approach of the passion of Jesus (not for the first time shortly before the last day) came therefore the point of time when the devil, who had been driven out of the field, should develope his power anew. Moreover, Hahn, <span class="ital">Theol. d. N. T.</span> I. p. 342, rightly referring <span class="greekheb">ἐθεώρουν</span> to the time of sending out the Seventy, finds the meaning to be: I beheld Satan <span class="ital">descend</span> from heaven with the rapidity of lightning to <span class="ital">hinder your work</span>; but fear ye not, behold I give you power, etc. In accordance with the context, <span class="greekheb">πεσόντα</span> must mean the <span class="ital">knocking</span> down of the devil, not his descent from heaven; but the connection which Hahn makes with ver. 19 is neither intimated (in any wise by <span class="greekheb">ἀλλ</span> ̓ <span class="greekheb">ἰδοὺ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), nor does it suit the correct reading <span class="greekheb">δέδωκα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[131] Against this view Hofmann objects that it is foreign to the connection (wherefore?), and that it gives to the mission an importance that does not belong to it. But was it then something of little importance to send forth seventy new combatants against Satan’s power? Could not the commander of this new warrior band behold, in the spirit, when He sent them forth, the devil’s overthrow?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[132] <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</span> is not to be taken with <span class="greekheb">ἀστραπήν</span>, as Schleiermacher would have it, who, moreover, takes pains in his <span class="ital">Vorles. üb. d. L. J.</span> p. 333 ff., with subtlety at variance with true exegesis, to exclude the doctrine of the devil from the teaching of Jesus. He says that Jesus speaks of the devil according to a current representation,—just as people speak of ghosts, without believing in their reality, and as we say that the sun rises, though everybody knows that the sun does not in reality rise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[133] Which, however, by a glance at <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-5.htm" title="He that overcomes, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-8.htm" title="The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.">Revelation 17:8</a>, is shown to be erroneous. Moreover, according to Weizsäcker, vv. 18–20 are said to be of the “latest origin.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/10-17.htm" title="And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name....">Luke 10:17-20</a>. <span class="ital">Return of the Seventy</span>.

How wavering and hesitating the faith of the chosen followers of Jesus was, even at this late period of his public ministry, is clear from this frank confession of surprise at their powers. They were contrasting the present with what had lately happened at the foot of the Mount of Transfiguration, where the disciples were utterly unable to heal the possessed boy. What a contrast do these true writers of the gospel story paint between themselves and their Master! They never seem to tire in their self-depreciatory descriptions. They describe with the same careful, truthful pen their slowness to understand what afterwards became so clear to them - their mutual jealousies, their covetous hopes of a brilliant future, their shrinking from pain and suffering, their utter failure when they try to imitate their Master; and now we find them marvelling at their own - to them - unexpected success in their imitation of him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The seventy<p>"The fuller development of the new dispensation begins with the mission of the seventy, and not with the mission of the apostles.
