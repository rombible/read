That was the great blessing for them, and for all believing souls after them. The words leave open the question whether that registration conferred a title which they could not forfeit, and the current language of the Old Testament—the prayer of Moses, “Blot me out of Thy book” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm" title="Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.">Exodus 32:32</a>), the warnings of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-33.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.">Exodus 32:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm" title="Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.">Deuteronomy 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-20.htm" title="The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie on him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.">Deuteronomy 29:20</a>—would suggest the thought that even here the joy was to be tempered with fear and trembling. The reappearance of a like promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-5.htm" title="He that overcomes, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.">Revelation 3:5</a> as the reward of obedience, and therefore conditioned by it, no less than the general tenor of the teaching of the Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm" title="But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.">1Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-21.htm" title="I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.">Galatians 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-10.htm" title="Why the rather, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:">2Peter 1:10</a>), confirms this interpretation. It may be noted (1) that the better MSS. omit the word “rather,” and introduce the second clause abruptly—“Rejoice that your names are written . . .;” and (2), as implied above, that the root-thought of the image is that of a king taking the census of those who are citizens of his kingdom, as distinguished from aliens and foreigners. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/87-4.htm" title="I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me: behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.">Psalm 87:4-5</a>, we have a memorable instance at once of the literal fact and of its spiritual application.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/luke/10.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Jeremiah<span class="bld"> - Luke<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>CHRIST’S MESSENGERS: THEIR EQUIPMENT AND WORK<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>TWO LISTS OF NAMES<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm" title="O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake you shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.">Jeremiah 17:13</a></span>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject to you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.">Luke 10:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A name written on earth implies that the bearer of the name belongs to earth, and it also secondarily suggests that the inscription lasts but for a little while. Contrariwise, a name written in heaven implies that its bearer belongs to heaven, and that the inscription will abide.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We find running throughout Scripture the metaphor of books in which men’s names are written. Moses thought of a book which God has written, and in which his name was enrolled. A psalmist speaks of the ‘book of the living,’ and Isaiah of those who are ‘written among the living in Jerusalem.’ Ezekiel threatens the prophets who speak lies in Jehovah’s name that they ‘shall not be written in the writing of the house of Israel.’ The Apocalypse has many references to the book which is designated as ‘the Lamb’s book of life,’ and which is opened at the final judgment along with the books in which each man’s life-history is written, and only ‘they who are written in the Lamb’s book of life’ enter into the city that comes down out of heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The principle on which the two lists are made up.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is commonly supposed that the idea of unconditional predestination is implied in the writing of the names in the book of life. There is nothing in the figure itself to lead to that, and the text from Jeremiah suggests, on the contrary, that the voluntary attitude of men to God determines their being or not being inscribed in the book of heaven, since it is ‘they who depart from God’ whose ‘names are written on earth.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then, since in the New Testament the book of life is called ‘the Lamb’s,’ we are led to think of Christ as writing in it, and hence of our faith in Him as being the condition of enrolling our names.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The significance of the lists.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>They are lists of the living and of the dead.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> True life is in fellowship with God. The other is the register of the burials in a graveyard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They are lists of the citizens of two cities.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The idea is that the one class have relations and affinities with the celestial, are ‘fellow-citizens with the saints,’ and have heaven as their metropolis, their mother city. Therefore they are but as aliens here, and should not wish to be naturalised. The other class are citizens of the earthly, belonging to the present, with all their thoughts and desires bounded by this visible diurnal sphere.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They are lists of those who shall be forgotten, and their works annihilated, and of those who shall be remembered and their work crowned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The names written on earth are swiftly obliterated, like a child’s scrawl on the sand which is washed away by the next tide, or covered up by the next storm that blows about the sand-hills. What a contrast is that of the names written on the heavens, high up above all earthly mutations!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In one sense oblivion soon seizes on us all. In another none of us is ever forgotten by God, but good and bad alike live in His thought. Still this idea of a special remembrance has place, as suggesting that, however unnoticed or forgotten on earth, God’s children live in the true ‘Golden Book.’ Their names are in the book of life. ‘Of so much fame, in heaven expect the meed.’ Ay, and as, too, suggesting how brief after all is the honour that comes from men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Also, there will be annihilation or perpetuation of their life’s work. Nothing lasts but the will of God. Men who live godless lives are engaged in true Sisyphean labour. They are running counter to the whole stream of things, and what can be left at the end but frustrated endeavours covered with a gloomy pall?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Is your life to be wasted?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They are lists of those who are accepted in judgment, and of those who are not.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-15.htm" title="And whoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.">Revelation 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm" title="And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defiles, neither whatever works abomination, or makes a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.">Revelation 21:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The books of men’s lives are to be opened, and also the book of life. What is written in the former can only bring condemnation. If our names are written in the latter, then He will ‘confess our names before His Father and the holy angels.’ And He will joyfully inscribe them there if we say to Him, like the man in <span class="ital">Pilgrim’s Progress</span>, ‘Set down my name.’ He will write them not only there, but on the palms of His hands and the tablets of His heart.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:17-24 All our victories over Satan, are obtained by power derived from Jesus Christ, and he must have all the praise. But let us beware of spiritual pride, which has been the destruction of many. Our Lord rejoiced at the prospect of the salvation of many souls. It was fit that particular notice should be taken of that hour of joy; there were few such, for He was a man of sorrows: in that hour in which he saw Satan fall, and heard of the good success of his ministers, in that hour he rejoiced. He has ever resisted the proud, and given grace to the humble. The more simply dependent we are on the teaching, help, and blessing of the Son of God, the more we shall know both of the Father and of the Son; the more blessed we shall be in seeing the glory, and hearing the words of the Divine Saviour; and the more useful we shall be made in promoting his cause.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather rejoice ... - Though it was an honor to work miracles, though it is an honor to be endowed with talents, and influence, and learning, yet it is a subject of "chief" joy that we are numbered among the people of God, and have a title to everlasting life.<p>Names are written in heaven - The names of citizens of a city or state were accustomed to be written in a book or register, from which they were blotted out when they became unworthy, or forfeited the favor of their country.

That their "names were written in heaven," means that they were "citizens" of heaven; that they were friends of God and "approved" by him, and would be permitted to dwell with him. This was of far more value than all "earthly" honor, power, or wealth, and "in" this people should rejoice more than in eminent endowments of influence, learning, talents, or possessions. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. rejoice not, &c.&#8212;that is, not so much. So far from forbidding it, He takes occasion from it to tell them what had been passing in His own mind. But as power over demons was after all intoxicating, He gives them a higher joy to balance it, the joy of having their names in Heaven's register (Php 4:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is a usual thing in holy writ, to have prohibitions delivered in general terms, which must be understood in a restrained sense.

For it was doubtless a just cause of joy and rejoicing to them that Christ had honoured them with such an extraordinary gift and power, but not of so much joy as to know that their names were written in the book of life; for as the good was infinitely greater, so a proportionable joy was requisite upon the assurance of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The expression <span class="ital">written in heaven, </span> is equivalent to the being written <span class="ital">in the book of life, </span> whereby is signified, either the certain designation of some to eternal life, or effectual calling.

It is easily answered, that our Saviour’s words were true according to the usual phrase of speaking, if the generality of them only were such. Nor need our Saviour be understood as asserting all their names were so written, but only asserting the greatest cause of joy to be, if men can by their calling find that their election is sure. From our Saviour’s words we may infer, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That there is a book of life, an election of grace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That there are names written in this book; it is an election of persons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That men may know that their names are written in that book, otherwise they could not rejoice; no man rejoiceth but in a good with which he hath some degree of union. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That this is a greater cause of joy, than for a man to know that he hath a power to cast out devils. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Men may be made use of to cast out devils in Christ’s name, who yet may go to the devil at last, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm" title="Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name? and in your name have cast out devils? and in your name done many wonderful works?">Matthew 7:22</a>,23</span>; so cannot those whose names are written in the book of life. But I cannot understand that our Saviour in these words asserts that all the names of the seventy were written in that book. The tendency of his discourse is rather to quicken them to give all diligence to make sure of this cause of joy and rejoicing. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Notwithstanding in this rejoice not,....
