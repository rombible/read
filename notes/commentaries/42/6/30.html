But if we are thoroughly grounded in the faith of Christ's love, this will make his commands easy to us. Every one that comes to him for washing in his blood, and knows the greatness of the mercy and the love there is in him, can say, in truth and sincerity, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

These precepts of our Saviour must be interpreted, not according to the strict sense of the words, as if every man were by them obliged, without regard to his own abilities, or the circumstances of the persons begging or asking of him, to give to every one that hath the confidence to ask of him; but as obliging us to liberality and charity according to our abilities, and the true needs and circumstances of our poor brethren, and in that order which God’s word hath directed us; first providing for our own families, then doing good to the household of faith, then also to others, as we are able, and see any of them true objects of our charity. Nor must the second part of the verse be interpreted, as if it were a restraint of Christians from pursuing of thieves or oppressors, but as a precept prohibiting us private revenge, or too great contending for little things, &c. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-42.htm" title="Give to him that asks you, and from him that would borrow of you turn not you away.">Matthew 5:42</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And give to every man that asketh,....

Lk. passes over Mt.’s instance of compulsory service (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-41.htm" title="And whoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two.">Matthew 5:41</a>), perhaps because it would require explanation, or was not a practical grievance for his readers, and goes on to the duty of generous giving, which is to be carried the length of cheerfully resigning what is taken from us by force.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="ital">Give to every man that asketh of thee</span>] Literally, “<span class="ital">be giving </span>implying a <span class="ital">habit</span>, not an instant act. Here again we have a broad, general principle of unselfishness and liberality safely left to the common sense of mankind, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/15-7.htm" title="If there be among you a poor man of one of your brothers within any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother:...">Deuteronomy 15:7-9</a>. The <span class="ital">spirit</span> of our Lord’s precept is now best fulfilled by <span class="ital">not</span> giving to every man that asks, because in the altered circumstances of the age such indiscriminate almsgiving would only be a check to industry, and a premium on imposture, degradation, and vice. By ‘giving,’ our Lord meant ‘conferring a boon;’ but mere careless giving now, so far from conferring a boon, perpetuates a curse and inflicts an injury. The <span class="ital">spirit</span> of the precept is large-handed but <span class="ital">thoughtful</span> charity. Love must sometimes violate the letter as the only possible way of observing the spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-26.htm" title="But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.">Matthew 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not my to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.">Matthew 20:23</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-30.htm" title="Give to every man that asks of you; and of him that takes away your goods ask them not again.">Luke 6:30</a>. [<span class="greekheb">Παντὶ δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">but to every one</span>) There is in this respect too much accumulation of exceptions by human ingenuity.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">αἴροντος</span>, <span class="ital">that taketh away</span>) without asking.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give</span> <span class="cmt_word">to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again</span>. Here, again, it is clear that faithfully to cling to the literal interpretation would be utterly to ignore the true spirit of the Lord's words here, where he sets forth his sublime ideal of a charity which ignores its own rights and knows no limits to its self-sacrifice. Augustine quaintly suggests that in the words themselves will be found the limitation required. "'Give to every man,' but not <span class="accented">everything</span>,' suggesting that in many cases a medicine for the hurt of the soul would better carry out the words of the Lord than the gift of material help for the needs of the body ('Serm.' 359.). But such ingenious exposition, after all, is needless. What the Lord inculcated here was that broad, unselfish generosity which acts as though it really believed those other beautiful words of Jesus, that "it is more blessed to give than to receive." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Every one<p>Peculiar to Luke.
