In St. Matthew (Matthew 10) the mission of the Twelve is followed by a full discourse on their Apostolic work and its perils. Here it is followed by a discourse which has so many points of resemblance with the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5, 6, 7, that many have supposed it to be identical. It is a partial explanation of the difficulty that St. Mark and St. Luke distinguish the choice of the Twelve from their mission, the latter meeting us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-1.htm" title="Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.">Luke 9:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-7.htm" title="And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;">Mark 6:7</a>, and that in a form which implies the previous existence of the Twelve as a distinct body; but we still have to face the fact that events which St. Mark and St. Luke place even before the choice, St. Matthew places after the mission.

In serving God, our great care should be not to lose time, but to make the end of one good duty the beginning of another. The twelve apostles are here named; never were men so privileged, yet one of them had a devil, and proved a traitor. Those who have not faithful preaching near them, had better travel far than be without it. It is indeed worth while to go a great way to hear the word of Christ, and to go out of the way of other business for it. They came to be cured by him, and he healed them. There is a fulness of grace in Christ, and healing virtue in him, ready to go out from him, that is enough for all, enough for each. Men regard the diseases of the body as greater evils than those of their souls; but the Scripture teaches us differently.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And stood in the plain - It is not affirmed, however, that he stood in the plain when he delivered the following discourse. There has been some doubt whether the following discourse is the same as that recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>; 6; 7, or whether the Saviour "repeated" the substance of that discourse, and that Luke recorded it as he repeated it. The reasons which have led many to suppose that they refer to the same are:<p>1. That the beginning and the close are alike.<p>2. That the "substance" of each is the same. And,<p>3. That "after" the discourse was delivered, both affirm that Jesus went to Capernaum and healed the servant of the centurion, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-5.htm">Matthew 8:5-13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-1.htm">Luke 7:1-10</a>.<p>On the other hand, "Matthew" says that the sermon was delivered on the "mountain" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1</a>; it is thought to be implied that "Luke" affirms that it was in the "plain." Matthew says that he "sat;" Luke, that he "stood." Yet there is no reason to suppose that there is a difference in the evangelists. Jesus spent the night on the mountain in prayer. In the morning he descended into the open plain and healed many. While there, as Luke says, he "stood" and received those who came to him, and healed their diseases. There is no impropriety in supposing that, being pressed by multitudes, he retired into the mountain again, or to an eminence in the plain, or to the side of the mountain, where the people might be more conveniently arranged and seated to hear him. There he "sat," as recorded by Matthew, and delivered the discourse; for it is to be observed that Luke does "not" say that he delivered the sermon "on the plain," but only that he "healed the sick there."<p>Tyre and Sidon - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. in the plain&#8212;by some rendered "on a level place," that is, a piece of high tableland, by which they understand the same thing, as "on the mountain," where our Lord delivered the sermon recorded by Matthew (Mt 5:1), of which they take this following discourse of Luke to be but an abridged form. But as the sense given in our version is the more accurate, so there are weighty reasons for considering the discourses different. This one contains little more than a fourth of the other; it has woes of its own, as well as the beatitudes common to both; but above all, that of Matthew was plainly delivered a good while before, while this was spoken after the choice of the twelve; and as we know that our Lord delivered some of His weightiest sayings more than once, there is no difficulty in supposing this to be one of His more extended repetitions; nor could anything be more worthy of it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 17-19.

The divergence from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-1.htm" title="And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came to him:">Matthew 5:1</a> must be admitted, and remains still, even if a <span class="ital">plateau</span> is supposed on which jutted out a crest previously ascended by Jesus (Ebrard; comp.

According to Baur, <span class="ital">Evang</span>. p. 457, this divergence from Matthew is due also to the tendency of Luke to <span class="ital">degrade</span> the Sermon on the Mount, which would surely be a very <span class="ital">petty</span> sort of levelling.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ὄχλος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">scil</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔστη</span>.

T. The descent takes place in order to the delivery of a discourse which, with the choice of the Apostles, constitutes the occasion with reference to which Jesus had spent the night in prayer. The audience consists of three classes separately named (1) the Twelve, (2) the company of disciples described as an <span class="greekheb">ὄχλος πολὺς</span>, (3) a multitude (<span class="greekheb">πλῆθος</span>) gathered from a wide area. This is the same multitude from which in Mk.’s narrative Jesus <span class="ital">escaped</span> to the hill, taking His disciples with Him, to get rest, and presumably to devote some leisure time to their instruction. Of this desire to escape from the crowd, so apparent in Mk., there is no trace in Lk. In indicating the sources of this great human stream Lk. omits Galilee as superfluous, mentions Judaea and Jerusalem, passing over ldumaea and Peraea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-8.htm" title="And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came to him.">Mark 3:8</a>), and winds up with Tyre and Sidon, defining the territory there whence people came by the expression <span class="greekheb">τῆς παραλίου</span> (<span class="greekheb">χώρας</span> understood), the sea-coast. The people come from all these places to hear Jesus (<span class="greekheb">ἀκοῦσαι αὐτοῦ</span>) in the first place, as if in expectation of a great discourse, and also to be healed. The eagerness to get healing even by touch, of which Mk. gives so graphic a picture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-10.htm" title="And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?">Luke 3:10</a>), is faintly indicated by <span class="greekheb">ἐζήτουν</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐζήτει</span>, T.

If it be thus rendered there is no discrepancy between St Matthew, who says that “He went up into the mountain, and when He sat down His disciples approached Him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-1.htm" title="And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came to him:">Matthew 5:1</a>). I believe that St Luke here meant to give such portions of the Sermon on the Mount as suited his design. Combining the two narratives with what we know of the scene we see that what occurred was as follows. The previous evening Jesus went to one of the peaks of Kurn Hattin (withdrawing Himself from His disciples, who doubtless bivouacked at no great distance), and spent the night in prayer. In the morning He called His disciples and chose Twelve Apostles. Then going with them to some level spot, either the flat space (called in Greek <span class="ital">plax</span>) between the two peaks of the hill, or some other spot near at hand, He preached His sermon primarily to His disciples who sat immediately around Him, but also to the multitudes. There is no need to assume two discourses—one esoteric and one exoteric, &c. At the same time there is of course no difficulty in supposing that our Lord may have uttered the same discourse, or parts of the same discourse, more than once, varying it as occasion required.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">out of all Judea</span>] St Matthew adds Galilee (which was to a great extent Greek), Decapolis, and Peraea; St Mark also mentions Idumaea.

Leaving the uppermost slopes of the hill - the modern <span class="accented">Kurm Hattin</span>, or "Horns of Hattin" - where he had spent the night alone in prayer - Jesus probably descended a little and rejoined the band of disciples. Out of these he called the twelve above mentioned; and titan, with the whole body of disciples - the twelve, no doubt, closest to his Person - he continued the descent for some way. On a level spot situate on the hillside, very likely a fiat space between the two peaks of Hattin, the Master and his followers came upon a crowd of inquirers, who had ascended thus far to meet him. These were composed, as we shall see, of various nationalities. Some came with their sick friends, seeking a cure; some were urged by curiosity; others by a real longing to hear more of the words of life from his Divine lips. It was to this crowd that, surrounded by the newly elected twelve, as well as by the larger company of disciples, that Jesus spoke the  famous discourse known as the sermon on the mount. <span class="cmt_word">A great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea-coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him</span>.
