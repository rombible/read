There is also a slight variation in the form of the closing questions—St. Luke’s “what <span class= "ital">thank</span> have ye” pointing to the expectation of gratitude in return for good offices, St. Matthew’s “what <span class= "ital">reward”</span> to a more concrete and solid payment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/6-32.htm" title="For if you love them which love you, what thank have you? for sinners also love those that love them....">Luke 6:32-36</a></span>. <span class="ital">If ye love them which love you, what thank have ye </span>— What great thanks are due to you on that account? For there are some sentiments of gratitude common even to the worst of men, which incline the most scandalous <span class="ital">sinners </span>to <span class="ital">love those that love them, </span>and to profess an affectionate regard for those by whom they have been treated with respect and kindness. Here, says Theophylact, “If you only love them that love you, you are only like the sinners and heathen; but if you love those who do evil to you, you are like to God; which therefore will you choose? to be like sinners or like God?” Here we see that our Lord has so little regard for one of the highest instances of <span class="ital">natural </span>virtue, namely, the returning love for love, that he does not account it even to deserve thanks. <span class="ital">For even sinners, </span>saith he, <span class="ital">do the same — </span>Men who do not regard God at all. Therefore he may do this who has not taken one step in Christianity. <span class="ital">And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive </span>— And that, perhaps, with considerable advantage to yourselves; <span class="ital">what thank have ye? </span>— What favour do you show in that? or, what extraordinary thanks are due to you on that account? <span class="ital">for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive, </span><span class="greekheb">τα ισα</span>, <span class="ital">equal favours, </span>in return. <span class="ital">But love ye your enemies </span>— Ye who profess to be my disciples. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-43.htm" title="You have heard that it has been said, You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy....">Matthew 5:43-45</a>. <span class="ital">Do good and lend, hoping for nothing again </span>— Do good to those from whom you have no expectation of receiving any favour in return; and lend, in cases of great distress, even when you have little reason to expect what is lent to be repaid. Because the Greek expression, <span class="greekheb">μηδεν απελπιζοντες</span>, has, in no Greek author, the sense here, and in most translations, given to it, namely, <span class="ital">hoping for nothing again; </span>many commentators have declared in favour of the signification affixed to it by the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions; <span class="ital">neminem desperare facientes, causing no man to despair: </span>the copies from which these translations were made reading <span class="greekheb">μηδεν</span>’, with an apostrophe, for <span class="greekheb">μηδενα</span>. But, as Dr. Whitby observes, “this is putting a double force upon the words; 1st, reading, without the authority of any MS., <span class="greekheb">μηδενα</span>, <span class="ital">no man, </span>for <span class="greekheb">μηδεν</span>, <span class="ital">nothing; </span>and, 2d, interpreting <span class="greekheb">απελπιζειν</span>, <span class="ital">to cause to</span> <span class="ital">despair; </span>of which sense they give no instance.” The context seems evidently to justify our translation of the clause; for the preceding words are, <span class="ital">If ye lend to them, </span><span class="greekheb">παρ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">ων ελπιζετε απολαβειν</span>, <span class="ital">from whom ye hope to receive again, </span>namely, what you lend, or a similar favour, <span class="ital">what thank have ye, for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again. </span>It then naturally follows, <span class="ital">But do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again </span>— That is, lend not you on so mean an account, but even when you do not hope to have that returned which you lend, or to receive at some future time a like favour from the person you lend to. And whereas we are told that the word <span class="greekheb">απελπιζω </span>bears no such sense, “I hope,” says the doctor, “the credit of Stephanus, who says the word is rightly rendered by the Vulgate, <span class="ital">nihil inde sperantes, hoping for nothing thence; </span>and of Casaubon, who says <span class="greekheb">απελπιζειν </span>is to <span class="ital">hope for something from a person or matter; </span>may be sufficient to support the credit of our translation; especially when we read, in the Life of Solon, that he made no law against parricides, <span class="greekheb">δια το απελπισαι</span>, because he did <span class="ital">not expect </span>that such a crime would be committed; and find this like composition of the word<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">απεχειν</span>, when it signifies <span class="greekheb">απο τινος εχειν</span>, to receive from any one; and in the word <span class="greekheb">απεσθιειν</span>, which is used for <span class="greekheb">απο τινος εσθιειν</span>, <span class="ital">to eat of any thing.” </span>It must be acknowledged, however, that the more common and classical meaning of the term is, <span class="ital">despero, to despair; </span>and accordingly Dr. Campbell, with many others, renders the clause, <span class="ital">not at all, </span>or <span class="ital">nowise despairing: </span>observing, among several other arguments in support of this translation, “That what commonly proves the greatest hinderance to our lending, particularly to needy persons, is the dread that we shall never be repaid. It is, I imagine, to prevent the influence of such an over-cautious mistrust, that our Lord here warns us not to shut our hearts against the request of a brother in difficulties. Lend cheerfully, as though he had said, without fearing the loss of what shall be thus bestowed. It often happens that, even contrary to appearances, the loan is thankfully returned by the borrower; but if it should not, remember (and let this silence all your doubts) that God charges himself with what you give from love to him, and love to your neighbour: he is the poor man’s surety.” It may not be improper to add, that several Latin MSS., agreeably to this interpretation, read <span class="ital">nihil desperantes, “nothing despairing.” </span>Our Lord enforces the exhortation by adding, <span class="ital">and your reward shall be great, </span>probably even in this world, in the temporal prosperity with which God, in the course of his providence, will bless you: <span class="ital">for to him that hath, </span>uses aright what he hath, <span class="ital">shall be given, </span>and <span class="ital">he shall have more abundance, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm" title="For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that he has.">Matthew 13:12</a>. But if you are not recompensed in this world you certainly shall be in the world to come: for God is not unfaithful to forget our work and labour of love, which we show to his name. <span class="ital">And ye shall be the children of the Highest </span>— His genuine children, resembling him, bearing the image of his goodness; <span class="ital">for he is kind unto the unthankful and the evil — </span>Causing the undeserved benefits of the sun and rain to descend upon them, and conferring on them of his free unmerited bounty other innumerable benefits daily. <span class="ital">Be ye therefore merciful </span>— Compassionate, kind, beneficent, to the unworthy; <span class="ital">as your Father also is merciful </span>— Continually setting you an example of gratuitous goodness; as all his works, whether of creation, providence, or grace, amply declare.

The strength of our Saviour’s argument lieth in this, That God expects that those who have received more grace and favour from God than others, and who make a higher profession than others, should do more in obedience to the positive commands of God, and the revelations of his will in his word, than they who live merely by the light of nature, and live up merely to the law of nature. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye?....

On the words, "sinners also love those that love them," Augustine's words are singularly terse and quaint: "Amas amantes te filios et parentes.
