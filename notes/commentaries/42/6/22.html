All believers that take the precepts of the gospel to themselves, and live by them, may take the promises of the gospel to themselves, and live upon them. Woes are denounced against prosperous sinners as miserable people, though the world envies them. Those are blessed indeed whom Christ blesses, but those must be dreadfully miserable who fall under his woe and curse!

Ration. p. 10 ff.), and, moreover, is not to be inferred from what follows, wherein is depicted the hostility which is associated with the excommunication.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐκβάλωσι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὄν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὡς πονηρ</span>.] <span class="greekheb">ἐκβάλλειν</span> is just the German wegwerfen, in the sense of contemptuous rejection, Plato, Pol. ii. p. 377 C, Crit. p. 46 B; Soph. O. C. 637, 642; Ael. H. A. xi. 10; Kypke, I. p. 236; but <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὄνομα</span> is not auctoritas (Kypke), nor a designation of the character or the faith (de Wette), nor the name of Christian (Ewald), which idea (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-42.htm" title="And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.">Matthew 10:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-41.htm" title="For whoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you belong to Christ, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.">Mark 9:41</a>) occurs in this place for the first time by means of the following <span class="greekheb">ἕνεκα τοῦ υἱοῦ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>.; but the actual personal name, which designates the individual in question. Hence: when they shall have rejected your name (e.g. John, Peter, etc.) as evil, i.e. as being of evil meaning, because it represents an evil man in your person,—on account of the Son of man,—ye know yourselves as His disciples.

In the corresponding passage in Mt. there is first an objective didactic statement about the persecuted. then an expansion in the second person. Here all is in the second person, and the terms employed are such as suited the experience of the early Christians, especially those belonging to the Jewish Church, suffering, at the hands of their unbelieving countrymen, wrong in the various forms indicated—hatred, separation, calumny, ejection.—<span class="greekheb">ἀφορίσωσιν</span> may point either to separation in daily life (Keil, Hahn) or to excommunication from the synagogue (so most commentaries) = the Talmudic <span class="greekheb">נִדָּה</span>. In the former case one naturally finds the culminating evil of excommunication in the last clause—<span class="greekheb">ἐκβάλωσιν τὸ ὄ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑ</span>. = erasing the name from the membership of the synagogue. In the latter case this clause will rather point to the vile calumnies afterwards heaped upon the excommunicated. “Absentium nomen, ut improborum hominum, differre rumoribus,” Grotius.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">hate you...separate you...reproach...cast out your name as evil</span>] We have here four steps of persecution increasing in virulence:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) General hatred, (2) Exclusion from the synagogue, a lesser excommunication, viz. the <span class="ital">Neziphah</span> or exclusion for 30 days, or <span class="ital">Niddoui </span>for 90 days (Gfrorer, <span class="ital">Jahrh. d. Heils</span>, 1. 183; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-34.htm" title="They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.">John 9:34</a>. Hence <span class="ital">aphorismos</span> means ‘<span class="ital">excommunication</span>’), (3) Violent slander, (4) The <span class="ital">Cherem</span>, <span class="ital">Shammata</span>, or greater excommunication,—permanent expulsion from the Synagogue and Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-2.htm" title="They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time comes, that whoever kills you will think that he does God service.">John 16:2</a>). The Jews pretended that our Lord was thus excommunicated to the blast of 400 ram’s horns by Joshua Ben Perachiah (Wagenseil, <span class="ital">Sota</span>, p. 1057), and was only crucified forty days after because no witness came forward in His favour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as evil</span>] ‘Malefic’ or ‘execrable superstition’ was the favourite description of Christianity among Pagans (Tac. <span class="ital">Ann.</span> xv. 44; Suet. <span class="ital">Nero</span>, 16), and Christians were charged with incendiarism, cannibalism, and every infamy. (The student will find such heathen views of Christianity collected in my <span class="ital">Life of St Paul,</span> Exc. 15: Vol. 1.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the Son of man’s sake</span>] The hatred of men is not in itself a beatitude, because there is a general conscience which condemns certain forms of wickedness, and a man may justly incur universal execration. But the world also hates those who run counter to its pleasures and prejudices, and in that case hatred may be the tribute which vice pays to holiness; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-19.htm" title="For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.">1 Peter 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-14.htm" title="But and if you suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;">1 Peter 3:14</a>. “The world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-14.htm" title="I have given them your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.">John 17:14</a>. Still a man may well tremble when he is enjoying throughout life a beatitude of benediction. And ‘the world’ by no means excludes the so-called ‘religious world,’ which has hated with a still fiercer hatred, and exposed to a yet deadlier martyrdom, some of its greatest prophets and teachers. Not a few of the great and holy men enumerated in the next note fell a victim to the fury of priests. Our Lord was handed over to crucifixion by the unanimous hatred of the highest religious authorities of His day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the title Son of Man, which occurs in all the four Gospels, see p. 119. In using it Christ “chooses for Himself that title which definitely presents His work in relation to humanity in itself, and not primarily in relation to God or to the chosen people, or even to humanity as fallen.” Canon Westcott (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>) considers that it was not distinctively a Messianic title, and doubts its having been derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>. “The Son of God was made a Son of Man that you who were sons of men might be made sons of God.” Aug. <span class="ital">Serm.</span> 121. As the “Second Adam” Christ is the representative of the race (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>) in its highest ideal; as “the Lord from Heaven” He is the Promise of its future exaltation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-22.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.">Luke 6:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐκβάλωσι</span>, <span class="ital">cast out</span>) defaming you in the way of contumelies in public and private.

These words would be repeated by many a brave confessor in the days when persecution, at the hands of a far stronger and more far-reaching government than that of Jerusalem, should be the general lot of his followers. We find from pagan <span class="cmt_word">writers</span> of the next age that Christians were charged with plotting every vile and detestable crime that could be conceived against man-. kind (see, for instance, the historian Tacitus,  'Annal.,' 15:44; Suetonius, 'Nero.,' 16). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>.<p>Son of Man<p>The phrase is employed in the Old Testament as a circumlocution for man, with special reference to his frailty as contrasted with God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-6.htm">Job 25:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-8.htm">Job 35:8</a>; and eighty-nine times in Ezekiel). It had also a Messianic meaning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a> sq.), to which our Lord referred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>. It was the title which Christ most frequently applied to himself; and there are but two instances in which it is applied to him by another, viz., by Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>) and by John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a> :); and when acquiescing in the title "Son of God," addressed to himself, he sometimes immediately after substitutes "Son of Man" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-50.htm">John 1:50</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>).<p>The title asserts Christ's humanity - his absolute identification with our race: "his having a genuine humanity which could deem nothing human strange, and could be touched with a feeling of the infirmities of the race which he was to judge" (Liddon, "Our Lord's Divinity"). It also exalts him as the representative ideal man. "All human history tends to him and radiates from him; he is the point in which humanity finds its unity; as St. Irenaeus says, ' He recapitulates it.' He closes the earlier history of our race; he inaugurates its future. Nothing local, transient, individualizing, national, sectarian dwarfs the proportions of his world-embracing character. He rises above the parentage, the blood, the narrow horizon which bounded, as it seemed, his human life. He is the archetypal man, in whose presence distinction of race, intervals of ages, types of civilization, degrees of mental culture are as nothing" (Liddon).<p>But the title means more. As Son of Man he asserts the authority of judgment over all flesh. By virtue of what he is as Son of Man, he must be more. "The absolute relation to the world which he attributes to himself demands an absolute relation to God....He is the Son of Man, the Lord of the world, the Judge, only because he is the Son of God" (Luthardt). Christ's humanity can be explained only by his divinity. A humanity so unique demands a solution. Divested of all that is popularly called miraculous, viewed simply as a man, under the historical conditions of his life, he is a greater miracle than all his miracles combined. The solution is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-14</a>. </body></html>
