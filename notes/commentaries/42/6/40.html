The connection of thought is somewhat obscure, and we may not unreasonably believe that some links have been omitted. As it is, however, we can infer something from what precedes and follows. We are still in that section of the discourse which warns the disciples against taking on themselves the office of a judge. They were in this to follow the example of their Master. He, in His work on earth, taught, but did not judge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-11.htm" title="She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you: go, and sin no more.">John 8:11-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-47.htm" title="And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.">John 12:47</a>; perhaps, also, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-14.htm" title="And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?">Luke 12:14</a>). Were they above their Master that they should do what He had refrained from doing?<p><span class= "bld">Every one that is perfect.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">every one that is perfected.</span> The marginal rendering, “Every one shall be perfected,” is hardly tenable grammatically The implied thought is that the disciple or scholar who has been perfected by the education through which his Master has led him, will be like the Master in character and temper, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in this special application of the maxim, will abstain from needless, or hasty, or uncharitable judgment.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:37-49 All these sayings Christ often used; it was easy to apply them. We ought to be very careful when we blame others; for we need allowance ourselves. If we are of a giving and a forgiving spirit, we shall ourselves reap the benefit. Though full and exact returns are made in another world, not in this world, yet Providence does what should encourage us in doing good. Those who follow the multitude to do evil, follow in the broad way that leads to destruction. The tree is known by its fruits; may the word of Christ be so grafted in our hearts, that we may be fruitful in every good word and work. And what the mouth commonly speaks, generally agrees with what is most in the heart. Those only make sure work for their souls and eternity, and take the course that will profit in a trying time, who think, speak, and act according to the words of Christ. Those who take pains in religion, found their hope upon Christ, who is the Rock of Ages, and other foundation can no man lay. In death and judgment they are safe, being kept by the power of Christ through faith unto salvation, and they shall never perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The disciple is not ... - The learner is not above his teacher, does not know more, and must expect to fare no better. This seems to have been spoken to show them that they were not to expect that their disciples would go "beyond them" in attainments; that if they were blind, their followers would be also; and that therefore it was important for them to understand fully the doctrines of the gospel, and not to be blind leaders of the blind.<p>Every one that is perfect - The word rendered "is perfect" means sometimes to repair or mend, and is thus applied to mending nets, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-21.htm">Matthew 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19</a>. Hence, it means to repair or amend in a moral sense, or to make whole or complete. Here it means, evidently, "thoroughly instructed" or "informed." The Christian should be like his Master - holy, harmless, and undefiled, and separate from sinners. He should copy his example, and grow into the likeness of his Redeemer. Nor can any other be a Christian.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40. The disciple, &c.&#8212;that is, "The disciple aims to come up to his master, and he thinks himself complete when he does so: if you then be blind leaders of the blind, the perfection of one's training under you will only land him the more certainly in one common ruin with yourselves."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This was another common saying, which our Saviour applies, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-24.htm" title="The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.">Matthew 10:24</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-20.htm" title="Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord.

Some apply this with reference to the Pharisees, and so make a connexion between this and the former verse, where he had said, If the blind lead the blind, they shall both fall into the ditch; for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the disciple is not above his master, </span> none must look to learn of another more than the teacher knoweth himself. But it is better applied to Christ, and is as much as if our Lord had said, I am your Master, you are my disciples, and by that relation engaged to learn of me, and to follow me. I have taught you no more than I am ready to practise; I am merciful, I forgive, I give, looking for nothing again. I do not look that you should do any thing above me, any thing as to which I have not set you, or shall not set you, an example; but your perfection lieth in coming as near to me as you can, in being as your Master. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The disciple is not above his master,.... Or "more excellent", as the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions render it; that is, in learning and knowledge; if the master is ignorant, the scholar will be so too; and thus it is with teachers, and their people under their care; if the leaders are blind and ignorant, those under their instructions will remain so likewise. These words are an illustration of the preceding parable, and are used to another purpose here than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>. See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>. <p>but every one that is perfect shall be as his master. The Vulgate Latin reads it, "every one shall be perfect if he is as his master"; that is, if his master is a man of general learning, and a complete scholar, if he is like him, he will be so too: the Persic version renders it, "every disciple that desires perfection shall be as his master": whoever is ambitious of being a thorough scholar, and is diligent and industrious, by all ways and means, to obtain such a character, shall be even as good an one as his master, under whom he learns, and better he cannot well expect to be; and this is sufficient; and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "is it not enough that every one be as his master?" agreeably to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-25.htm">Matthew 10:25</a><p>Maimonides (i) has an expression much like this: <p>"he that learns, shall not be greater than he of whom he learns, but shall be,  "as he".'' <p>Christ, in this last clause, seems to design his own disciples, who, when perfect in knowledge, which is not to be expected in this state, unless in a comparative sense, will be like himself. <p>(i) Misn.

The <span class="ital">rationale</span> of the preceding statement: <span class="ital">Both</span> shall fall into a ditch,—therefore not merely the teacher, <span class="ital">but the disciple also</span>. Otherwise the disciple must <span class="ital">surpass</span> his teacher—a result which, even in the most fortunate circumstances, is not usually attained. This is thus expressed: <span class="ital">A disciple is not above his teacher, but every one that is fully prepared shall be</span> AS <span class="ital">his teacher, i.e.</span> when he has received the complete preparation in the school of his teacher he will be <span class="ital">equal</span> to his teacher. He will not <span class="ital">surpass</span> him. But the disciple must <span class="ital">surpass</span> his teacher (in knowledge, wisdom, disposition, etc.) if he were not to fall into perdition along with him. The view: <span class="ital">he will be trained as his teacher</span> (Kuinoel, de Wette, Bleek, and others), <span class="ital">i.e.</span> he will be like him in knowledge, disposition, etc., satisfies neither the idea of the specially chosen word <span class="greekheb">κατηρτ</span>., nor its emphatic position, nor the correlation of <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>.
