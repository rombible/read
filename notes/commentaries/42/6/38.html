We ought to be very careful when we blame others; for we need allowance ourselves. If we are of a giving and a forgiving spirit, we shall ourselves reap the benefit. Though full and exact returns are made in another world, not in this world, yet Providence does what should encourage us in doing good. Those who follow the multitude to do evil, follow in the broad way that leads to destruction. The tree is known by its fruits; may the word of Christ be so grafted in our hearts, that we may be fruitful in every good word and work. And what the mouth commonly speaks, generally agrees with what is most in the heart. Those only make sure work for their souls and eternity, and take the course that will profit in a trying time, who think, speak, and act according to the words of Christ. Those who take pains in religion, found their hope upon Christ, who is the Rock of Ages, and other foundation can no man lay. In death and judgment they are safe, being kept by the power of Christ through faith unto salvation, and they shall never perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Good measure - They shall give you good measure, or "full" measure.<p>Pressed down - As figs or grapes might be, and thus many more might be put into the measure.<p>Shaken together - To make it more compact, and thus to give more.<p>Running over - So full that the measure would overflow.<p>Shall men give - This is said to be the reward of "giving" to the poor and needy; and the meaning is that the man who is liberal will find others liberal to him in dealing with them, and when he is also in circumstances of want.

So as that which is here promised, is a plentiful reward to charitable and merciful actions, either from the hand of God more mediately, God stirring up others to be as kind to us as we are to others; or more immediately, himself blessing us by his unexpected providential dispensations: to this purpose are abundance of scriptures, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-19.htm" title="When you cut down your harvest in your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.">Deu 24:19</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/41-1.htm" title="Blessed is he that considers the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble....">Psalm 41:1-3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-25.htm" title="The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that waters shall be watered also himself.">Proverbs 11:25</a> 28:27 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="But this I say, He which sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully.">2 Corinthians 9:6</a></span>. If men will not be so just as to requite the good which their brethren have done them, having it in their power, yet God will be faithful to his promises, and by his providence take care that those who have done acts of mercy, not in a mere commiseration to human condition, but in a just obedience to his will, shall not lose by what they have done; they shall be rewarded fully and plentifully, finding again (though it may be after many days) the bread which they have cast upon the waters, according to his command. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Give, and it shall be given unto you,....

The allusion is to dry measure among the Jews, for to liquids, the terms used will not agree; and which, though right and full, which is here called good measure, they thrust and pressed to make it hold more; and shook it also for the same purpose, and then heaped it up as much as they could, till it fell over: of all these methods used in measuring, we have instances in their writings; which may serve to illustrate this passage: it is said of (a) one, that <p>"he measured, , "with measure pressed down"; and therefore they measured to him, with measure pressed down.'' <p>Some of their measures they heaped, and some they did not: they say (b); <p>"all the measures which were in the sanctuary, "were heaped", except the high priest's, and his heap was contained in it.'' <p>And elsewhere they observe (c) that <p>"there were two decimaries (or tithing vessels) in the sanctuary, one was  "heaped", and the other was  "stricken": with that which was heaped they measured all the fine flour for the meat offerings, and with the stricken, that which was for the cakes of the high priest.'' <p>With respect to this distinction of measures, they say it is a tradition of the Rabbins (d), that they do not "strike" in the place where <p>"they "heap", nor heap in the place where, they strike.'' <p>Between these two measures there was another, which was full measure and just, and right, without heaping or striking (e), R. Papa inquired, whether the handful <p>"(of sweet incense the high priest took on the day of atonement) which is spoken of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a> was of "stricken" or "heaped" measure; R. Abba said to R. Ase, come, hear, the handful spoken of, is neither of stricken nor heaped measure, , "but of equal measure";'' <p>sufficiently full, and no more. Dr. Lightfoot reads it,  "flowing over"; by what authority I cannot say; though the gloss says, the word signifies, <p>"flowing over, by reason of its height,'' <p>But flowing or running over measure, was the same with that which was heaped, as appears from the following instance (f): <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.
