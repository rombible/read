Forbid not thy coat </span>— That is, rather yield to his repeating the affront, or injury, than gratify resentment in righting yourself, in any method not becoming Christian love. <span class="ital">Give to every man </span>— Friend or enemy, what thou canst spare, and he really wants; <span class="ital">and of him that taketh away thy goods </span>— By borrowing; <span class="ital">ask them not again </span>— If he be insolvent: or, do not exact them if it will distress the person concerned to repay thee: rather lose them, if consistent with other duties, than demand them by a legal process. Dr. Doddridge translates and paraphrases the clause thus: “<span class="ital">From him that taketh away thy possessions, </span>in an injurious manner, <span class="ital">do not </span>immediately <span class="ital">demand them back </span>in the forms of law, but rather endeavour, by gentle methods, to reduce the offender to reason.” The Greek expression, <span class="greekheb">του αιροντος τα σα</span>, here rendered, <span class="ital">taketh away thy goods, </span>properly signifies, taketh them away violently, or by fraud. But, as Dr. Macknight observes, “Whatever sense we put on our Lord’s precept, it must be understood with the limitations which common sense directs us to make; namely, that we give and lend freely to all who ask, or permit them to retain what they have unjustly taken, provided only that it be a thing of small account, which we can easily spare, and the persons who ask or take such things be in real necessity.” <span class="ital">And as ye would that men should do unto you, </span>&c. — See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-12.htm" title="Therefore all things whatever you would that men should do to you, do you even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.">Matthew 7:12</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:27-36 These are hard lessons to flesh and blood.

No reasonable, thoughtful man would feel himself bound to the letter of these commandments. Our Lord, for instance, himself did not offer himself to be stricken again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-22.htm">John 18:22, 23</a>), but firmly, though with exquisite courtesy, rebuked the one who struck him. St. Paul, too (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a>), never dreamed of obeying the letter of this charge. It is but an assertion of a great principle, and so, with the exception of a very few mistaken fanatics, all the great teachers of Christianity have understood it. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Cheek (&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;)<p>Lit., the jaw.
