In "reply" to their question, Jesus asked them whether they would not release a "sheep" on the Sabbath-day if it was fallen into a pit, and also asked "them" whether it was better to do good than to do evil on that day, implying that to "omit" to do "good" was, in fact, doing "evil." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. good, or &#8230; evil, save &#8230; or destroy&#8212;By this novel way of putting His case, our Lord teaches the great ethical principle, that to neglect any opportunity of doing good is to incur the guilt of doing evil; and by this law He bound His own spirit.

How could he stretch out that withered, powerless limb? But with the command went forth the power. In other words, "Stretch forth that poor hand of thine; thou canst now, for, lo! the disease is gone." And we read that he did so, and as he stretched out the limb, so long powerless, the man discovered and the people saw that the cure was already performed. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Thy hand<p>The arm was not withered. </body></html>
