Possibly, however, his very acquaintance with the men so named may have made him reluctant to give a special prominence to the part they had taken against the Christ. St. Mark, it will be remembered, says that they “took counsel” (or, <span class= "ital">held a council</span>) that they might destroy Him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:6-11 Christ was neither ashamed nor afraid to own the purposes of his grace.

St Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-14.htm" title="And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?">Luke 12:14</a>) says that they actually “held a council against Him.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">what they might do</span>] The form used—what is called the Aeolic aorist—implies extreme perplexity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-11.htm" title="And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.">Luke 6:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀνοίας</span>, <span class="ital">with madness</span>) And yet at that very time they had good reason to have come to their senses spiritually [they were filled with <span class="greekheb">ἀνοία</span>, whereas they needed <span class="greekheb">μετανοία</span>].<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</span> The storm was already gathering. From this time we gather from the words of SS. Matthew and Mark, that in the minds of others as well as in the mind of Jesus, the thought of his death was ever present. The thought-leaders of the Jews - the men whose position was secured as long as the rabbinic teaching held sway in the hearts of the people, but no longer - from this hour resolved upon the death of that strange mighty Reformer. He was, said they, an impostor, a fanatic; one who led men's minds astray. Had they no doubts, we ask; no qualms of conscience, no deep searchings of heart?
