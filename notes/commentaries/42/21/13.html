St. Luke is one, and the other is St. Paul, in a passage so closely parallel to this as to read almost like an echo of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Philippians 1:19</a>). The “testimony” is defined by <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-9.htm" title="But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues you shall be beaten: and you shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.">Mark 13:9</a>, as being borne to the kings and rulers before whom the disciples were to stand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/21-13.htm" title="And it shall turn to you for a testimony....">Luke 21:13-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">It shall turn to you for a testimony </span>— The persecutions which you suffer shall become a glorious proof both of your innocence and of their guilt in rejecting the gospel. <span class="ital">Settle it, therefore, in your hearts, </span>&c. — As the Holy Ghost will assist you in your defences, let it be a fixed point with you, <span class="ital">not to meditate before what ye shall answer. </span>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-19.htm" title="But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what you shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak.">Matthew 10:19</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-11.htm" title="But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what you shall speak, neither do you premeditate: but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak you: for it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost.">Mark 13:11</a>. <span class="ital">I will give you a mouth and wisdom, </span>&c. — “I will suggest to you such sentiments, and enable you to deliver them with such eloquence, that your defences shall be unanswerable; and your adversaries shall be struck with them, especially when they find by your manner that you have spoken without premeditation.” Of the fulfilment of this promise, we have evident examples in the defences made by the proto- martyr, Stephen, and by the Apostle Paul, especially before King Agrippa and the Roman governors. But there is no need to insist upon particulars. The prevalency of the gospel, wherever it was preached, demonstrates, beyond all doubt, that the defences made by the preachers thereof were unanswerable. <span class="ital">Ye shall be betrayed by parents and brethren, </span>&c. — See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-22.htm" title="And you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he that endures to the end shall be saved.">Matthew 10:22</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/13-12.htm" title="Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death....">Mark 13:12-13</a>. <span class="ital">There shall not a hair of your head perish </span>— A proverbial expression denoting absolute safety. The special providence of God shall watch over you for your preservation, and you shall not suffer before the time appointed by God, nor without a full reward. But the promise seems to refer especially to their preservation during the siege of Jerusalem; of which, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-20.htm" title="And when you shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is near.">Luke 21:20</a>. Thus Jesus encouraged all to steadfastness in the midst of the fiery trial that was to try them. <span class="ital">In patience possess ye your souls </span>— Be calm and serene, masters of yourselves, and superior to all irrational and disquieting passions. By keeping the government of your spirits, you will both avoid much misery, and guard the better against all dangers.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:5-28 With much curiosity those about Christ ask as to the time when the great desolation should be. He answers with clearness and fulness, as far as was necessary to teach them their duty; for all knowledge is desirable as far as it is in order to practice. Though spiritual judgements are the most common in gospel times, yet God makes use of temporal judgments also. Christ tells them what hard things they should suffer for his name's sake, and encourages them to bear up under their trials, and to go on in their work, notwithstanding the opposition they would meet with. God will stand by you, and own you, and assist you. This was remarkably fulfilled after the pouring out of the Spirit, by whom Christ gave his disciples wisdom and utterance. Though we may be losers for Christ, we shall not, we cannot be losers by him, in the end. It is our duty and interest at all times, especially in perilous, trying times, to secure the safety of our own souls. It is by Christian patience we keep possession of our own souls, and keep out all those impressions which would put us out of temper. We may view the prophecy before us much as those Old Testament prophecies, which, together with their great object, embrace, or glance at some nearer object of importance to the church. Having given an idea of the times for about thirty-eight years next to come, Christ shows what all those things would end in, namely, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the utter dispersion of the Jewish nation; which would be a type and figure of Christ's second coming. The scattered Jews around us preach the truth of Christianity; and prove, that though heaven and earth shall pass away, the words of Jesus shall not pass away. They also remind us to pray for those times when neither the real, nor the spiritual Jerusalem, shall any longer be trodden down by the Gentiles, and when both Jews and Gentiles shall be turned to the Lord. When Christ came to destroy the Jews, he came to redeem the Christians that were persecuted and oppressed by them; and then had the churches rest. When he comes to judge the world, he will redeem all that are his from their troubles. So fully did the Divine judgements come upon the Jews, that their city is set as an example before us, to show that sins will not pass unpunished; and that the terrors of the Lord, and his threatenings against impenitent sinners, will all come to pass, even as his word was true, and his wrath great upon Jerusalem.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Synagogues, and into prisons - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/13-9.htm">Mark 13:9-10</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. for a testimony&#8212;an opportunity of bearing testimony.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That is, your persecution shall <span class="bld">turn to you for a testimony:</span> for a testimony against your adversaries; so as they themselves shall be brought by your confession of me to own me as the true Messiah; and their cruelty, which they mask under the vizor of religion, shall be openly detected, and it shall at last appear to all the world, that the judgments of God are just, for the cruelty they have exercised upon you.

By this means they would have an opportunity of leaving their testimony for Christ before kings and rulers; and what they should meet with from them, would be a means of strengthening and confirming them in the truths of the Gospel; and be a proof and evidence to them of the certainty of the above things Christ had said should be accomplished; as well as be for a testimony against the rulers and governors, Jews, and Gentiles, before whom they should be convened; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it shall turn to you for <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> a testimony.</span><p>(c) This will be the result of your troubles and afflictions: they will be witnesses both before God and man of the treacherous and cruel dealing of your enemies, as well as of your steadfastness: A noble saying, that the afflictions of the godly and holy men pertain to the witness of the truth.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-13.htm" title="And it shall turn to you for a testimony.">Luke 21:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀποβήσεται</span>, it will turn out; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm" title="For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,">Php 1:19</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν εἰς μαρτύριον</span>, for a testimony to you = to your credit or honour; = <span class="greekheb">εἰς μαρτυρίου δόξαν</span>, Theophy.
