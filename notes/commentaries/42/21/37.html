Strictly speaking, it meant to lodge, not in a room, but in the court-yard of a house; and so was used generally, in military language, for a “bivouac.” It would seem to have been chosen by both Evangelists (it does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament) to include the fact, implied in all four and definitely stated by St. John, that most of the nights were spent not in a house, but in the garden, or orchard, of Gethsemane (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/18-1.htm" title="When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples.">John 18:1-2</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That is called the mount of Olives.</span>—Better, perhaps, here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,">Luke 19:29</a> (where see Note), <span class= "ital">that is called Olivet.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/21-37.htm" title="And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went out, and stayed in the mount that is called the mount of Olives....">Luke 21:37-38</a></span>. <span class="ital">And in the day-time he was teaching in the temple </span>— “His daily custom at this, and it may be at other passovers, was to spend the day in the city, most commonly in the temple, where he always found a great concourse of hearers, and in the evening to retire to the mount of Olives, where he lodged in the villages, or in the gardens, or in the open air among the trees. He chose to lodge at night in such places as these, that he might avoid falling into the hands of his enemies. For though they durst not attack him in the midst of his followers by day, they probably would have apprehended him during the silence and darkness of the night, had he lodged anywhere within the walls of the town. Accordingly they did not venture to lay hands on him, till Judas Iscariot, one of his own disciples, betrayed him to them, in the absence of the multitude, by conducting an armed band to the place of his retirement.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple — </span>The evangelist does not say, that the people came and heard Jesus preach in the temple after this time, for Jesus himself had declared that he never was to preach to them any more, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-38.htm" title="Behold, your house is left to you desolate....">Matthew 23:38-39</a>. But having described in what manner our Lord spent his time at this passover, the evangelist adds, that his ministry sustained no damage by his leaving the city at night, because he did not fail to return every morning to the temple, and because a great number of people came thither early to be instructed by him, knowing that it was his custom to be there betimes. “How much happier,” says Dr. Doddridge, “were his disciples in these early lectures, than the slumbers of the morning would have made them on their beds! Let us not scruple to deny ourselves the indulgence of unnecessary sleep, that we may, morning after morning, place ourselves at his feet, and lose no opportunity of receiving the instructions of his word, and seeking those of his Spirit.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:29-38 Christ tells his disciples to observe the signs of the times, which they might judge by. He charges them to look upon the ruin of the Jewish nation as near. Yet this race and family of Abraham shall not be rooted out; it shall survive as a nation, and be found as prophesied, when the Son of man shall be revealed. He cautions them against being secure and sensual. This command is given to all Christ's disciples, Take heed to yourselves, that ye be not overpowered by temptations, nor betrayed by your own corruptions. We cannot be safe, if we are carnally secure. Our danger is, lest the day of death and of judgment should come upon us when we are not prepared. Lest, when we are called to meet our Lord, that be the furthest from our thoughts, which ought to be nearest our hearts. For so it will come upon the most of men, who dwell upon the earth, and mind earthly things only, and have no converse with heaven. It will be a terror and a destruction to them. Here see what should be our aim, that we may be accounted worthy to escape all those things; that when the judgements of God are abroad, we may not be in the common calamity, or it may not be that to us which it is to others. Do you ask how you may be found worthy to stand before Christ at that day? Those who never yet sought Christ, let them now go unto him; those who never yet were humbled for their sins, let them now begin; those who have already begun, let them go forward and be kept humbled. Watch therefore, and pray always. Watch against sin; watch in every duty, and make the most of every opportunity to do good. Pray always: those shall be accounted worthy to live a life of praise in the other world, who live a life of prayer in this world. May we begin, employ, and conclude each day attending to Christ's word, obeying his precepts, and following his example, that whenever he comes we may be found watching.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-17.htm">Matthew 21:17</a>.<p>Came early in the morning - He returned early from the Mount of Olives, and taught in the temple. Our Saviour did not waste his mornings in idleness or sleep. He rose early and repaired to the temple. The people, also, flocked to the sanctuary to hear him. This example is at once an encouragement to early rising and to the early worship of God. It is a reproof of those who spend the part of the day best fitted for devotion in unnecessary sleep; and it shows the propriety, where it can be done, of assembling early in the morning for prayer and the worship of God. Early prayer-meetings have the countenance of the Saviour, and will be found to be eminently conducive to the promotion of religion. The whole example of Jesus goes to show the importance of beginning the day with God, and of lifting up the heart to him for direction, for the supply of our wants, and for preservation from temptation, before the mind is engrossed by the cares, and distracted by the perplexities, and led away by the temptations of this life. Commencing the day with God is like arresting evil at the fountain; prayer at any other time, without this, is an attempt to arrest it when it has swollen to a stream and rolls on like a torrent. Let the day be begun with God, and the work of piety is easy. Let the world have the ascendency in the morning, and it will be likely to have it also at noonday and at evening. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37, 38. in the daytime&#8212;of this His last week.<p>abode in the mount&#8212;that is, at Bethany (Mt 21:17).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 37,38 In these two verses our evangelist letteth us knew how Christ spent those few days which he had yet to live.

There is even now a general historical communication upon those last days of Jesus in Jerusalem, from which it is plain that according to Luke He still continued to teach in the temple. There is a difference from Matthew (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-1.htm" title="And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!">Mark 13:1</a>), according to whom He is no longer in the temple when He delivers His eschatological discourse, and does not again set foot in it after <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-39.htm" title="And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If you be Christ, save yourself and us.">Luke 23:39</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐλαιών</span>] Thus to be accented in this place also.
