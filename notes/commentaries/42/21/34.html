We note in it, as such, that, as far as the New Testament is concerned, St. Luke only uses the words for “overcharged” and “surfeiting” (the latter word belonged, more or less, to the vocabulary of medical science); St. Luke and St. Paul alone those for “drunkenness” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-21.htm" title="Contentions, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.">Galatians 5:21</a>), and cares “of this life” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-3.htm" title="Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?">1Corinthians 6:3-4</a>), and “unawares” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm" title="For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.">1Thessalonians 5:3</a>). In the last passage we have what reads almost like a distinct echo from this verse. The whole passage, it may be noted, falls in with St. Luke’s characteristic tendency to record all portions of our Lord’s teaching that warned men against sensuality and worldliness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/21-34.htm" title="And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come on you unawares....">Luke 21:34-36</a></span>. <span class="ital">Take heed, </span>&c. — Here our Lord cautions them against the security and sensuality, to which, if they should yield, they would unfit themselves for the trying times that were approaching, and would render those times a great surprise and terror to them; nay, and involve themselves in the ruin about to come on others of their countrymen. By this we learn, 1st, That Christ’s promises of deliverance to his disciples and the first Christians were conditional, and only to be fulfilled, provided that, through divine grace, they made it their care to guard against those sins which would have exposed them to God’s judgments: and, 2d, That there is a close connection between our duty and safety; between our obedience to God and the divine aid and providence, for our preservation, whether temporal or spiritual: and that we are not to expect preservation immediately from his hand, without the use of those means which he has put it into our power to use in order to it. <span class="ital">Lest at any time your hearts be overcharged, </span>&c. — The original word <span class="greekheb">βαρυνθωσιν</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">overcharged, </span>properly signifies <span class="ital">burdened, </span>or, <span class="ital">pressed down, </span>and so very elegantly and strongly expresses the hateful consequences of intemperance; and the load which it brings on those rational faculties, which are the glory of the human nature. Thus Horace, —<span class="bld"><span class="ital"> corpus onustum Hesternis vitiis animum quoque prægravat unà, Atque affigit humo divinæ particulam auræ. SAT. 2. lib. 2. lin. 77.</span></span> The immoderate use of meat and drink not only burdens the mind with the guilt thereby contracted, but it renders it dull, stupid, and lifeless in duty, and indeed unfit for prayer and praise, for the exercise of any grace, and the practice of any virtue: nay, it stupifies the conscience, and renders the heart unaffected with those things that are most affecting. <span class="ital">And cares of this life </span>— Anxious cares about visible and temporal things, and the inordinate pursuit of them. The former is the snare of those that are given to their pleasures; this is the snare of the men of business that will be rich. Observe, reader, we have need to guard against both, also against all other temptations, lest at any time our hearts should be thus overcharged. Our caution against sin, and our care of our own souls, must be constant. But was there need to warn the apostles themselves against such sins as these? Then surely there is need to warn even strong Christians against the very grossest sins. Neither are we wise if we think ourselves out of the reach of any sin. <span class="ital">And so that day </span>— That awful and important time, of which he had been speaking, when these dreadful calamities should come upon that nation; and overwhelm the unwary and carnally secure. <span class="ital">For as a snare, </span>&c. — For the character of the generality of people in the Jewish nation, at that time, would be such that this ruin <span class="ital">would come on all </span>— Or on the greatest part of all; <span class="ital">that dwelt on the face of the whole earth </span>— Or, of <span class="ital">the whole land, as a snare </span>upon a thoughtless bird, which, in the midst of its security, finds itself inextricably taken. Thus should we <span class="ital">take heed, </span>lest either the hour of death or day of judgment should come upon us, when we neither expect nor are prepared for such awful events. <span class="ital">Watch ye, therefore </span>— This is the general conclusion of all that precedes. Watch against every temptation to negligence and sin, and against every thing which might lull you into a dangerous security; <span class="ital">and pray always </span>— With the most fervent importunity; <span class="ital">that ye may be accounted worthy </span>— Through pardoning mercy, and the renewing, assisting grace of God; <span class="ital">to escape all these things</span> — Those calamitous and destructive events; <span class="ital">that shall </span>assuredly <span class="ital">come to pass </span>— In the very manner I have described them. <span class="ital">And stand before the Son of man </span>— With courage and acceptance, acquitted and approved as his servants, and may not fall before him as his enemies in that day of awful visitation. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm" title="Who are you that judge another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls. Yes, he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand.">Romans 14:4</a>, <span class="ital">standing </span>and <span class="ital">falling </span>are terms used to signify the being approved or condemned. Those of our Lord’s disciples who followed his directions, and were faithful to the grace they had received, not only escaped the destruction coming on the great body of the Jewish nation, but were acknowledged as his servants, and appointed to be the ministers of his word, and the heralds of his grace and mercy to the Gentile nations. The expression, <span class="greekheb">καταξιωθητε</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">accounted worthy, </span>sometimes implies an honour conferred on a person, as when the apostles are said to be <span class="ital">counted worthy to suffer shame for Christ, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm" title="And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.">Acts 5:41</a>; some times the being meet or <span class="ital">fit </span>for any thing, or suitable thereto, as when John the Baptist exhorts to <span class="ital">bring forth fruits worthy of repentance, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-8.htm" title="Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Luke 3:8</a>. And so to <span class="ital">be accounted worthy to escape, </span>is, to have the honour of it, and to be fitted, or prepared for it. “The reader will observe that Luke’s account of this discourse is very short, in comparison with that of Matthew and Mark, for this obvious reason, that he had given the chief heads of it before, partly in a discourse of our Lord’s last coming, which was delivered to a very numerous assembly in Galilee, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/12-35.htm" title="Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;...">Luke 12:35-48</a>,) and partly in another discourse, relating only to the destruction of Jerusalem, which was delivered in his journey thither, at the feast of dedication, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-20.htm" title="And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:">Luke 17:20</a>, &c. Here, therefore, he chooses to omit what had been inserted on either of those occasions; as John, who probably wrote after the accomplishment of this prophecy, entirely omits it, as already so largely recorded by the former three, from whom, considering the circumstances of time, it came with infinitely better grace, than it could afterward have done from him.” — Doddridge. See notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-42.htm" title="Watch therefore: for you know not what hour your Lord does come....">Matthew 24:42-51</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/13-33.htm" title="Take you heed, watch and pray: for you know not when the time is....">Mark 13:33-37</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:29-38 Christ tells his disciples to observe the signs of the times, which they might judge by. He charges them to look upon the ruin of the Jewish nation as near. Yet this race and family of Abraham shall not be rooted out; it shall survive as a nation, and be found as prophesied, when the Son of man shall be revealed. He cautions them against being secure and sensual. This command is given to all Christ's disciples, Take heed to yourselves, that ye be not overpowered by temptations, nor betrayed by your own corruptions. We cannot be safe, if we are carnally secure. Our danger is, lest the day of death and of judgment should come upon us when we are not prepared. Lest, when we are called to meet our Lord, that be the furthest from our thoughts, which ought to be nearest our hearts. For so it will come upon the most of men, who dwell upon the earth, and mind earthly things only, and have no converse with heaven. It will be a terror and a destruction to them. Here see what should be our aim, that we may be accounted worthy to escape all those things; that when the judgements of God are abroad, we may not be in the common calamity, or it may not be that to us which it is to others. Do you ask how you may be found worthy to stand before Christ at that day? Those who never yet sought Christ, let them now go unto him; those who never yet were humbled for their sins, let them now begin; those who have already begun, let them go forward and be kept humbled. Watch therefore, and pray always. Watch against sin; watch in every duty, and make the most of every opportunity to do good. Pray always: those shall be accounted worthy to live a life of praise in the other world, who live a life of prayer in this world. May we begin, employ, and conclude each day attending to Christ's word, obeying his precepts, and following his example, that whenever he comes we may be found watching.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lest at any time your hearts be overcharged ... - The meaning of this verse is, "Be continually expecting these things. Do not forget them, and do not be "secure" and satisfied with this life and the good things which it furnishes. Do not suffer yourselves to be drawn into the fashions of the world; to be conformed to its customs; to partake of its feasts and revelry; and so these calamities shall come upon you when you least expect them." And from this we may learn - what alas! we may from the "lives" of many professing Christians - that there is need of cautioning the disciples of Jesus now that they do not indulge in the festivities of this life, and "forget" that they are to die and come to judgment. How many, alas! who bear the Christian name, have forgotten this caution of the Saviour, and live as if their lives were secure; as if they feared not death; as if there were no heaven and no judgment! Christians should feel that they are soon to die, and that their portion is not in this life; and, feeling this, they should be "looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God."<p>Overcharged - Literally, "be made heavy," as is the case with those who have eaten and drunken too much.<p>Surfeiting - Excessive eating and drinking, so as to oppress the body; indulgence in the pleasures of the table. This word does not include "intoxication," but merely indulgence in food and drink, though the food and drink should be in themselves lawful.<p>Drunkenness - Intoxication, intemperance in drinking. The ancients were not acquainted with the poison that we chiefly use on which to become drunk. They had no distilled spirits. They became intoxicated on wine, and strong drink made of a mixture of dates, honey, etc. All nations have contrived some way to become intoxicated - to bring in folly, and disease, and poverty, and death, by drunkenness; and in nothing is the depravity of men more manifest than in thus endeavoring to hasten the ravages of crime and death.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34-37. surfeiting, and drunkenness&#8212;All animal excesses, quenching spirituality.<p>cares of this life&#8212;(See on [1714]Mr 4:7; [1715]Mr 4:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 34-36.
