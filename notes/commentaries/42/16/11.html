Our Lord teaches His disciples, what human religious teachers have so often forgotten, that honesty, integrity, and, as implied in faithfulness, benevolence, in the use of this world’s goods, be our portion small or great, is an indispensable condition of all spiritual advancement.<p>The Greek word for “true” may be noticed as being that which is generally characteristic of St. John. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-23.htm" title="But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.">John 4:23</a>.) This is the only instance of its use in the three first Gospels; St. Paul uses it once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm" title="For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;">1Thessalonians 1:9</a>), and then, after companionship with St. Luke. It is found in three passages of the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm" title="A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.">Hebrews 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm" title="For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:">Hebrews 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>) twenty-three times in the writings of St. John.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-12 Whatever we have, the property of it is God's; we have only the use of it, according to the direction of our great Lord, and for his honour. This steward wasted his lord's goods. And we are all liable to the same charge; we have not made due improvement of what God has trusted us with. The steward cannot deny it; he must make up his accounts, and be gone. This may teach us that death will come, and deprive us of the opportunities we now have. The steward will make friends of his lord's debtors or tenants, by striking off a considerable part of their debt to his lord. The lord referred to in this parable commended not the fraud, but the policy of the steward. In that respect alone is it so noticed. Worldly men, in the choice of their object, are foolish; but in their activity, and perseverance, they are often wiser than believers. The unjust steward is not set before us as an example in cheating his master, or to justify any dishonesty, but to point out the careful ways of worldly men. It would be well if the children of light would learn wisdom from the men of the world, and would as earnestly pursue their better object. The true riches signify spiritual blessings; and if a man spends upon himself, or hoards up what God has trusted to him, as to outward things, what evidence can he have, that he is an heir of God through Christ? The riches of this world are deceitful and uncertain. Let us be convinced that those are truly rich, and very rich, who are rich in faith, and rich toward God, rich in Christ, in the promises; let us then lay up our treasure in heaven, and expect our portion from thence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who will commit ... - If you are not faithful in the small matters pertaining to this world, if you do not use aright your property and influence, you cannot expect that God will commit to you the true riches of his grace. Men who are dishonest and worldly, and who do not employ the deceitful mammon as they ought, cannot expect to grow in grace. God does not confer grace upon them, and their being unfaithful in earthly matters is evidence that they "would be" also in much greater affairs, and would likewise "misimprove" the true riches.<p>True riches - The graces of the gospel; the influences of the Spirit; eternal life, or religion. The riches of this world are false, deceitful, not to be trusted <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>; the treasures of heaven are "true," faithful, never-failing, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11, 12. unrighteous mammon&#8212;To the whole of this He applies the disparaging term "what is least," in contrast with "the true riches."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse now opposeth <span class="bld">the unrighteous mammon</span> to <span class="bld">the true riches</span>, which would strongly incline one to think, that by <span class="bld">the mammon of unrighteousness</span>, before mentioned, our Saviour meant only false and deceitful riches. By the <span class="bld">true riches</span> I cannot think is meant the gospel, which indeed is said to be committed to trust of the ministers, but not of all Christians. I had rather interpret it of special, effectual grace, which is of all other the true riches: and so it teacheth us this great truth, That God is justified in the denial of his special grace to those who do not make a due use of his common gifts and grace; and indeed here will lie men’s damnation, because they do not make a just use of that common grace which they have, and might make a better use of it than they do. If they would be faithful in that, God would not deny them the true riches. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If therefore ye have not been faithful,.... This is the application of the above proverbial expressions, and seems to be directed to the disciples of Christ, though not without a view to the covetous Scribes and Pharisees, who were in hearing of it, and were disturbed at it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-14.htm">Luke 16:14</a> and the meaning is, that whereas some of them might have been unfaithful, and have acted the unjust part of gathering of riches, as Matthew, and other publicans, that were now become the followers of Christ; if therefore they should be unfaithful <p>in the unrighteous mammon; in the disposing of it to improper uses, which was either unrighteously gotten, and therefore called, as it sometimes was, , "mammon of ungodliness", or "ungodly mammon" (x); or, which was fallacious, deceitful, vain, and transitory: <p>who will commit to your trust the true riches; or mammon? that is, how should you expect to be intrusted with the riches of grace, as the blessings and promises of the covenant of grace, the graces of the Spirit of God, which truly enrich persons, and are solid and durable? or the riches of glory, the better and more enduring substance in heaven, signified by a kingdom, and an inheritance that fadeth not away? so the Jews call the good things of another world, and say (y), that <p>"all the good things of this world are not , "true good things", in comparison of the good things of the world to come.'' <p>And they use the same distinction with respect to "mammon", as here: <p>"the holy, blessed God, they say (z), gives him,  , "mammon of truth", or true mammon; and he makes it  "false", or deceitful:'' <p>or rather the rich treasure of the Gospel is meant, called a treasure in earthen vessels, and the unsearchable riches of Christ; and is comparable to, and of more worth than gold, silver, and precious stones. And so the Syriac version renders it, "who will trust you with the truth?" with the truth of the Gospel. <p>(x) Targum in Hab. ii. 9.
