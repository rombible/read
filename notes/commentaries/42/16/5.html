Who, we ask, are the “debtors,” in the interpretation of the parable? The Lord’s Prayer supplies the answer to that question. The “debtors” are those who have sinned against God, who have left undone the things which they were bound to do, who have made no return for the outward blessings they have received. The unfaithful Church or party tries to secure its position by working on the lower nature of those who have the sense of that burden upon them. It neither gives the sense of peace or pardon, nor asserts the righteous severity of God’s commandments. It keeps their consciences uneasy, and traffics in its absolutions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/16-5.htm" title="So he called every one of his lord's debtors to him, and said to the first, How much owe you to my lord?...">Luke 16:5-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">So he called, </span>&c. — In pursuance of this scheme he sent for all those of his lord’s debtors whom he could hope to oblige by so fraudulent a proposal, determining to lower the several articles in his book, which stood chargeable to the account of each of them: <span class="ital">and said to the first, How much owest thou </span>— How much hast thou agreed to pay for the rent of the ground thou occupiest, or of how much hast thou acknowledged the receipt? <span class="ital">And he said, A hundred measures of oil </span>— The word <span class="greekheb">βατους</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">measures, </span>is evidently derived from the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">בתים</span>, which we render <span class="ital">baths, </span>in the Old Testament. According to Bishop Cumberland, a bath contained about seven gallons two quarts and half a pint. <span class="ital">And he said, Take thy bill </span>— <span class="greekheb">Σου το γραμμα</span>, <span class="ital">thy writing; </span>the writing in which thou hast promised the payment of so many baths as rent, or in which thou hast acknowledged the receipt of so many. The writing, whatever it was, was doubtless of the obligatory kind, and probably in the hand-writing of the tenant, or debtor, who thereby bound himself to pay these baths, and was signed by the steward, who here ordered him to alter, or write it over again, and make himself liable to pay only <span class="ital">fifty, </span>instead of <span class="ital">a hundred. </span>The word <span class="greekheb">κορους</span>, rendered <span class="ital">measures, </span>in the next verse, is the <span class="greekheb">כור</span>, or <span class="ital">homer, </span>of the Hebrews, containing about eight bushels and a half, standard measure. The twenty homers which he allowed the debtors to deduct, would contain one hundred and seventy bushels of wheat, and might be as valuable as fifty baths, or three hundred and seventy-eight gallons of oil; so that the obligation conferred on both those debtors might be equal.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-12 Whatever we have, the property of it is God's; we have only the use of it, according to the direction of our great Lord, and for his honour. This steward wasted his lord's goods. And we are all liable to the same charge; we have not made due improvement of what God has trusted us with. The steward cannot deny it; he must make up his accounts, and be gone. This may teach us that death will come, and deprive us of the opportunities we now have. The steward will make friends of his lord's debtors or tenants, by striking off a considerable part of their debt to his lord. The lord referred to in this parable commended not the fraud, but the policy of the steward. In that respect alone is it so noticed. Worldly men, in the choice of their object, are foolish; but in their activity, and perseverance, they are often wiser than believers. The unjust steward is not set before us as an example in cheating his master, or to justify any dishonesty, but to point out the careful ways of worldly men. It would be well if the children of light would learn wisdom from the men of the world, and would as earnestly pursue their better object. The true riches signify spiritual blessings; and if a man spends upon himself, or hoards up what God has trusted to him, as to outward things, what evidence can he have, that he is an heir of God through Christ? The riches of this world are deceitful and uncertain. Let us be convinced that those are truly rich, and very rich, who are rich in faith, and rich toward God, rich in Christ, in the promises; let us then lay up our treasure in heaven, and expect our portion from thence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Called every one - As he was "steward," he had the management of all the affairs, and, of course, debts were to be paid to him.<p>Debtors - Those who "owed" his master, or perhaps "tenants;" those who rented land of his master. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-7. fifty &#8230; fourscore&#8212;deducting a half from the debt of the one, and a fifth from that of the other.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 5 <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-1.htm" title="And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods.">Luke 16:1</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So he called every one of his Lord's debtors,....

This singular plan of providing for himself by becoming a benefactor of the debtor, remarks Professor Bruce, was by no means the only possible one under the circumstances; but the Speaker of the parable made his hero make choice of it as the aim of the imaginary narrative was to teach the value of beneficence as a passport into the eternal habitations. Various explanations have been suggested to account for the difference in the gifts to the debtors. It is probable that when our Lord spoke the parable, reasons for these varied gifts were given, such as the circumstances of the debtors. It is scarcely now worth while to frame ingenious guesses respecting the details, which apparently do not affect the grand lessons which the story was intended to teach. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He called<p>Alford and Trench think that the debtors were together; but the words seem to me to indicate that he dealt with them separately.
