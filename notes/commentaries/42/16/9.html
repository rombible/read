You cannot serve God and mammon.">Matthew 6:24</a>. The word was Syriac in its origin, and was found also, as Augustine testifies, in Punic. It was in common use in the Targums or Paraphrases of the Old Testament, in our Lord’s time, for “wealth” or “riches,” and possibly, as stated by Tertullian, whose authority, as a Carthaginian, may be admitted as of some weight, was applied to some Syrian deity who, like the Greek Plutus, was worshipped as wealth personified. If we admit this view, it explains, what otherwise it is not easy to explain, St. Luke’s introduction of the Syriac word instead of its Greek equivalent. “The mammon of unrighteousness,” the genitive having the same force as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8</a>, is the wealth to which that character for the most part attaches, wealth wrongly gained and wrongly spent. And yet “of that mammon”—or better, <span class= "ital">out of,</span> or <span class= "ital">with, the mammon</span>—men are to make friends. The right use of wealth in helping the poor, making men happier and better, leading them to repentance and to God, will gain for us friends, perhaps the very persons whom we have helped, perhaps the angels of God who rejoice over one sinner that repenteth, perhaps even Christ and the Father, who will receive us into “everlasting habitations.”<p><span class= "bld">That, when ye fail, . . .</span>—The better MSS. give “that when <span class= "ital">it fails,”</span> so the “mammon,” or riches, on which men set their hearts.<p><span class= "bld">Into everlasting habitations.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">everlasting tabernacles.</span> The word seems chosen, in contrast to the “houses” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-4.htm" title="I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.">Luke 16:4</a>, perhaps in contrast to the “booths” of leaves or branches, transitory and withering in a few days, which entered into the ritual of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm" title="And you shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.">Leviticus 23:40</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-15.htm" title="And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth to the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.">Nehemiah 8:15</a>), or with the “tents” which were the symbol of the transitory promises of the older Patriarchs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-9.htm" title="By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:">Hebrews 11:9</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-12 Whatever we have, the property of it is God's; we have only the use of it, according to the direction of our great Lord, and for his honour. This steward wasted his lord's goods. And we are all liable to the same charge; we have not made due improvement of what God has trusted us with. The steward cannot deny it; he must make up his accounts, and be gone. This may teach us that death will come, and deprive us of the opportunities we now have. The steward will make friends of his lord's debtors or tenants, by striking off a considerable part of their debt to his lord. The lord referred to in this parable commended not the fraud, but the policy of the steward. In that respect alone is it so noticed. Worldly men, in the choice of their object, are foolish; but in their activity, and perseverance, they are often wiser than believers. The unjust steward is not set before us as an example in cheating his master, or to justify any dishonesty, but to point out the careful ways of worldly men. It would be well if the children of light would learn wisdom from the men of the world, and would as earnestly pursue their better object. The true riches signify spiritual blessings; and if a man spends upon himself, or hoards up what God has trusted to him, as to outward things, what evidence can he have, that he is an heir of God through Christ? The riches of this world are deceitful and uncertain. Let us be convinced that those are truly rich, and very rich, who are rich in faith, and rich toward God, rich in Christ, in the promises; let us then lay up our treasure in heaven, and expect our portion from thence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I say unto you - I, Jesus, say to you, my disciples.<p>Make to yourselves friends - Some have understood the word "friends," here, as referring to the poor; others, to holy angels; and others, to God. Perhaps, however, the word should not be considered as referring to any particular "persons," but is used in accordance with the preceding parable; for in the application our Saviour uses the "language" appropriated to the conduct of the steward to express the "general" truth that we are to make a proper use of riches. The steward had so managed his pecuniary affairs as to secure future comfort for himself, or so as to find friends that would take care of him "beyond" the time when he was put out of the office. That is, he would not be destitute, or cast off, or without comfort, when he was removed from his office. So, says our Saviour to the publicans and those who had property, so use your property as "to secure" happiness and comfort beyond the time when you shall be removed from the present life. "Have reference," in the use of your money, to the future.<p>Do not use it so that it shall not avail you anything hereafter; but so employ it that, as the steward found friends, comfort, and a home by "his" wisdom in the use of it, so "you" may, after you are removed to another world, find friends, comfort, and a home - that is, may be happy in heaven. Jesus, here, does not say that we should do it "in the same way" that the steward did, for that was unjust; but only that we should "secure the result." This may be done by using our riches as we "should do;" that is, by not suffering them to entangle us in cares and perplexities dangerous to the soul, engrossing the time, and stealing away the affections; by employing them in works of mercy and benevolence, aiding the poor, contributing to the advance of the gospel, bestowing them where they will do good, and in such a manner that God will "approve" the deed, and will bless us for it. Commonly riches are a "hindrance" to piety. To many they are snares; and, instead of positively "benefiting" the possessor, they are an injury, as they engross the time and the affections, and do not contribute at all to the eternal welfare of the soul. Everything may, by a proper use, be made to contribute to our welfare in heaven. Health, wealth, talents, and influence may be so employed; and this is what our Saviour doubtless means here.<p>Of the mammon - "By means" of the mammon.<p>Mammon - A Syriac word meaning riches. It is used, also, as an idol the god of riches.<p>Of unrighteousness - These words are an Hebrew expression for "unrighteous mammon," the noun being used for an adjective, as is common in the New Testament. The word "unrighteous," here, stands opposed to "the true riches" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/16-11.htm">Luke 16:11</a>, and means "deceitful, false, not to be trusted." It has this meaning often. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-21.htm">Matthew 19:21</a>. It does not signify, therefore, that they had acquired the property "unjustly," but that property was "deceitful" and not to be trusted. The wealth of the steward was deceitful; he could not rely on its continuance; it was liable to be taken away at any moment. So the wealth of the world is deceitful. We cannot "calculate" on its continuance. It may give us support or comfort now, but it may be soon removed, or we taken from "it," and we should, therefore, so use it as to derive benefit from it hereafter.<p>When ye fail - When ye "are left," or when ye "die." The expression is derived from the parable as referring to the "discharge" of the steward; but it refers to "death," as if God then "discharged" his people, or took them from their stewardship and called them to account.<p>They may receive you - This is a form of expression denoting merely "that you may be received." The plural form is used because it was used in the corresponding place in the parable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-4.htm">Luke 16:4</a>. The direction is, so to use our worldly goods that "we may be received" into heaven when we die. "God" will receive us there, and we are to employ our property so that he will not cast us off for abusing it.<p>Everlasting habitations - Heaven, the eternal "home" of the righteous, where all our wants will be supplied, and where there can be no more anxiety, and no more removal from enjoyments, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. Make &#8230; friends of&#8212;Turn to your advantage; that is, as the steward did, "by showing mercy to the poor" (Da 4:27; compare Lu 12:33; 14:13, 14).<p>mammon of unrighteousness&#8212;treacherous, precarious. (See on [1678]Mt 6:24).<p>ye fail&#8212;in respect of life.<p>they may receive you&#8212;not generally, "ye may be received" (as Lu 6:38, "shall men give"), but "those ye have relieved may rise up as witnesses for you" at the great day. Then, like the steward, when turned out of one home shall ye secure another; but better than he, a heavenly for an earthly, an everlasting for a temporary habitation. Money is not here made the key to heaven, more than "the deeds done in the body" in general, according to which, as a test of character&#8212;but not by the merit of which&#8212;men are to be judged (2Co 5:10, and see Mt 25:34-40).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That by <span class="bld">mammon</span> here is meant riches is universally agreed, but whether it originally be a Chaldaic, or Syriac, or Punic word is not so well agreed. The Chaldee paraphrast useth it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-11.htm" title="Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.">Hosea 5:11</a></span>; but the Hebrew there is quite otherwise, (according to our translation), <span class="ital">he willingly walked after the commandment.</span> But if the notion of those be true, that some of those nations had an idol called Mammon, whom they made the god of riches, answering the Grecian Plutus, it fairly interprets the Chaldee paraphrast. They followed the command for idolatry, for such was Jeroboam’s commandment, mentioned in that text, and from thence it might be that the Syrians and Punics called riches mammon. We have the word in the New Testament four times, thrice in this chapter, once <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm" title="No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.">Matthew 6:24</a></span>. It is called <span class="ital">the mammon of unrighteousness, </span> by a Hebraism; it is as much as, the unrighteous mammon: by which we must not understand ill gotten goods, (for God hateth robbery for a burnt offering), we must restore such goods, not make friends of them; but riches are so called, because of the manifold temptations to sin which arise from them, upon which account they are also called <span class="ital">deceitful.</span> But others think that it is so called in opposition to <span class="ital">the true riches</span>, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-11.htm" title="If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?">Luke 16:11</a></span>. So that <span class="ital">the mammon of unrighteousness</span> is the mammon of falsehood, or hurtful riches, riches of hurtfulness (adicia sometimes signifies hurt or wrong, and adicein, <span class="ital">laedere, nocere</span>). Of these riches, which are no true riches, and which deceive the soul, and do hurt and mischief to a soul, exposing it to temptation, Christ commands us to <span class="bld">make friends; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. To make God our friend, not by meriting from him any thing by our disposal of them, but by obedience to his will in our distribution of them. Or: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. To make poor Christians our friends, so as we may have their prayers. So that, <span class="ital">when ye fail, </span> when you die, when you fail of any more comfort from them, <span class="bld">they may receive you into everlasting habitations; </span> the holy Trinity, or the blessed angels, (whose work it is, as we shall hear, to carry souls into Abraham’s bosom), may receive you into heaven. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I say unto you,.... These are the words of Christ, as are also the latter part of the preceding verse, accommodating and applying the parable to his disciples, and for their instruction: <p>make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness: by "mammon" are designed riches, wealth, and substance;  See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a> and is called "mammon of unrighteousness", because such wealth is often unrighteously detained, and is not made use of to right and good purposes, by the owners of it; or because, generally speaking, it is possessed by unrighteous men; and, for the most part, used in an unrighteous manner, in luxury, pride and intemperance, and is the root, instrument, and means of such unrighteousness: or it maybe rendered "mammon of hurt", or "hurtful mammon"; as it often is to those who are over anxious and desirous of it, or other disuse or misuse of it: or, as best of all, "mammon of falsehood", or "deceitful mammon"; so in the Targum (w), frequent mention is made of  , "mammon of falsity"; and stands opposed to "true riches" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a> for worldly riches are very empty and fallacious; wherefore deceitfulness is ascribed to them; and they are called uncertain riches, which are not to be depended upon.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a> unless it should be rather thought that it is so called, because gotten in an unrighteous way; as it was by Zacchaeus, and might be by Matthew, one of the disciples, Christ now speaks to, and the publicans and sinners, who were lately become his followers, and whom he advises, as the highest piece of wisdom and prudence, to dispose of in such a manner, as of it to "make" themselves "friends"; not God, Father, Son, and Spirit. These indeed are friends to the saints, but they are not made so by money; reconciliation and redemption are not procured this way; nor is the favour of the judge to be got by such means; the only means of reconciliation, are the blood and death of Christ; though indeed acts of beneficence, rightly performed, are well pleasing to God: nor are the angels meant, who are very friendly to all good men; nor rich men, to whom riches are not to be given, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16</a> but rather riches themselves, which, if not rightly used, and so made friends of, will cry, and be a witness against the owners of them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-1.htm">James 5:1</a> though it may be the poor saints are intended; who by their prayers are capable of doing either a great deal of hurt, or a great deal of good; and it is the interest of rich men to make them their friends: <p>that when ye fail: of money; or "that fails", as the Ethiopic version reads; or rather, when ye leave that, that is, when ye die; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-22.htm">Jeremiah 42:22</a> "know certainly that ye shall die"; the Septuagint renders it,  "ye shall fall by the sword", &amp;c. <p>they may receive you into everlasting habitations: the mansions of glory, which are many, and of an eternal duration: this is to be understood of their being received thither, not by the poor, to whom they have been benefactors; for though these may now pray for their reception to glory when they die, and will hereafter rejoice at their reception thither; yet they themselves will not be receivers of them, or their introducers into the everlasting tents, or tabernacles: nor are the angels intended, who carry the souls of the righteous into Abraham's bosom, and will gather the elect together at the last day; for not they, but God and Christ, receive the saints to glory: the words may be rendered impersonally, "you may be received"; in a way of welldoing, though not for it; mention is made of the "everlasting tabernacles", in <p>"Their glory also will I take unto me, and give these the everlasting tabernacles, which I had prepared for them.''

Dettinger and H. Bauer): opes <span class="ital">fallaces</span>, or <span class="ital">wealth which allures</span> (Löffler, Köster); that of Paulus (<span class="ital">Exeg. Handb</span>.): that Mammon is designated as unrighteous <span class="ital">towards the disciples</span>, to whom he has communicated little; that of Schulz and Olshausen: opes <span class="ital">impias</span> (Olshausen: “the bond by which every individual is linked to the <span class="greekheb">αἰὼν οὗτος</span> and its princes”); that of Heppe: that wealth is so designated as being no <span class="ital">true actual</span> possession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-11.htm" title="If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?">Luke 16:11</a>); and others. Moreover, a <span class="ital">hidden irony</span> (Eylau) against an Ebionitic error of the disciples, as if they had imputed to what is earthly in itself the character of <span class="greekheb">ἀδικία</span>, is remote from the words, since the predicate is taken from the conduct of the steward. There are analogous expressions of the Targumists, in which the characteristic peculiarity of Mammon is given by means of a superadded substantive (as <span class="greekheb">ממון דשקר</span>, <span class="greekheb">דרשע ממון</span>); see in Lightfoot, p. 844. The value of the predicate <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ἈΔΙΚ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, so far as the structure of the discourse is concerned, seems to be, that this application of wealth for selfish advantage is entirely conformable to the <span class="ital">improba indoles</span> thereof, according to which it allows itself to be used, instead of only for the purpose of serving the interest of its possessor (Mammon), for the selfish advantage of those who have it to administer. The epithet is <span class="ital">contemptuous</span>. Ye cannot, considering its nature, better make use of so worthless a thing! Bornemann, <span class="ital">Schol</span>. p. 98 ff., and in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1843, p. 116 ff., finds the whole precept <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΙΉΣΑΤΕ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> to be in contradiction with the moral teaching of Christ, and conjectures: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Οὐ ΠΟΙΉΣΕΤΕ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, “<span class="ital">non facietis</span> (nolite facere) <span class="ital">vobis amicos ex opibus injuste collectis</span>,” etc.,[196] without any trace in the evidence for the text. And the doubt of Bornemann is solved by the consideration that (1) Jesus does not bid the disciples <span class="ital">provide</span> themselves with Mammon in a similar way to the steward (the steward did not <span class="ital">provide himself</span> with wealth at all, rather he bestowed it on the debtors, but for his own advantage), but to apply the riches which they, as having hitherto been <span class="greekheb">οἰκονόμοι</span> of Mammon, still had at their disposal, in a similar way to that steward, to make themselves friends; (2) that Jesus requires of His disciples to forsake all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-27.htm" title="And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him, Follow me.">Luke 5:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-22.htm" title="Now when Jesus heard these things, he said to him, Yet lack you one thing: sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.">Luke 18:22</a> ff., comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-33.htm" title="Sell that you have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that fails not, where no thief approaches, neither moth corrupts.">Luke 12:33</a>) is the less in conflict with the passage before us, that at that time there were around Him so many publicans and sinners who had previously entered into His service (out of the service of Mammon), and for these the words of Jesus contained the command to forsake all just in the special form appropriate to the relations in which they stood. In respect of <span class="greekheb">μαθητάς</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-1.htm" title="And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods.">Luke 16:1</a>, we are not to conceive exclusively only of the Twelve, and of such as already <span class="ital">had</span> forsaken all; (3) our text does not conflict with the context (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm" title="No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.

The <span class="ital">Recepta</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐκλίπητε</span>[197] would mean: <span class="ital">when ye shall have died</span> (Plat. <span class="ital">Legg</span>. 6. p. 759 E, 9. p. 836 E; Xen. <span class="ital">Cyr</span>. 8:7. 26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-10.htm" title="And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.">Isaiah 11:10</a>, LXX; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm" title="Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.">Genesis 25:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-33.htm" title="And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered to his people.">Genesis 49:33</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/14-11.htm" title="Wherefore now, my son, consider what alms doeth, and how righteousness doth deliver.

But after <span class="ital">death</span> that which is first to be expected is not the kingdom of Messiah, or the life <span class="ital">in heaven</span> to which reference is usually made (even by Bleek), but the paradise in Sheol (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;">Luke 16:22</a>), to which, however, the predicate <span class="greekheb">αἰωνίους</span> is not appropriate (in opposition to Engelhardt). Moreover, Jesus could not refer His disciples to the condition after their <span class="ital">death</span>, since, according to the synoptic Gospels (and see also on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>), He had placed the <span class="ital">Parousia</span> and the setting up of the kingdom in the lifetime even of that generation[198] (<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/16.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ</span>: the use of the emphatic pronoun seems to involve that here begins the comment of Jesus on the parable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8</a> being spoken by the master and a part of the parable. But J. Weiss (in Meyer) views this verse as a second application put into the mouth of Jesus, but not spoken by Him, having for its author the compiler from whom Lk. borrowed (Feine’s <span class="ital">Vork. Lukas</span>). He finds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light....">Luke 16:8-13</a> three distinct applications, one by Jesus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8</a>; one by the compiler of precanonical Lk., <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a>; and one by Lk. himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/16-10.htm" title="He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much....">Luke 16:10-13</a>. This analysis is plausible, and tempting as superseding the difficult problem of finding a connection between these sentences, viewed as the utterance of one Speaker, the Author of the parable. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.">Luke 16:9</a> explicitly states what <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.">Luke 16:8</a> implies, that the prudence is to be shown in the way of making <span class="ital">friends</span>.—<span class="greekheb">φίλους</span>: the friends are not named, but the next parable throws light on that point. They are the <span class="ital">poor</span>, the Lazaruses whom Dives did <span class="ital">not</span> make friends of—to his loss. The counsel is to use wealth in doing kindness to the poor, and the implied doctrine that doing so will be to our eternal benefit. Both counsel and doctrine are held to apply even when wealth has been ill-gotten. Friends of value for the eternal world can be gained even by <span class="ital">the mammon of unrighteousness</span>. The more ill-gotten the more need to be redeemed by beneficent use; only care must be taken not to <span class="ital">continue</span> to get money by unrighteousness in order to have wherewith to do charitable deeds, a not uncommon form of counterfeit philanthropy, which will not count in the Kingdom of Heaven. The name for wealth here is very repulsive, seeming almost to imply that wealth <span class="ital">per se</span> is evil, though that Jesus did not teach.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκλίπῃ</span>, when it (wealth) fails, as it must at death. The other reading, <span class="greekheb">ἐκλίπητε</span> (T.R.), means “when ye die,” so used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm" title="Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.">Genesis 25:8</a>.—<span class="greekheb">αἰωνίους σκηνάς</span>, eternal tents, a poetic paradox = Paradise, the poor ye treated kindly there to welcome you! Believing it to be impossible that Jesus could give advice practically suggesting the doing of evil that good might come, Bornemann conjectures that an <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> has fallen out before <span class="greekheb">ποιήσετε</span> (fut.), giving as the real counsel: do <span class="ital">not</span> make, etc.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness</span>] The Greek may mean either <span class="ital">Make the unrighteous mammon your friend;</span> or <span class="ital">make yourselves friends by your use of the unrighteous mammon.</span> There is no proof that Mammon is the Hebrew equivalent to Plutus, the Greek god of wealth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm" title="No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.">Matthew 6:24</a>). Mammon simply means wealth and is called ‘unrighteous’ by metonymy (i.e. the ethical character of the use is represented as cleaving to the thing itself) because the abuse of riches is more common than their right use (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-10.htm" title="For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is not therefore necessary to give to the word ‘unrighteous’ the sense of ‘false’ or ‘unreal,’ though sometimes in the LXX. it has almost that meaning. We turn mammon into a friend, and make ourselves friends by its means, when we use riches not as our own to squander, but as God’s to employ in deeds of usefulness and mercy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when ye fail</span>] i.e. when ye die; but some good MSS. read “when <span class="ital">it </span>(mammon) fails,” which the true riches never do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-33.htm" title="Sell that you have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that fails not, where no thief approaches, neither moth corrupts.">Luke 12:33</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they may receive you</span>] The ‘<span class="ital">they</span>’ are either the poor who have been made friends by the right use of wealth; or the word is impersonal, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-11.htm" title="And when they bring you to the synagogues, and to magistrates, and powers, take you no thought how or what thing you shall answer, or what you shall say:">Luke 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-20.htm" title="But God said to him, You fool, this night your soul shall be required of you: then whose shall those things be, which you have provided?">Luke 12:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-31.htm" title="For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?">Luke 23:31</a>. The latter sense seems to be the best, for it is only by a very secondary and subordinate analogy that those whom we aid by a right use of riches can be said (‘by their prayers on earth, or their testimony in heaven’) to ‘receive’ us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">into everlasting habitations</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">into the eternal tents, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-2.htm" title="In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.

And benefits are laid out to the best account when bestowed on the sons and servants of GOD.—V. g.] If the friends had no part to play in this instance viz. in receiving their benefactors to everlasting habitations], what need would there be to make friends?—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑἸΩΝΊΟΥς</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">everlasting</span>) This is put in antithesis to the <span class="ital">failure</span> implied in <span class="greekheb">ὅταν ἐκλίπητε</span>.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΚΗΝᾺς</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">tabernacles</span>, or <span class="ital">habitations</span>) They are so called on account of their security, pleasantness, and the convenience of <span class="ital">dwelling together</span>, as it were, in one common mansion.

Then, with his usual solemn formula, "I say unto you," the Lord gave out his moral interpretation of the parable. His words were addressed to possessors of various degrees of wealth. "You will soon have to give up all your worldly goods; be prudent in time, make some real friends out of the mammon of unrighteousness; by means of that money entrusted to your care, do good to others who are in need." The <span class="accented">mammon of unrighteousness.</span> This word "mammon" does not denote, as some have supposed, the name of a deity, the god of wealth or money, but it signifies "money" itself. It is a Syriac or Aramaic term. The words, "of unrighteousness," are added because in so many cases <span class="accented">the getting</span> of money is tainted with unrighteousness in some form or other; and, when possessed, it so often hardens the heart, as the Lord himself said  in another place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-25.htm">Luke 18:25</a>), that it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. "What the steward of my story," said the Master, "did to men of <span class="accented">his</span> world, see that you with your money do toward those who belong to your world." <span class="cmt_word">That, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations</span>. So that when you shall be dismissed from being stewards of God's possessions, that is, when ye shall die, "when ye suffer the last eclipse and bankruptcy of life," that then others, your friends, may receive you (welcome you) into everlasting dwellings. The majority of the older authorities here, instead of" when ye fail," read, "when it (money) shall fail you" (by the event of your death). The sense of the passage, however, remains the same, whichever reading be adopted. But now a deeply interesting question arises - When the Lord speaks <span class="accented">of friends</span> receiving us after death into eternal homes, to what <span class="accented">friends</span> is he alluding? Great expositors, Ewald and Meyer, for instance, tell us that he means <span class="accented">the angels.</span> But the plain sense of the parable points, not to angels, but to poor, weak, suffering persons whom we have helped here; these, then, must be the friends who will receive us, or welcome us, in the world to come. A further query suggests itself - <span class="accented">How</span> will these be able to receive us? To such a question no definite reply can be given. We know too little of the awful mysteries of <span class="accented">that</span> world to be able even to hazard a surmise as to the help or the comfort which grateful, blessed spirits will be able to show to their brethren the newly arrived, when they receive them. His word here must suffice us; well will it be for us, if one day we practically discover the holy secret for ourselves. Godet has a weighty note with which he concludes his exposition of this difficult but most instructive parable: "There is no thought more fitted than that of this parable, on the one hand to undermine the idea of merit belonging to alms-giving (what merit could be got out of that which is another's? and is not all money, are not all goods out of which we bestow our alms, God's?); and on the other, to encourage us in the practice of that virtue which assures us of friends and protectors for the grave moment of our passing into the world to come." One beautiful and exquisitely comforting thought is shrined in this playful and yet intensely solemn utterance of Jesus. The eternal tents, the "many mansions," as John calls them, will have among their occupants, it is certain, many a one whose life on earth was hard and sorrowful. These are now enjoying bliss indescribable, these poor Lazaruses, to whom this world was so sad, so dreary a habitation. And perhaps a portion of their blessedness consists in this power, to which the Lord makes allusion here, of assisting others - the <span class="accented">helped here becoming the helpers there.</span> Although the teaching of Christ and his chosen servants here and elsewhere shows us distinctly that no <span class="accented">merit</span> can attach to almsgiving, seeing that our alms are only given out of property entrusted to us for a short time by God for this and other similar purposes, yet the same authoritative teaching informs us that God <span class="accented">has</span> regard to almsdeeds done in the true spirit of love, in determining our eternal destiny. Thus a message direct from heaven informs the Roman legionary Cornelius that his prayers and alms were come up for a memorial before God. Paul writes to Timothy to charge the Ephesus Christians "that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life." In the parable of Lazarus and Dives we shall find this principle yet more clearly illustrated. These are only a few out of the many passages where this generosity and almsgiving is commended to the believer with peculiar earnestness. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Make to yourselves friends<p>Compare Virgil, "Aeneid," vi., 664:.
