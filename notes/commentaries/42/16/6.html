These would include that which answered to the modern lease, the contract which specified the rent, and probably also the memorandum of the due delivery of the annual share of the produce. In this case the measure is the Hebrew <span class= "ital">bath,</span> which has been variously estimated, the data being uncertain and conflicting, at from one to three gallons to the higher number stated in the marginal note. The steward by thus tempting the debtors with an immediate gain, and making them sharers in his frauds, took the readiest and most direct means of securing at once their favour and their silence. That which answered to this in the first application of the parable was the conduct of the Pharisees, just in proportion as they lost the moral force which they had once exercised, in accommodating their casuistry to the selfishness of their followers. Thus by their Corban teaching (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-5.htm" title="But you say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatever you might be profited by me;">Matthew 15:5</a>) they released men from the obligation of supporting parents, and made perjury easy by their artificial distinctions as to oaths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:">Matthew 5:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!">Matthew 23:16-22</a>), gave a wide license to lust by their doctrine of divorce (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-31.htm" title="It has been said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce:">Matthew 5:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-3.htm" title="The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?">Matthew 19:3</a>), and substituted the paying tithes of mint, and anise, and cummin for the weightier matters of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-23.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.">Matthew 23:23</a>). Like phenomena have been seen in analogous circumstances in the history of the Christian Church. When Leo X. sent forth his preachers of indulgences with their short and easy methods of salvation; when Jesuit confessors were to be found in every court of Europe, doing nothing to preserve their votaries from a fathomless licentiousness; when Protestant theologians tuned their voice according to the time, and pandered to the passions of a Henry VIII. or a Landgrave of Hesse; when the preachers of justification by faith turned the grace of God into lasciviousness, or made it compatible with a life of money-making worldliness; when men lower the standard of duty to gain support and popularity—there the act of the steward in bidding the debtor write fifty measures, when he owed a hundred, finds its counterpart.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-12 Whatever we have, the property of it is God's; we have only the use of it, according to the direction of our great Lord, and for his honour. This steward wasted his lord's goods. And we are all liable to the same charge; we have not made due improvement of what God has trusted us with. The steward cannot deny it; he must make up his accounts, and be gone. This may teach us that death will come, and deprive us of the opportunities we now have. The steward will make friends of his lord's debtors or tenants, by striking off a considerable part of their debt to his lord. The lord referred to in this parable commended not the fraud, but the policy of the steward. In that respect alone is it so noticed. Worldly men, in the choice of their object, are foolish; but in their activity, and perseverance, they are often wiser than believers. The unjust steward is not set before us as an example in cheating his master, or to justify any dishonesty, but to point out the careful ways of worldly men. It would be well if the children of light would learn wisdom from the men of the world, and would as earnestly pursue their better object. The true riches signify spiritual blessings; and if a man spends upon himself, or hoards up what God has trusted to him, as to outward things, what evidence can he have, that he is an heir of God through Christ? The riches of this world are deceitful and uncertain. Let us be convinced that those are truly rich, and very rich, who are rich in faith, and rich toward God, rich in Christ, in the promises; let us then lay up our treasure in heaven, and expect our portion from thence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A hundred measures - The measure here mentioned is the "bath" which contained, according to Dr. Arbuthnot's tables, 7 12 gallons, or, according to the marginal note, about 9 gallons and 3quarts.<p>Oil - Oil of olives, or sweet oil. It was much used for lamps, as an article of food <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-2.htm">Exodus 29:2</a>, and also for anointing, and, of course, as an article of commerce, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>. These were persons, doubtless, who had "rented" land of the rich man, and who were to give him a certain proportion of the produce.<p>Thy bill - The contract, obligation, or "lease." It was probably written as a "promise" by the debtor and signed by the steward, and thus became binding. Thus he had power to alter it, without supposing that his master would detect it. The bill or contract was in the hands of the steward, and he gave it back to him to write a new one.<p>Quickly - He supposed that his master would soon remove him, and he was, therefore, in haste to have all things secure beforehand. It is worthy of remark, also, that "all" this was wrong. His master had called for the account: but, instead of rendering it, he engaged in other business, disobeyed his lord still, and, in contempt of his commands, sought his own interest. All sinners would be slow to give in their account to God if they could do it; and it is only because, when God calls them by death, they "cannot but go," that they do not engage still in their own business and disobey him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-7. fifty &#8230; fourscore&#8212;deducting a half from the debt of the one, and a fifth from that of the other.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-1.htm" title="And he said also to his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused to him that he had wasted his goods.">Luke 16:1</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said an hundred measures of oil,....
