As indicating the readiness of the people of Jerusalem to proceed to extremities of this kind, we may refer to their treatment of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm" title="Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the middle of them, and so passed by.">John 8:59</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-31.htm" title="Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.">John 10:31</a>) and Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/7-58.htm" title="And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.">Acts 7:58-59</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-8 Men often pretend to examine the evidences of revelation, and the truth of the gospel, when only seeking excuses for their own unbelief and disobedience. Christ answered these priests and scribes with a plain question about the baptism of John, which the common people could answer. They all knew it was from heaven, nothing in it had an earthly tendency. Those that bury the knowledge they have, are justly denied further knowledge. It was just with Christ to refuse to give account of his authority, to those who knew the baptism of John to be from heaven, yet would not believe in him, nor own their knowledge.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-23.htm">Matthew 21:23-27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The Ethiopic version adds, "whom we fear"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-26.htm">Matthew 21:26</a> for it seems that they had not so behaved as to have the good will and esteem of the people, at least they did not pin their faith on their sleeve: <p>for they be persuaded that John was a prophet; they were fully assured of it; and the sentiments and authority of the chief priests could have no weight and influence upon them to weaken their faith in this point; the evidence was so strong, and their faith so firm and sure. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/20.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-6.htm" title="But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.">Luke 20:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">καταλιθάσει</span>: in the parallels it is indicated generally that they feared the people; here it is explained why or what they feared: <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that the people would stone them; to be taken <span class="ital">cum grano</span>.
