The Persic version very wrongly renders it, "and lookest not upon the countenance, and heart of any one whomsoever"; for though Christ did not look upon the countenances of men, and judge according to the outward appearance, nor regard men on account of outward circumstances, as riches, honours, learning, &amp;c. yet he looked upon the heart, and knew what was in it, and respected sincerity and uprightness wherever he found it, and which were wanting in these men: <p>but teachest the way of God truly; the way of worshipping God, and of enjoying him, both in this world, and in that to come; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> person <i>of any</i>, but teachest the way of God truly:</span><p>(e) You are not moved by favour of any man: and by person he means outward circumstances, for if a man judges according to these, there will be those who are truly alike whom he will judge to be different.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/20.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-21.htm" title="And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:">Luke 20:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὀρθῶς</span>, rightly, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-43.htm" title="Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.

Matthew and Mark both tell us that in this plot the Herodians were united with the Pharisees (and Sanhedrin). The great Nazareth Reformer was equally hateful to both these hostile parties; hence their union in this matter. It was a well and skilfully laid question. This "tribute" was a capitation tax - a denarius a head assessed on the whole population, the publicans who farmed it being answerable for it to the Roman treasury. As a direct personal tax it was most unpopular, and was looked on by scrupulous legalists and the more zealous Jews as involving a greater humiliation than the ordinary import or export customs dues. It occasioned at times popular tumults, as in the case of Judas of Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>). If Jesus answered the question in the affirmative "Yes, it is lawful for the Jews to give this tribute to Caesar," then the Pharisees would use this decision of his as a means of undermining his credit with the zealous populace. "See, after all," they would say, "this pretended Messiah of yours is but a poor-hearted traitor. <span class="accented">Think of King Messiah paying tribute to a Gentile."</span> If, on the other hand, the Master had said such payment of tribute was unlawful, then the Herodians, who were watching him, hoping for some such expression of opinion, would at once have denounced him to their Roman friends as One who taught the people - only too ready to listen to such teaching - lessons of sedition. In the latter case Pilate and the officials of Rome would have taken good care that the Galilaean Master had troubled the Sanhedrin no more. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/20.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Acceptest not the person<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>. </body></html>
