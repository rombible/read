How many resemble the Jews who murdered the prophets and crucified Christ, in their enmity to God, and aversion to his service, desiring to live according to their lusts, without control! Let all who are favoured with God's word, look to it that they make proper use of their advantages. Awful will be the doom, both of those who reject the Son, and of those who profess to reverence Him, yet render not the fruits in due season. Though they could not but own that for such a sin, such a punishment was just, yet they could not bear to hear of it. It is the folly of sinners, that they persevere in sinful ways, though they dread the destruction at the end of those ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this parable explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-45</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. beat, &c.&#8212;(Mt 21:35); that is, the prophets, extraordinary messengers raised up from time to time.
