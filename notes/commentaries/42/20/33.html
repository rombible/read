But we wrong ourselves, and wrong the truth of Christ, when we form our notions of the world of spirits by this world of sense. There are more worlds than one; a present visible world, and a future unseen world; and let every one compare this world and that world, and give the preference in his thoughts and cares to that which deserves them. Believers shall obtain the resurrection from the dead, that is the blessed resurrection. What shall be the happy state of the inhabitants of that world, we cannot express or conceive,<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this explained in the <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-15.htm">Matthew 22:15-33</a> notes, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-13.htm">Mark 12:13-27</a> notes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-34. no resurrection&#8212;"nor angel nor spirit" (Ac 23:8); the materialists of the day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-27.htm" title="Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,">Luke 20:27</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore in the resurrection,....

The answer of Jesus is not only full of tolerant condescension, but also of a divine wisdom which at once dwarfs into insignificance the most vaunted insight of the Rabbinic Hillels and Shammais. It is further most important, as being one of the very few passages which give us a clear glimpse into the actual conditions of future blessedness. These Sadducees erred because, in their ignorance of the Scriptures and the power of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-24.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to them, Do you not therefore err, because you know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?">Mark 12:24</a>), they were imagining a kingdom which could be inherited by “flesh and blood.”</body></html>
