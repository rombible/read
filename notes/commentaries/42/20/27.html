Bornemann defends <span class="greekheb">οὔτε</span> by the supposition that it corresponds with the following <span class="greekheb">καί</span>. But in that case <span class="greekheb">ἰσάγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γάρ εἰσι</span> must be placed in a parenthesis, which, indeed, Lachmann does, although it is nowise notified, not even by the twofold <span class="greekheb">εἰσί</span>, whereby the two predicates are emphatically kept apart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[237] Who nevertheless assumes without proof (p. 102) that Adam’s body, before the creation of the woman, was <span class="ital">externally without sex</span>, and that this also is the case with the bodies of the risen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[238] 4Ma 16:25 : <span class="greekheb">αἱ διὰ τὸν Θεὸν ἀποθνήσκοντες ζῶσι τῷ Θεῷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὥσπερ Ἀβραὰμ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Ἰσαὰκ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ Ἰακὼβ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ πάντες οἱ πατριάρχαι</span>, is so far parallel as in that place <span class="greekheb">ζῶσι τῷ Θεῷ</span> is likewise said of the state of existence in relation to God in Paradise. Moreover, 4Ma 7:19 belongs to this subject, as being a passage in harmony with the text before us. Comp. Grimm thereupon, p. 332.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[239] The <span class="greekheb">ζῶσιν</span> subsists not merely in the <span class="ital">view</span> of God, who considers them in reference to their future resurrection as living, as J.

It is a case of a nominative in loose apposition with a genitive—“outside the construction of the sentence—interposed as a pendent word, so to speak,” Winer, G. N. T., p. 668.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ εἶναι</span>: literally denying that there is <span class="ital">not</span> a resurrection, the meaning being really the reverse. After verbs of denying the Greeks repeat the negation. The reading <span class="greekheb">λέγοντες</span>, though well attested, looks like a grammatical correction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27-40. </span>Discomfiture of the Sadducees.<span class="bld"><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>27</span>. <span class="ital">certain of the Sadducees</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm" title="But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?">Matthew 3:7</a>. On the Sadducees see the Excursus on Jewish Sects. They were undeterred by the discomfiture of the Pharisees and Herodians, and perhaps their plot had been so arranged as coincidently to humiliate our Lord, if they could, by a difficult question, and so to shake His credit with the people. Some have supposed that the memorable incident of the Woman taken in Adultery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-1.htm" title="Jesus went to the mount of Olives....">John 8:1-11</a>) also took place on this day; in which case there would have been three temptations of Christ, one <span class="ital">political</span>, one <span class="ital">doctrinal</span>, and one <span class="ital">speculative.</span> But that incident rose spontaneously, whereas these had been pre-arranged.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which deny that there is any resurrection</span>] Jos. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xviii. 1, § 4; <span class="ital">B.

They refused to see any proof of it in the Books of Moses; and to the Prophets and the other books (the <span class="ital">Ketubhim</span> or Hagiographa) they only attached a subordinate importance. Their question was inspired less by deadly hatred than by supercilious scorn. Wealthy and powerful, they only professed to despise Jesus, up to this time, as a ‘Prophet of Nazareth,’ though now they became His <span class="ital">main</span> murderers. They are not so much as mentioned by St John, and very slightly by St Mark and St Luke, nor did Christ utter against them the same denunciations as against the Pharisees, who were His daily opponents. All the leading families of high priests at this period were Sadducees, and—except where it comes into <span class="ital">direct collision</span> with religion—Epicurean worldliness is more tolerant than interested fanaticism.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/20.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div>[27. <span class="greekheb">Ἀντιλέγοντες</span>, <span class="ital">who deny</span>) The truth is the most ancient: error is a new and upstart contradiction raised against it; although from time to time those in error esteem their own opinion to be even the more ancient.—V. g.]<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-40.</span> - <span class="accented">The scornful question of the Sadducees bearing on the doctrine of the resurrection, and the Lord's reply.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27, 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came to him certain of the Saddducees, which deny that there is</span>  <span class="cmt_word">any resurrection; and they asked him, saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother</span>. This is the only occasion related in the Gospels where our Lord comes in direct conflict with the Sadducees. They were a small but very wealthy and powerful sect. The high priests at this period and their families seem to have belonged generally to this party. They acknowledged as Divine the books of Moses, but refused to see in them any proof of the resurrection, or indeed of life after death. To the prophets and the other books they only attached subordinate importance. Supercilious worldliness, and a quiet indifference to all spiritual things, characterized them at this period. They come, comparatively speaking, little in contact with Jesus during his earthly ministry. While the Pharisee hated the Galilaean Master, the Sadducee professed to look on him rather with contempt. The question here seems to have been put with supercilious scorn. SS. Matthew and Mark preface the Lord's answer with a few words of grave rebuke, exposing the questioners' utter ignorance of the deep things involved in their query. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/20.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Asked<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-18.htm">Mark 12:18</a>. </body></html>
