He did not give a direct answer, but reproved them for offering to impose upon him; and they could not fasten upon any thing wherewith to stir up either the governor or the people against him. The wisdom which is from above, will direct all who teach the way of God truly, to avoid the snares laid for them by wicked men; and will teach our duty to God, to our rulers, and to all men, so clearly, that opposers will have no evil to say of us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this explained in the <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-15.htm">Matthew 22:15-33</a> notes, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-13.htm">Mark 12:13-27</a> notes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. tribute&#8212;(See on [1710]Mt 17:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-21.htm" title="And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:">Luke 20:21</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no? The Syriac and Persic versions here, as in the other evangelists, render it, "head money". The phrase, "for us", is here added, and on it lies the emphasis, and stress of the question; for the doubt pretended, was not whether it was lawful for the Romans to pay tribute to Caesar, but whether it was lawful for them who were Jews, were Abraham's seed, and, as they boasted, were never in bondage, but were the Lord's free people, to pay tribute to an Heathen emperor, or no. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/20.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-22.htm" title="Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no?">Luke 20:22</a> f. <span class="ital">The question</span>.—<span class="greekheb">φόρον</span> = <span class="greekheb">κῆνσον</span>, a Latinism, in the parallels.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Cesar</span>, <span class="ital">or no?</span>] The question was devised with so superlative a craft that it seemed impossible for our Lord to escape.
