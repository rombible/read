How many resemble the Jews who murdered the prophets and crucified Christ, in their enmity to God, and aversion to his service, desiring to live according to their lusts, without control! Let all who are favoured with God's word, look to it that they make proper use of their advantages. Awful will be the doom, both of those who reject the Son, and of those who profess to reverence Him, yet render not the fruits in due season. Though they could not but own that for such a sin, such a punishment was just, yet they could not bear to hear of it. It is the folly of sinners, that they persevere in sinful ways, though they dread the destruction at the end of those ways.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this parable explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-45</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-19. written&#8212;(in Ps 118:22, 23. See on [1709]Lu 19:38). The Kingdom of God is here a Temple, in the erection of which a certain stone, rejected as unsuitable by the spiritual builders, is, by the great Lord of the House, made the keystone of the whole. On that Stone the builders were now "falling" and being "broken" (Isa 8:15), "sustaining great spiritual hurt; but soon that Stone should fall upon them and grind them to powder" (Da 2:34, 35; Zec 12:3)&#8212;in their corporate capacity in the tremendous destruction of Jerusalem, but personally, as unbelievers, in a more awful sense still.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-9.htm" title="Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to farmers, and went into a far country for a long time.">Luke 20:9</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he beheld them,....

Yet the oracle does not directly indicate the fate of the builders, but rather the unexpected turn in the fortunes of the rejected and despised Stone. In Mt. and Mk. the citation is introduced, without any binding connection with what immediately goes before, to state a fact concerning the future of the “Son” lying outside the parable.

The stone is regarded both as a foundation-stone, and a stone at the angle of the building, binding the two walls together. These words made a deep impression on St Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-7.htm" title="To you therefore which believe he is precious: but to them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,...">1 Peter 2:7-8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/20.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-17.htm" title="And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?">Luke 20:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐμβλέψας</span>, <span class="ital">having looked stedfastly upon</span> them) in order to whet (stimulate) the attention of their minds respecting their own selves.

Quoting a well-known psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>), and using the imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14, 15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, he describes his fortunes under the imago of a corner-stone - that stone which forms the junction between the two most prominent walls of a building, and which is always laid with peculiar care and attention. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a> of our Gospel Simeon refers to the same well-known prophetic saying. The husbandmen who had just been described as vine-dressers are now described as builders, and the murdered son is reproduced under the image of a corner, stone tossed aside as useless. In the first part of the picture, the earthly humiliation of Messiah is portrayed when the stone is laid in the earth. In the second, the stone falling from the top of the building represents the crushing of all earthly opposition by Messiah in his glory.
