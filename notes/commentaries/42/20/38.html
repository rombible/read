They are of value as developing the meaning of those that precede them. All life, in the truest, highest sense of that term, depends upon our relation to God. We live to Him, and in Him. And so when He reveals Himself as the God of those who have passed from earth, He witnesses that that relation continues still. They are not dead, but are still living unto Him. We may, perhaps, connect the thought thus expressed with St. Paul’s words, “in Him we live, and move, and have our being,” in his speech at Athens. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:27-38 It is common for those who design to undermine any truth of God, to load it with difficulties. But we wrong ourselves, and wrong the truth of Christ, when we form our notions of the world of spirits by this world of sense. There are more worlds than one; a present visible world, and a future unseen world; and let every one compare this world and that world, and give the preference in his thoughts and cares to that which deserves them. Believers shall obtain the resurrection from the dead, that is the blessed resurrection.

But the "all" here meant "those who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world." These sustain a gracious covenant relation to God, which cannot be dissolved. In this sense our Lord affirms that for Moses to call the Lord the "God" of His patriarchal servants if at that moment they had no existence, would be unworthy of Him. He "would be ashamed to be called their God, if He had not prepared for them a city" (Heb 11:16).

The Persic version, reads, "all these live unto him"; namely, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for though they are dead to men, they are not to God; their souls live with him, and their bodies will be raised by him: he reckons of them, as if they were now alive, for he quickens the dead, and calls things that are not, as though they were; and this is the case of all the saints that are dead, as well as of those patriarchs. The Ethiopic reads, "all live with him"; as the souls of all departed saints do; the Arabic version reads, all live in him; so all do now, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> live unto him.</span><p>(i) That is, before him: a saying to take note of, for the godly do not die, though they die here on earth.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/20.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-38.htm" title="For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.">Luke 20:38</a>. <span class="greekheb">θεὸς</span> is predicate = Jehovah is not God of dead men.—<span class="greekheb">δὲ</span> has the force of the argumentative <span class="ital">nonne</span>.—<span class="greekheb">πάντες γὰρ αὐτῷ ζῶσιν</span>. “for all live unto Him” (A.V[167], R.V[168]), is probably an editorial explanatory gloss to make the deep thought of Jesus clearer (not in parallels). The gloss itself needs explanation. Is “all” to be taken without qualification?—<span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span> may be variously rendered “by Him,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, by His power: <span class="ital">quoad Dei potentiam</span> (Grotius), “in Him” (Ewald), “for Him,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, for His honour (Schanz), or for “His thought or judgment” = He accounts them as living (Hahn).

The Pharisees had endeavoured to draw proofs of immortality from the Law, i.e. from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-31.htm" title="Because he has despised the word of the LORD, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.">Numbers 15:31</a>. In later times they borrowed this proof from Christ,—lighting their torches at the sun though they hated its beams. But they had, up to this time, offered no proof so deep and true as this. The argument is that God would never have called Himself “the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,” if these Patriarchs, after brief and sad lives, had become mere heaps of crumbling dust. Would He have given confidence by calling Himself the God of dust and ashes? So Josephus (?) says, 4Ma 16:24, “they who die for God’s sake, live unto God as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the Patriarchs.” <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for all live unto him</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/14-8.htm" title="For whether we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's....">Romans 14:8-9</a>.

Moreover, they so live to God, as to enjoy God.
