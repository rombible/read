Pilate declares Jesus innocent, and has a mind to release him; yet, to please the people, he would punish him as an evil-doer. If no fault be found in him, why chastise him? Pilate yielded at length; he had not courage to go against so strong a stream. He delivered Jesus to their will, to be crucified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-20.htm">Matthew 27:20-23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 23:13-38.

In this final appeal, Pilate states most distinctly his opinion that Jesus is innocent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[196] Authorised Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22.</span> <span class="ital">the third time</span>] We can only obtain from all the four Evangelists, and especially from St John, a full conception of the earnestness with which Pilate strove to escape from the necessity of what he felt to be a needless crime. If he was not, as Tertullian says, “<span class="ital">jam pro conscientiasua Christianas” </span>he was evidently deeply impressed; and the impossibility of doing right must have come upon him as a terrible Nemesis for his past sins. It is very noteworthy that he took step after step to secure the acquittal of Jesus. 1. He emphatically and publicly announced His perfect innocence. <span class="ital">2.</span> He sent Him to Herod. 3. He made an offer to release Him as a boon. 4. He tried to make scourging take the place of crucifixion. 5. He appealed to compassion. St John shews still more clearly how in successive stages of the trial he sets aside, i. the vague general charge of being “an evil doer” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-30.htm" title="Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.">Luke 18:30</a>); ii. of being in any seditious sense “a king” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-39.htm" title="And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, You son of David, have mercy on me.">Luke 18:39</a>); iii. of any guilt in His religious claims (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-12.htm" title="He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.">Luke 19:12</a><span class="ital">).</span> He only yields at last through fear (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-12.htm" title="He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.">Luke 19:12</a>), which makes him release a man guilty of <span class="ital">the very crime</span> for which he delivers Jesus to a slave’s death. The fact that Pilate’s patron Sejanus had probably by this time fallen, and that Tiberius was executing all connected with him, may have enhanced Pilate’s fears. He knew that an accusation of High Treason (under the <span class="ital">Lex Majestatis)</span> was generally fatal (Tac. <span class="ital">Ann.</span> iii. 38. Suet. <span class="ital">Tib.</span> 58). All this, with other phases of these last scenes, will be found fully brought out in my <span class="ital">Life of Christ</span>, II. pp. 360-391.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/23.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div>[22. <span class="greekheb">Οὗτος</span>, <span class="ital">this man</span>) By this expression Jesus is put in contradistinction to Barabbas the robber.—V. g.]<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/23.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Said (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Dropping the speech-making tone, and simply asking a question. </body></html>
