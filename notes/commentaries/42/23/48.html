We must remember that the condemnation of the Christ was no spontaneous deed of the multitude. Their miserable share in the act was suggested to them by their rulers. In the multitude very quickly revulsion of feeling sets in, and they often regret the past with a bitter, useless regret. The wave of sorrow which seems to have swept across those wavering, unstable hearts, which induced them to smite their breasts in idle regret, was a dim and shadowy rehearsal of the mighty sorrow and true penitence which will one day, as their prophet told them, be the blessed lot of the once-loved people when "they shall look upon <span class="accented">me</span> whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only son" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). </body></html>
