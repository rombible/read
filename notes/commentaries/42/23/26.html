Though many reproached and reviled him, yet some pitied him. But the death of Christ was his victory and triumph over his enemies: it was our deliverance, the purchase of eternal life for us. Therefore weep not for him, but let us weep for our own sins, and the sins of our children, which caused his death; and weep for fear of the miseries we shall bring upon ourselves, if we slight his love, and reject his grace. If God delivered him up to such sufferings as these, because he was made a sacrifice for sin, what will he do with sinners themselves, who make themselves a dry tree, a corrupt and wicked generation, and good for nothing! The bitter sufferings of our Lord Jesus should make us stand in awe of the justice of God. The best saints, compared with Christ, are dry trees; if he suffer, why may not they expect to suffer? And what then shall the damnation of sinners be!

See Excursus V. The Apocryphal ‘Acts of Pilate’ says that the soldiers met Simon at the city gate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-17.htm" title="And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:">John 19:17</a>). There is no historical authority for the identification of the <span class="ital">Via Dolorosa</span> or for the ‘Stations’ of the <span class="ital">Via Crucis.</span> The latter are said to have originated among the Franciscans.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">on him they laid the cross</span>] Probably because our Lord, enfeebled by the terrible scourging and by the long hours of sleepless agitation, was too feeble to bear it. This seems to be specially implied by <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-21.htm" title="And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.">Mark 15:21</a>. It is not certain whether they made Simon carry the entire cross or merely part of the burden. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-6.htm" title="And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together.">Genesis 22:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>.) The Cross was not carried in the manner with which pictures have made us familiar, but either in two separate pieces—the body of the cross (<span class="ital">staticulum</span>) and its transom (<span class="ital">antenna</span>); or by tying these two pieces together in the shape of a V (<span class="ital">furca).</span> The Cross was certainly not the <span class="ital">crux decussata</span> (X) or St Andrew’s Cross; nor the <span class="ital">crux commissa </span>(T St Anthony’s Cross); but the ordinary Roman Cross (<span class="ital">crux immissa.</span> See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-37.htm" title="And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.">Matthew 27:37</a>). The Hebrew word for Cross is the letter Thau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the middle thereof.">Ezekiel 9:4</a>), which gave abundant opportunities for the allegorising tendency of the Fathers. On the body of the Cross was certainly a projecting piece of wood <span class="ital">(</span><span class="greekheb">πῆγμα</span><span class="ital">, sedile)</span> to support the sufferer, but there was no <span class="ital">suppedaneum</span> or rest for the feet; and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-39.htm" title="Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.">Luke 24:39</a> it seems certain that one nail (if not two) was driven through the feet. Nothing could exceed the agony caused by this “most cruel and horrible punishment” as even the ancients unanimously call it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that he might bear it after Jesus</span>] Hence various Gnostic sects (e.g. the Basilidians) devised the fable that Simon was executed by mistake for Jesus, a fable which, through Apocryphal legends, has found its way into the Koran (Koran, Suras 3, 4). St Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-32.htm" title="And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.">Matthew 27:32</a>) and St Mark use the technical word <span class="greekheb">ἠγγάρευσαν</span><span class="ital">,</span> ‘impressed for service.’ Perhaps the Jews had received a hint that Simon was a disciple.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-32.</span> - <span class="accented">On</span> <span class="accented">the way to Calvary.

Plutarch tells us that every criminal condemned to crucifixion carried his own cross. There was borne in front of him, or else hung round his own neck, a white tablet, on which the crime for which he suffered was inscribed. Possibly this was what was afterwards affixed to the cross itself. <span class="cmt_word">Simon, a Cyrenian</span>. Cyrene was an important city in North Africa, with a large colony of resident Jews. These Cyrenian Jews had a synagogue of their own in Jerusalem. It is probable that Simon was a Passover pilgrim. St. Mark tells us he was the father of "Alexander and Rufus;" evidently, from his mention of them, these were notable persons in the early Christian Church. Very likely their connection with the followers of Jesus dated from this incident on the road to Calvary. <span class="cmt_word">Coming out of the country.</span> He was probably one of the pilgrims lodged in a village near Jerusalem, and met the sad procession as he was entering the city on his way to the temple. <span class="cmt_word">On him they laid the cross.</span> Our Lord was weakened by the trouble and agitation of the past sleepless night, and was, of course, faint and utterly exhausted from the effects of the terrible scourging. The cross used for this mode of execution was (1)either the <span class="accented">Cruz decussata <span class="cmt_word"></span>X</span>, what is usually known as St. Andrew's cross; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">Cruz commissa</span> <span class="cmt_word">T</span>, St. Anthony's cross; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the ordinary Roman cross <span class="cmt_word">&dagger;</span>, <span class="accented">Cruz immissa.</span> Our Lord suffered on the third description, the Roman cross. This consisted of two pieces, the one perpendicular (<span class="accented">staticulum</span>), the other horizontal (<span class="accented">antenna</span>). About the middle of the first was fastened a piece of wood (<span class="accented">sedile</span>), on which the condemned rested. This was necessary, else, during the long torture, the weight of the body would have torn the hands, and the  body would have fallen. The cross was not very high, scarcely twice the height of an ordinary man. Strong nails were driven through the hands and feet. The victim usually lived about twelve hours, sometimes much longer. The agonies endured by the crucified have been thus summarized: "The fever which soon set in produced a burning thirst. The increasing inflammation of the wounds in the back, hands, and feet; the congestion of the blood in the head, lungs, and heart; the swelling of every vein, an indescribable oppression, racking pains in the head; the stiffness of the limbs, caused by the unnatural position of the body; - these all united to make the punishment, in the language of Cicero ('In Verr.,' 5:64), <span class="accented">crudelissimum teterrimumque supplicium.</span> From the beginning Jesus had foreseen that such would be the end of his life." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/23.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Laid hold on (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>Compare the peculiar word used by Matthew and Mark.
