The poorest beggar that asked a miracle for the relief of his necessity, was never denied; but this proud prince, who asked for a miracle only to gratify his curiosity, is refused. He might have seen Christ and his wondrous works in Galilee, and would not, therefore it is justly said, Now he would see them, and shall not. Herod sent Christ again to Pilate: the friendships of wicked men are often formed by union in wickedness. They agree in little, except in enmity to God, and contempt of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Made friends together ... - What had been the cause of their quarrel is unknown. It is commonly supposed that it was Pilate's slaying the Galileans in Jerusalem, as related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-1.htm">Luke 13:1-2</a>. The occasion of their reconciliation seems to have been the civility and respect which Pilate showed to Herod in this case. It was not because they were united in "hating" Jesus, as is often the case with wicked people, for Pilate was certainly desirous of releasing him, and "both" considered him merely as an object of ridicule and sport. It is true, however, that wicked people, at variance in other things, are often united in opposing and ridiculing Christ and his followers; and that enmities of long standing are sometimes made up, and the most opposite characters brought together, simply to oppose religion.

For it pleased Herod, that Pilate should show such a regard to his authority and power, as to send one that belonged to his jurisdiction to take cognizance of his case; and especially as it was a person that was much talked of, and he had long wanted to see; and Pilate, on the other hand, was pleased with Herod, that though he was one that was under his jurisdiction, and so had a right of trying the cause, and either absolve or condemn, yet chose not to use this his power, but referred the case to the Roman governor: <p>for before they were at enmity between themselves; it may be on account of the Galilaeans, the subjects of Herod, whom Pilate had slain, whilst they were sacrificing at Jerusalem, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/13-1.htm">Luke 13:1</a>, which Herod might resent, as an infringement upon his authority and power; for had they been ever so deserving of punishment, it ought to have been left to him, to have inflicted it, and not the governor of Judea, who had nothing to do with them: but now matters were made up by this step of Pilate's, in sending Christ to him, supposed to be a Galilean, and so of Herod's jurisdiction; which was tacitly acknowledging his former conduct to be wrong, and showed a regard to Herod's authority: and thus they were reconciled together, and agreed in their contemptuous usage, and ill-treatment of Christ, and so fulfilled <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</span><p>(3) The hatred of godliness binds the wicked together.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/23.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-12.htm" title="And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.">Luke 23:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγένοντο φίλοι</span>: that the one positive result of the transaction—two rulers, previously on bad terms, reconciled, at least for the time.
