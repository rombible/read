They triumph over him as if they had conquered him, at the time that he was conquering sin and death for them! They challenge him to save himself from the cross, when he was saving others by the cross! See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/27-39.htm" title="And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,...">Matthew 27:39-44</a>. <span class="ital">Let him save himself if he be Christ, the chosen of God </span>— If he really be the true Messiah, <span class="ital">the elect of God, </span>and, in consequence of that divine choice, be the king of Israel, as he has often pretended, let him save himself from death, that we may see a demonstration of his saving power; and we will then believe him. Or, if he, as the Messiah, would deliver our nation from the Romans, (to do which they supposed would be the principal office of the Messiah,) let him deliver himself from the Romans that have him now in their hands. Thus these Jewish rulers ridiculed him, as captivated by the Romans instead of subduing them. The expression, <span class="greekheb">ο του θεου εκλεκτος</span>, <span class="ital">the elect, </span>or <span class="ital">chosen of God, </span>is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>, and appears to be one of those titles by which the Messiah was at that time distinguished. <span class="ital">The soldiers also </span>— Who kept guard at that time, joined with the rest of the spectators; and <span class="ital">mocked him, coming and offering him vinegar </span>— To drink in the midst of his agonies. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-29.htm" title="Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth.">John 19:29</a>. <span class="ital">And saying </span>— As the rulers and people had done; <span class="ital">if thou be the king of the Jews </span>— As thou hast frequently pretended to be, before thou undertakest to deliver them, <span class="ital">save thyself </span>— From our power, and thus begin to assert thy claim to a supreme authority. Their insult, it seems, did not lie in their offering our Lord vinegar, for that was the soldiers’ common drink, when mixed with water; (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-48.htm" title="And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.">Matthew 27:48</a>;) but it lay in what they said to him when they offered it, reproaching him for pretending to be a king, when he was so poor and mean a person, and now about to expire as a malefactor. As this claim of being a <span class="ital">king, </span>seemed to the soldiers most derogatory to the Roman authority, it is no wonder that they grounded their insult on this, rather than his professing himself the Son of God. Thus the priests derided his claiming the title of the Messiah, and the Romans his claiming that of a king.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:32-43 As soon as Christ was fastened to the cross, he prayed for those who crucified him. The great thing he died to purchase and procure for us, is the forgiveness of sin. This he prays for. Jesus was crucified between two thieves; in them were shown the different effects the cross of Christ would have upon the children of men in the preaching the gospel. One malefactor was hardened to the last. No troubles of themselves will change a wicked heart. The other was softened at the last: he was snatched as a brand out of the burning, and made a monument of Divine mercy. This gives no encouragement to any to put off repentance to their death-beds, or to hope that they shall then find mercy. It is certain that true repentance is never too late; but it is as certain that late repentance is seldom true. None can be sure they shall have time to repent at death, but every man may be sure he cannot have the advantages this penitent thief had. We shall see the case to be singular, if we observe the uncommon effects of God's grace upon this man. He reproved the other for railing on Christ. He owned that he deserved what was done to him. He believed Jesus to have suffered wrongfully. Observe his faith in this prayer. Christ was in the depth of disgrace, suffering as a deceiver, and not delivered by his Father. He made this profession before the wonders were displayed which put honour on Christ's sufferings, and startled the centurion. He believed in a life to come, and desired to be happy in that life; not like the other thief, to be only saved from the cross. Observe his humility in this prayer. All his request is, Lord, remember me; quite referring it to Jesus in what way to remember him. Thus he was humbled in true repentance, and he brought forth all the fruits for repentance his circumstances would admit. Christ upon the cross, is gracious like Christ upon the throne. Though he was in the greatest struggle and agony, yet he had pity for a poor penitent. By this act of grace we are to understand that Jesus Christ died to open the kingdom of heaven to all penitent, obedient believers. It is a single instance in Scripture; it should teach us to despair of none, and that none should despair of themselves; but lest it should be abused, it is contrasted with the awful state of the other thief, who died hardened in unbelief, though a crucified Saviour was so near him. Be sure that in general men die as they live.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-41.htm">Matthew 27:41-44</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Lu 23:32-38, 44-46.

The phrase, "with them", is wanting in the Oriental versions, and in one of Beza's copies: saying, <p>he saved others; by healing their diseases, or raising them from the dead: <p>let him save himself; from death, by unnailing himself, and coming down from the cross; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-42.htm">Matthew 27:42</a>. <p>if he be Christ; the Messiah, he and his followers give out he is; even the chosen of God, referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>.

What memories must have surged up in the hearts of many of the gazers - memories of his parables, his mighty miracles, his words of love; memories of the raising of Lazarus, and of the day of palms! Such a silent awe-struck contemplation was dangerous, the rulers felt, so they hastened to commence their mockery - "to clear," as Stier remarks, "the stifling air, and deafen the voice which was stirring even in themselves." "Look now," they would cry, "at the end of the Man who said he could do, and pretended to do, such strange, unheard-of things!" They seem soon to have induced many to join in their mocking cries and gestures, and so to break the awful silence. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/23.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Beholding<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-18.htm">Luke 10:18</a>.<p>Scoffed<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-14.htm">Luke 16:14</a>.<p>If he<p>The A.
