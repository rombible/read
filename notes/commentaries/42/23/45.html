He was willing to offer himself. Let us seek to glorify God by true repentance and conversion; by protesting against those who crucify the Saviour; by a sober, righteous, and godly life; and by employing our talents in the service of Him who died for us and rose again.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45-50</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>43. Jesus said, &c.&#8212;The dying Redeemer speaks as if He Himself viewed it in this light. It was a "song in the night." It ministered cheer to His spirit in the midnight gloom that now enwrapt it.<p>Verily I say unto thee&#8212;"Since thou speakest as to the king, with kingly authority speak I to thee."<p>To-day&#8212;"Thou art prepared for a long delay before I come into My kingdom, but not a day's delay shall there be for thee; thou shalt not be parted from Me even for a moment, but together we shall go, and with Me, ere this day expire, shalt thou be in Paradise" (future bliss, 2Co 12:4; Re 2:7). Learn (1) How "One is taken and another left"; (2) How easily divine teaching can raise the rudest and worst above the best instructed and most devoted servants of Christ; (3) How presumption and despair on a death hour are equally discountenanced here, the one in the impenitent thief, the other in his penitent fellow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.

The Persic version renders it, "the gate of the temple"; and so the Syriac version, "the face of the gate of the temple"; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{14}</span> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</span><p>(14) Christ enters bravely and resolutely into the very darkness of death, and he does this so that he might overcome death even within its most secret places.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/23.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-45.htm" title="And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the middle.">Luke 23:45</a>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλιπόντος</span>: this phrase (a well-attested reading as against the T.R. <span class="greekheb">ἐσκοτίσθη ὁ ἥ</span>.) ought to mean the sun being eclipsed, an impossibility when the moon is full.

That it could not have been due to an eclipse is certain, for the Paschal moon was at the full.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the vail of the temple was rent in the midst</span>] The veil intended must be what was called the <span class="ital">Parocheth</span>, or <span class="ital">inner veil</span>, which hung between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. It was very heavy, and splendid with embroidery. It is alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-19.htm" title="Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil;">Hebrews 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-3.htm" title="And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;">Hebrews 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-19.htm" title="Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,...">Hebrews 10:19-20</a>. The obvious significance of the portent was the departure of the Shechinah or Presence of God from His now-deserted Temple. This particular event is (naturally) not mentioned by the Jews, but we may have a reference to it in the various omens of coming wrath which they say occurred “forty years” before the destruction of the Temple, and in which Jochanan Ben Zakkai saw the fulfilment of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-1.htm" title="Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars.">Zechariah 11:1</a>. For a fuller account of these events see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/27-51.htm" title="And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;...">Matthew 27:51-53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-33.htm" title="And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.">Mark 15:33</a>.

This was the inner veil, which hung between the holy place and the holy of holies. It was rich with costly embroidery, and very heavy. Before the willing surrender of life told of in the next versa (46), our Lord spoke twice more. These fifth and sixth words from the cross are preserved by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28, 30</a>). The first of these, "I <span class="accented">thirst</span> " - an expression of bodily exhaustion, of physical suffering - was predicted as part of the agony of the Servant of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>). The second, "It <span class="accented">is finished</span>!" tells that "the earthly life had been carried to its issue. That every essential point in the prophetic portraiture of Messiah had been realized. The last suffering for sin had been endured. The end of all had been gained. Nothing was left undone or unborne" (Westcott). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/23.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Veil<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>. </body></html>
