Most omit it altogether. One, followed by some of the versions, has it after <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-19.htm" title="(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)">Luke 23:19</a>. It would seem probable from these facts that the narrative was originally written without it, that it was then felt that the release of Barabbas required an explanation, and that a note was first added in the margin, either by a transcriber or by the writer himself in a duplicate copy, and then found its way into the text. The precise form of the phrase, to “have a necessity,” is not found in the other Gospels, but is common to St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-18.htm" title="If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because you say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.">Luke 11:18</a> and here), and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-37.htm" title="Nevertheless he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.">1Corinthians 7:37</a>). It is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-27.htm" title="Who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.">Hebrews 7:27</a>; Jude <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-3.htm" title="And Pilate asked him, saying, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, You say it.">Luke 23:3</a>. On the practice thus described, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-15.htm" title="Now at that feast the governor was wont to release to the people a prisoner, whom they would.">Matthew 27:15</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:13-25 The fear of man brings many into this snare, that they will do an unjust thing, against their consciences, rather than get into trouble. Pilate declares Jesus innocent, and has a mind to release him; yet, to please the people, he would punish him as an evil-doer. If no fault be found in him, why chastise him? Pilate yielded at length; he had not courage to go against so strong a stream.

We know it failed, and a condemned robber called Barabbas was preferred by the people. The more ancient authorities omit this verse (17). It probably was introduced at an early period into many manuscripts of St. Luke as a marginal. gloss, as an explanatory statement based on the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-15.htm">Matthew 27:15</a> or of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-6.htm">Mark 15:6</a>. As a Hebrew custom, it is never mentioned save in this place. Such a release was a common incident of a Latin Lectisternium, or feast in honour of the gods. The Greeks had a similar custom at the Thesmophoria. It was probably introduced at Jerusalem by the Roman power. </body></html>
