It is, perhaps, matter for regret that any other formula, such as the <span class= "ital">Absolvo te,</span> which dates, be it remembered, from the thirteenth century, has ever been substituted for them. They did not for the first time convey forgiveness. That had been, as the context indicates, sealed and assured before by an unspoken absolution. But they came as words of power from the great Absolver, to banish every lingering doubt or fear, to confirm every faint and trembling hope that had been kindled in the heart of the penitent. He knew the secrets of her soul, and could therefore affirm in the fulness of His knowledge that she fulfilled the conditions of forgiveness. Others, it is clear, can only so affirm in proportion as their insight approximates to His.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:36-50 None can truly perceive how precious Christ is, and the glory of the gospel, except the broken-hearted. But while they feel they cannot enough express self-abhorrence on account of sin, and admiration of his mercy, the self-sufficient will be disgusted, because the gospel encourages such repenting sinners. The Pharisee, instead of rejoicing in the tokens of the woman's repentance, confined his thoughts to her former bad character. But without free forgiveness none of us can escape the wrath to come; this our gracious Saviour has purchased with his blood, that he may freely bestow it on every one that believes in him. Christ, by a parable, forced Simon to acknowledge that the greater sinner this woman had been, the greater love she ought to show to Him when her sins were pardoned. Learn here, that sin is a debt; and all are sinners, are debtors to Almighty God. Some sinners are greater debtors; but whether our debt be more or less, it is more than we are able to pay. God is ready to forgive; and his Son having purchased pardon for those who believe in him, his gospel promises it to them, and his Spirit seals it to repenting sinners, and gives them the comfort. Let us keep far from the proud spirit of the Pharisee, simply depending upon and rejoicing in Christ alone, and so be prepared to obey him more zealously, and more strongly to recommend him unto all around us. The more we express our sorrow for sin, and our love to Christ, the clearer evidence we have of the forgiveness of our sins. What a wonderful change does grace make upon a sinner's heart and life, as well as upon his state before God, by the full remission of all his sins through faith in the Lord Jesus!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy sins are forgiven - What a gracious assurance to the weeping, loving penitent! How that voice, spoken to the troubled sinner, stills his anguish, allays his troubled feelings, and produces peace to the soul! And how manifest is it that he that could say thus "must" be God! No man has a "right" to forgive sin. No man "can" speak peace to the soul, and give assurance that its transgressions are pardoned: Here, then, Jesus gave indubitable proof that he was God as well as man; that he was Lord of the conscience as well as the pitying friend; and that he was as able to read the heart and give peace there, as he was to witness the external expression of sorrow for sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>48. said unto her, &c.&#8212;an unsought assurance, usually springing up unexpected in the midst of active duty and warm affections, while often it flies from those who mope and are paralyzed for want of it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-40.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to you.

Directing his discourse to the woman that now stood before him: <p>thy sins are forgiven; which was said, partly on account of the Pharisee, to let him see, that he knew this woman, what she was, and had been; that she had been a sinner, a great sinner, one that owed five hundred pence, but was now forgiven, washed, cleansed, sanctified, and justified, and therefore not to be shunned and avoided; and partly on the woman's account, that she might have a fresh discovery of the forgiveness of her sins, for her comfort under the severe censure of the Pharisee, and that her faith in it might be strengthened; as also on his own account, to show that he was not only a prophet that had extraordinary knowledge of persons, and their characters, but that he was the most high God, to whom belonged the prerogative of pardoning sin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/luke/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-48.htm" title="And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.">Luke 7:48</a>.

The <span class="ital">is forgiven</span> of the previous verse is in the present, “<span class="ital">is being forgiven.”</span> Both in the Old and New Testaments the readiness of God to forgive the deepest and most numerous sins is dwelt upon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm" title="Come now, and let us reason together, said the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-7.htm" title="Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.">Isaiah 55:7</a>), and also the <span class="ital">absoluteness</span> of the forgiveness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-10.htm" title="Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.">1 John 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-19.htm" title="We love him, because he first loved us.">1 John 4:19</a>). There is an obvious analogy between the little parable of the debtors and that of the uncompassionate servant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/18-23.htm" title="Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain king, which would take account of his servants....">Matthew 18:23-27</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-48.htm" title="And he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.">Luke 7:48</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀφέωνται</span>, <span class="ital">are forgiven</span>) Forgiveness is not now for the first time given to the woman, but is confirmed to her. The greatest sinners often become the largest vessels of grace. Even at table the Saviour used “the power of the keys.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven</span>. Then, turning again to the woman, in her deep penitence, and at the same time in her deep joy - joy springing from her newly found peace - he formally renews to her the assurance of that pardon which she already was conscious of; but in renewing it the Lord mentioned no more "her many sins," as in the first place (ver. 47), but simply, "thy sins," thus reducing, as Stier remarks, at last both her and Simon to a common level. </body></html>
