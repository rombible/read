So little was thy love to me. It was customary with the Jews to show respect and kindness to their welcome guests, by saluting them with a kiss, by washing their feet, and anointing their heads with oil, or some fine ointment. It is possible Simon might omit some of these civilities, lest his brethren, who sat at the table with him, should think he paid Jesus too much respect; and, if there was any such slight intended, it might be an additional reason for our Lord’s taking such particular notice of the neglect. <span class="ital">But this woman, since the time I came in </span>— Or rather, as many copies read it, <span class="greekheb">εισηλθεν</span>, <span class="ital">she came in, hath not ceased to kiss </span>even <span class="ital">my feet</span> — With the greatest humility and affection. <span class="ital">My head with oil thou didst not anoint </span>— Though few entertainments fail of being attended with that circumstance, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-40.htm" title="You shall have olive trees throughout all your coasts, but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olive shall cast his fruit.">Deuteronomy 28:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-15.htm" title="You shall sow, but you shall not reap; you shall tread the olives, but you shall not anoint you with oil; and sweet wine, but shall not drink wine.">Micah 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-5.htm" title="Then shall he speak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.">Psalm 2:5</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm" title="And wine that makes glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengthens man's heart.">Psalm 104:15</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-5.htm" title="Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.">Psalm 141:5</a>;) but she, as thou seest, <span class="ital">hath anointed my feet with </span>precious and fragrant <span class="ital">ointment; wherefore I say unto thee </span>— I declare it openly, both for her vindication and for thy admonition; <span class="ital">her sins, which are many </span>— And exceedingly heinous, as I well know; <span class="ital">are forgiven </span>— Freely and graciously; <span class="ital">for </span>— Rather, <span class="ital">therefore, </span>as <span class="greekheb">οτι </span>undoubtedly ought here to be translated, <span class="ital">she loved much </span>— As I have been the means of bringing her to repentance, and to enjoy pardon and peace, she has thus testified the great love and high regard she has for me, as being persuaded that she never can sufficiently express her sense of the obligation. <span class="ital">But to whom little is forgiven </span>— Or who thinks his debt was but small; <span class="ital">the same loveth little</span> — Is not much affected with the kindness of the creditor that forgives him: and feels but little gratitude and love to him on that account. The substance, therefore, of our Lord’s answer to the Pharisee is, “It is true, this woman has been a great sinner; but she is a <span class="ital">pardoned sinner, </span>which supposes her to be a <span class="ital">penitent sinner: </span>what she has done to me, is an expression of her great love to me, her Saviour, by whom her sins are forgiven: and as she is pardoned, who was so great a sinner, it may reasonably be expected that she will love her Saviour more than others, and give greater proofs of it; and if this be the fruit of her love, flowing from a sense of the pardon of her sins, it becomes me to accept of it, and ill becomes any to be offended at it.” It must be carefully observed here, that her love is mentioned as the <span class="ital">effect </span>and <span class="ital">evidence, </span>not the <span class="ital">cause </span>of her pardon. She knew that much had been forgiven her, and therefore she loved much. It is true, Jesus had not yet given her any express intimation in word of the pardon of her sins; yet, having, by his sermons and his grace attending her hearing them, brought her to true repentance, without doubt she was assured of her pardon by the general doctrine of the gospel, which she had heard; by the promise of <span class="ital">rest, </span>which Jesus had lately made to all weary and heavy-laden sinners; and especially by <span class="ital">the Spirit of adoption, </span>which he had sent into her heart, sealing forgiveness upon her conscience, begetting her again to immortal hopes, and filling her with joy and peace, through believing that God was pacified toward her after all she had done.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As a further proof of the justness of this interpretation, it may not be improper to produce here the following testimony of Dr. Whitby: “Christ saith not her sins are forgiven <span class="ital">because she loved much, </span>but this ought to be a token, that her sins, which rendered her unworthy to touch me, have been forgiven; this great love to me being an indication of her deep sense of God’s mercy to her in pardoning her many sins; and this do I, the prophet and the <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of God, </span>declare unto her. To this sense lead both the parable of the great debtor, to whom his lord frankly had forgiven all, <span class="ital">for he loved much </span>because much had been forgiven, and the conclusion of it, in these words, <span class="ital">he that hath little forgiven, loveth little. </span>Whence it appears, that <span class="greekheb">οτι </span>here cannot be causal, or intimate that she was forgiven much because she loved much; the cause assigned of her forgiveness being, not her love, but faith, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-50.htm" title="And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.">Luke 7:50</a>; but only consequential, denoting the effect, or indication of the forgiveness of her many sins. So, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-15.htm" title="All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house, I will love them no more: all their princes are rebels.">Hosea 9:15</a>, all their iniquity was in Gilgal, <span class="greekheb">οτι</span>, <span class="ital">therefore there I hated them; </span>for they did not sin in Gilgal because he hated them there; but he hated them there because there they offended.” Thus also Dr. Campbell, who translates the words, <span class="ital">Therefore her love is great, </span>observing, “The whole context shows that the particle <span class="greekheb">οτι </span>is illative, and not causal, in this place. The parable of the debtors clearly represents the gratuitous forgiveness as the cause of the love, not the love as the cause of the forgiveness. And this, on the other hand, is, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-50.htm" title="And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you; go in peace.">Luke 7:50</a> th, ascribed to her faith.” Observe, reader, 1st, The Pharisee doubted whether Jesus was a prophet or not, nay, he, in effect, denied it; but Christ here shows that he was <span class="ital">more than a prophet, </span>that he was one who had power on earth to forgive sins, and to whom the affections and thankful acknowledgments of penitent sinners were due; in other words, that he was the Messiah, the Son of God, whose sole prerogative and right it was, in conjunction with the Father, to forgive men’s sins. 2d, In testifying that this pardoned sinner <span class="ital">loved much, </span>because she had had much forgiven, and in signifying that <span class="ital">to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little; </span>he intimated to the Pharisee, that his love to Christ was so little, that he had reason to question whether he loved him at all in sincerity; and consequently, whether indeed his sins, though comparatively little, were forgiven him. From this we learn that, instead of grudging great sinners the mercy they find with Christ upon their repentance, we ought to be excited by their example to examine ourselves, whether we be indeed forgiven, and do at all love Christ. “Our Lord did not make the application of this parable more directly, but left Simon to do it, because he could not but see that if love invites love, and merits a return, Jesus would have been ungenerous had he treated this woman with rudeness and contempt. Having expressed greater love to him, she deserved higher returns of gratitude from him than even Simon himself; for which reason he was not to blame when he allowed her to wash his feet with her tears, wipe them with the hairs of her head, kiss them, and anoint them with fragrant ointment.” <span class="ital">And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven </span>— Having vindicated her, he spake kindly to her, and assured her, in express terms, that her sins, of which he knew she had truly repented, were actually forgiven.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:36-50 None can truly perceive how precious Christ is, and the glory of the gospel, except the broken-hearted. But while they feel they cannot enough express self-abhorrence on account of sin, and admiration of his mercy, the self-sufficient will be disgusted, because the gospel encourages such repenting sinners. The Pharisee, instead of rejoicing in the tokens of the woman's repentance, confined his thoughts to her former bad character. But without free forgiveness none of us can escape the wrath to come; this our gracious Saviour has purchased with his blood, that he may freely bestow it on every one that believes in him. Christ, by a parable, forced Simon to acknowledge that the greater sinner this woman had been, the greater love she ought to show to Him when her sins were pardoned. Learn here, that sin is a debt; and all are sinners, are debtors to Almighty God. Some sinners are greater debtors; but whether our debt be more or less, it is more than we are able to pay. God is ready to forgive; and his Son having purchased pardon for those who believe in him, his gospel promises it to them, and his Spirit seals it to repenting sinners, and gives them the comfort. Let us keep far from the proud spirit of the Pharisee, simply depending upon and rejoicing in Christ alone, and so be prepared to obey him more zealously, and more strongly to recommend him unto all around us. The more we express our sorrow for sin, and our love to Christ, the clearer evidence we have of the forgiveness of our sins. What a wonderful change does grace make upon a sinner's heart and life, as well as upon his state before God, by the full remission of all his sins through faith in the Lord Jesus!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seest thou this woman? - You see what this woman has done to me, compared with what you have done.
