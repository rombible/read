It clearly pointed out the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, that the messenger he sent before him to prepare his way, did it by preaching repentance and reformation of heart and life. We have here the just blame of those who were not wrought upon by the ministry of John Baptist or of Jesus Christ himself. They made a jest of the methods God took to do them good. This is the ruin of multitudes; they are not serious in the concerns of their souls. Let us study to prove ourselves children of Wisdom, by attending the instructions of God's word, and adoring those mysteries and glad tidings which infidels and Pharisees deride and blaspheme.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this passage explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/11-16.htm">Matthew 11:16-19</a>.

But the children of Wisdom recognize and honor her, whether in the austere garb of the Baptist or in the more attractive style of his Master, whether in the Law or in the Gospel, whether in rags or in royalty, for "the full soul loatheth an honeycomb, but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet" (Pr 27:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-31.htm" title="And, behold, you shall conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS.">Luke 1:31</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But wisdom is justified of all her children. That is, Christ, who is the wisdom of God, and who acted the wise part, in behaving in such a free manner with all sorts of men, and even with publicans and sinners, whereby he became useful to their souls, called them to repentance, converted and saved them: and these are his children, which were given him by the Father; for whose sake he partook of flesh and blood, and whom he redeemed, that they might receive the adoption of children; and to whom, believing in him, he gives power to become the children of God: and these justify him from all such scandalous imputations, and by their lives and conversations show, that the doctrine of Christ is not a licentious one, or leads to libertinism, and indulges men in their carnal sensual lusts and pleasures; but, on the contrary, teaches them to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly: the word "all", is inserted by Luke, which is not in Matthew; signifying, that this is the universal sense and practice of all the real offspring of Christ, the sons of wisdom, who are wise to do good. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But wisdom is justified of all her children.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-35.htm" title="But wisdom is justified of all her children.">Luke 7:35</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>, etc., and wisdom is wont to be justified by all her children; by all who are themselves wise, not foolish and unreasonable like the “generation” described.

The Jews, like the petulant children, refused to sympathise either with John or Jesus—the one they condemned for exaggerated strictness, the other for dangerous laxity: yet the Wise,—Wisdom’s true children—once for all declare that she is righteous, and free from blame: for they know that wisdom is <span class="ital">polu- poikilos,</span> ‘richly-variegated,’ ‘of many colours,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>.

Wisdom is thus justified by her children both actively and passively; <span class="ital">they</span> declare her to be just and holy, and the <span class="ital">world</span> ultimately sees that her guidance as exemplified by their lives is the best guidance (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/5-5.htm" title="How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot is among the saints!">Wis 5:5</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/5-4.htm" title="We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to be without honour:">Wis 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-4.htm" title="Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight: that you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge.">Psalm 51:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm" title="God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.">Romans 3:4</a>).

But wisdom is justified of her children.">Matthew 11:19</a>, where He does not express until the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-25.htm" title="But what went you out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously appareled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts.">Luke 7:25</a> that which these words might otherwise be thought to denote, <span class="ital">but all her children have justified wisdom</span>): and moreover transfers, as it were indirectly, the complaint from the hypothesis, viz. concerning the perverseness of the men of that time, to the thesis, viz. concerning the perpetual and habitual characteristic of the Jewish people, just as He has also transferred it in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-47.htm" title="Woe to you! for you build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them....">Luke 11:47-48</a>. It is to this that the adjective <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span>, <span class="ital">all</span>, has reference: this also is the intention of the use of the past time (wherein often is included the force of the verb, <span class="ital">is wont</span>) in <span class="ital">has been</span> (habitually) <span class="ital">justified</span> (whereas, <span class="ital">ye say</span>, in the present time, precedes: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-34.htm" title="The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and you say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners!">Luke 7:34</a>): this also is the reason of the employment of the term, <span class="ital">Wisdom</span> [viz. as appropriate when speaking, as here, of a fact habitual in all times]; for He is no longer now called <span class="ital">the Son of man</span>, as in the preceding verse, but <span class="ital">Wisdom</span>: and of these terms the one (Son of man) is suitable to Christ’s manifested state; the other (Wisdom) to all times: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-49.htm" title="Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:">Luke 11:49</a>. Furthermore He is called in this place <span class="ital">Wisdom</span>, inasmuch as He Himself best knows what is to be done; and His own actions, replete with the purest accommodation [adaptation] to sinners, ought not to have been called to account. Add <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-1.htm" title="Does not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?">Proverbs 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-32.htm" title="Now therefore listen to me, O you children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.">Proverbs 8:32</a>. The children of this Wisdom are not Pharisees, and those like them (which otherwise would not be inappropriate to be said here; comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-34.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kill the prophets, and stone them that are sent to you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen does gather her brood under her wings, and you would not!">Luke 13:34</a>, at the end, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-12.htm" title="But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.">Matthew 8:12</a>); but the Apostles, as well as all publicans and sinners who had been converted to Jesus out of the whole people; whom He thus names, in order to show His own tie of connection with them, and His right of associating with them, and the perverseness of the calumniators. In Thucydides and other writers, <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span>, <span class="ital">to justify</span>, when used of a person, denotes <span class="ital">to pass sentence</span> or <span class="ital">fix a punishment against</span> (to be inflicted on) <span class="ital">any one, and that a just sentence or punishment</span>; when used of a thing, it denotes <span class="ital">to account anything just</span>. Gataker, Diss. de stilo Novi Instr. cap. 8, proves this in opposition to Pfochenius, and considers this to be an altogether striking instance of Biblical Græcism beins different from the Greek style of the heathen classics: for in the sacred writings <span class="greekheb">הצדיק</span>, <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span>, signifies to give one’s judgment in favour of any one, or in other words, to pronounce one just, whether by a just or unjust judgment. Comp. note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δικαιοῦσθαι</span>, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/18-22.htm" title="Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vow in due time, and defer not until death to be justified.">Sir 18:22</a>, is the same as <span class="greekheb">ἀποδοῦναι</span>: for he who owes a debt is as it were arraigned [a defendant]; he who pays it [<span class="greekheb">ἀποδίδωσι</span>], or makes good what he was bound to make good, is set free [<span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦται</span>]. French, s’acquitter [to pay off, lit. to acquit one’s self]. And yet we are not to think that both senses of the term cannot be reduced to the one notion, justifying; for the judge accounts that satisfaction has been given him, both in the case of him who has borne his full punishment, and in the case of him who has been acquitted, and thence that both are in his eyes just. There is in the former use of the word the additional element of an Euphemism, which is not needed in the latter. In this passage also <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span> is employed in the good sense: and <span class="greekheb">ἐδικαιώθη</span>, has been justified, contains a Metonymy of the consequent for the antecedent (for every justification presupposes an accusation, a cause at issue and some controversy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm" title="God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.">Romans 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-16.htm" title="And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.">Genesis 44:16</a>, LXX.: [and so here the consequent, has been justified, is put instead of the antecedent, has been subjected to trial]), combined with a strong Euphemism. Wisdom has been justified; that is to say, accusers have brought her to trial, have been offended at her, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-23.htm" title="And blessed is he, whoever shall not be offended in me.">Luke 7:23</a>, and have brought the matter to such a pass, that she has been at length obliged to have herself justified, and to be vindicated as just, and that it should be shown, that all her actions have been so ordered as to swallow up (counteract) injustice, and fulfil righteousness; whereas, however, she ought to have been embraced without any objection being raised to need justification of her. A similar passage occurs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-21.htm" title="But to Israel he said, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.">Romans 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/4-12.htm" title="And labor, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:...">1 Corinthians 4:12-13</a>. Wisdom has been defended and justified from the taunts of gluttony and wine-bibbing, thrown out against her; and that too by (<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ</span>) her own children, and by them all: on the part of all her own sons arose to her the necessity of justifying herself, and of defending all her actions along with them [as well as defending them]. See ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-22.htm" title="But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said to them, What reason you in your hearts?">Luke 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-30.htm" title="But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?">Luke 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-33.htm" title="And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but your eat and drink?">Luke 5:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-2.htm" title="And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?">Luke 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-7.htm" title="And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him.">Luke 6:7</a>, and in this 7th chapter itself <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-40.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to you.
