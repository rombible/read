Looking, however, at the manifest dislocation of facts in one or both of the Gospels, St. Matthew placing between the Sermon on the Mount and the healing of the centurion’s servant, the healing of the leper, which St. Luke gives in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/5-12.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and sought him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.">Luke 5:12-16</a>, the agreement in this instance can hardly be looked at as more than accidental.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/7-1.htm" title="Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum....">Luke 7:1-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">When he had ended all his sayings </span>— Namely, those contained in the preceding chapter; <span class="ital">in the audience of the people </span>— For though his discourse was immediately addressed to his disciples, he delivered it in the hearing of the people who stood round him in the plain; <span class="ital">he entered into Capernaum </span>— Near which town the plain was in which he had preached. <span class="ital">And a certain centurion’s servant was sick </span>— See some of the circumstances of the miracle explained on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-5.htm" title="And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,...">Matthew 8:5-10</a>. <span class="ital">And when he heard of Jesus </span>— Of his miracles and of his arrival at Capernaum; <span class="ital">he sent unto him the elders of the Jews — “Magistratus oppidi, aut præpositos synagogæ, </span>either the magistrates of the town, or the rulers of the synagogue.” — Grotius. For, as it was anciently the custom of the Jews to intrust the management of public affairs to persons advanced in years, as having most wisdom and experience, they called all who discharged those offices <span class="ital">elders, </span>even when, in later times, they were admitted to them without any regard to their age at all. It is plain, from the more circumstantial account here given of this miracle by Luke, than that given by Matthew, that when the latter says, <span class="ital">There came unto him a centurion, beseeching him, </span>&c., he is not to be understood as signifying that the centurion came in person, but only by his messengers. Indeed, it is usual in all languages, especially in the Hebrew, to ascribe to a person himself the things which are done, and the words which are spoken, by his order. Accordingly, Matthew relates as said by the centurion himself, what others said by order from him. An instance of the same kind we have in the case of Zebedee’s children: from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-20.htm" title="Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.">Matthew 20:20</a>, we learn it was their mother that spoke those words which, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/10-35.htm" title="And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Master, we would that you should do for us whatever we shall desire....">Mark 10:35-37</a>, they themselves are said to speak; because she was only their mouth. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm" title="When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,">John 4:1</a>, Jesus is said to baptize, when he baptized by his disciples. And <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-1.htm" title="Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.">John 19:1</a>, Pilate is said to take and scourge Jesus, when he did it only by his soldiers. Thus, in the following Jewish proverbs, adduced by Le Clerc on this passage, “The messenger of any man is as, or equal to, the man himself. The ambassador of a king is as, or equal to the king.” And nothing is more frequent, even at this day, in our courts of law, than to say that a person <span class="ital">comes into the court, </span>and asks a thing, which he asks perhaps only <span class="ital">at the third </span>hand, — by the <span class="ital">counsel, </span>whom his <span class="ital">solicitor </span>has employed in his cause. <span class="ital">They besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy </span>— This centurion seems to have been what they called a <span class="ital">proselyte of righteousness; </span>for he was a lover of the Jewish nation, on account of their religion, and therefore had built them a synagogue: which attachment to them, and uncommon generosity, had made him greatly beloved in that country. Hence these elders of Capernaum, where he now resided, heartily espoused his cause on this occasion, presented his petition to Jesus, and urged it also from the consideration of his character. <span class="ital">Then Jesus went with them </span>— As he constantly embraced every opportunity of doing good, whether to the bodies or souls of men; so he did not decline this that was now offered him, but cheerfully went with the elders as they desired, in order to heal the centurion’s servant. <span class="ital">And when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him — </span>In the way, some of the centurion’s friends, whom he had sent, met Jesus with a message from him, in which he expressed the highest opinion of our Lord’s power, and desired him not to take the trouble of coming, but to order the cure, which he knew he could easily do. <span class="ital">When Jesus heard these things he marvelled at him </span>— Admired him, on account of his great humility, and the strength of his faith. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-5.htm" title="And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,">Matthew 8:5</a>. <span class="ital">And turned him about, and said unto the people </span>— With great solemnity; <span class="ital">I say unto you </span>— What it is of great importance that you should consider and lay to heart; <span class="ital">I have not found so great faith </span>— As now appears in this stranger; <span class="ital">no, not in Israel </span>— In all my journeys through the country, and converse with its inhabitants. Observe, reader, Christ will have those that follow him to observe and consider the great examples of faith that are sometimes set before them; especially when any such are found among those who do not profess to follow Christ so closely as they do; in order that, by considering the strength of the faith of such, they may be ashamed of the weakness and wavering of their own. <span class="ital">And they, returning, found the servant whole </span>— The cure was immediately and perfectly wrought. Observe also, 1st, The kindness of this centurion to his servant, and the anxiety he showed to get him cured, were suitable to the character of a humane master, and exhibit an excellent pattern of duty, very fit to be imitated by Christian masters, with whom it is but too common to treat their servants and dependants as if they were not creatures of the same rank with themselves, but of an inferior order. 2d, Christ will take cognizance of the distressed case of poor servants, and be ready to relieve them; for there is no respect of persons with him. Nor are the Gentiles excluded from the benefit of his grace. Nay, this was a specimen of that much greater faith which would be found among the Gentiles, when the gospel should be preached to them, than among the Jews.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-10 Servants should study to endear themselves to their masters. Masters ought to take particular care of their servants when they are sick. We may still, by faithful and fervent prayer, apply to Christ, and ought to do so when sickness is in our families. The building places for religious worship is a good work, and an instance of love to God and his people. Our Lord Jesus was pleased with the centurion's faith; and he never fails to answer the expectations of that faith which honours his power and love. The cure soon wrought and perfect.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the audience of the people - In the hearing of the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 7<p>Lu 7:1-10.

We have in it remarkable, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The humanity of the centurion to his servant, to teach us Christians to do the like. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The profitableness of good works: the centurion’s love to the Jews in building them a synagogue gains their applications to Christ for him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. The humility of the centurion: he did not think himself worthy to appear in Christ’s presence, nor to receive Christ into his house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. His faith in Christ’s Divine power and goodness. It doth not appear that he believed that Christ was the eternal Son of God, but he did at least believe that he was clothed with a Divine power, or had a Divine power communicated to him from God, by which he was able, at a distance, and by no more than a word, without application of human rational means, to command off the distemper of his servant. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. The power of faith in God, and its acceptableness to him. Christ doth not only effect the cure, but predicate his faith to be greater than he had found amongst the generality of the Jewish nation, who went for the only people of God at that day, and had much more light, and means to discern that Christ was sent of God for the good of men, than this Roman captain had. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now when he had ended all his sayings,....
