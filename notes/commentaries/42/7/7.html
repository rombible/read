Masters ought to take particular care of their servants when they are sick. We may still, by faithful and fervent prayer, apply to Christ, and ought to do so when sickness is in our families. The building places for religious worship is a good work, and an instance of love to God and his people. Our Lord Jesus was pleased with the centurion's faith; and he never fails to answer the expectations of that faith which honours his power and love.

He had risen above the need of an outward sign, such as a touch or even the sound of a living voice. He needed no contact with the fringe of the Master's garment, asked for no handkerchief or apron that had touched his person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm">Acts 19:12</a>). The word the Master would speak would be enough; the result he willed would assuredly follow. "Do not come hither where my servant is, but only <span class="accented">speak here</span> where thou art." The centurion had a just notion of Christ's power. And our Lord greatly commended him, whereas Martha, who said, "I know whatsoever thou shalt ask of God he will <span class="accented">give it</span> thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-22.htm">John 11:22</a>) was reproved as having spoken amiss; and Christ thus teaches that he is the Source of blessings, which he could not be unless he were God (compare Bishop Wordsworth, in part quoting from St. Chrysostom). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Say in a word<p>Lit., "say with a word."<p>My servant shall be healed (&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>It is strange that the Rev. should have omitted to note the imperative mood here, at least in the margin.
