And he said, Master, say on....">Luke 7:40-43</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jesus answering </span>— What Simon spake within himself; <span class="ital">said, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee </span>— Though he was kindly entertained at his table, yet even there he judged it proper to reprove him for what he saw amiss in him, and not to suffer sin upon him. This he does, however, in a most tender and courteous manner. <span class="ital">And he saith, Master, </span><span class="greekheb">διδασκαλε</span>, <span class="ital">teacher, say on </span>— Though Simon would not believe him to be a prophet, because he suffered so great a sinner to touch him, yet he could compliment him with the title of <span class="ital">teacher, </span>like those that say to him, <span class="ital">Lord, Lord, </span>but do not the things which he enjoins. Then Jesus immediately delivered the following parable as a just, yet mild reproof of his host. <span class="ital">A certain creditor had two debtors </span>— That were both insolvent; <span class="ital">the one owed five hundred pence </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">δηναρια</span>, Roman pence, in value about seven pence halfpenny sterling, so that five hundred of them were nearly equivalent to fifteen guineas sterling, and fifty to one guinea and a half. There is no reason to believe that there was any mystery intended in Christ’s fixing on these sums, rather than any others that had as great a difference between them. <span class="ital">And when they had nothing to pay </span>— Could neither of them discharge any part of this debt; <span class="ital">he frankly forgave them both </span>— The whole of what they respectively owed: <span class="ital">Tell me, therefore </span>— Since it may be reasonably expected that both would have some sense of, and gratitude for his goodness; <span class="ital">which of them would love him most — </span>In return for this his great kindness and generosity? Observe, reader, neither of them would love him at all before he had forgiven him. An insolvent debtor, till he is forgiven, does not <span class="ital">love, </span>but shun his creditor. <span class="ital">Simon answered, He to whom he forgave most </span>— He surely was under the greatest obligations, and must reasonably be supposed to feel the greatest affection for his merciful and generous creditor: <span class="ital">And he said, Thou hast rightly judged </span>— And the reflection is evidently suited to the case that we have before us.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:36-50 None can truly perceive how precious Christ is, and the glory of the gospel, except the broken-hearted. But while they feel they cannot enough express self-abhorrence on account of sin, and admiration of his mercy, the self-sufficient will be disgusted, because the gospel encourages such repenting sinners. The Pharisee, instead of rejoicing in the tokens of the woman's repentance, confined his thoughts to her former bad character. But without free forgiveness none of us can escape the wrath to come; this our gracious Saviour has purchased with his blood, that he may freely bestow it on every one that believes in him. Christ, by a parable, forced Simon to acknowledge that the greater sinner this woman had been, the greater love she ought to show to Him when her sins were pardoned. Learn here, that sin is a debt; and all are sinners, are debtors to Almighty God. Some sinners are greater debtors; but whether our debt be more or less, it is more than we are able to pay. God is ready to forgive; and his Son having purchased pardon for those who believe in him, his gospel promises it to them, and his Spirit seals it to repenting sinners, and gives them the comfort. Let us keep far from the proud spirit of the Pharisee, simply depending upon and rejoicing in Christ alone, and so be prepared to obey him more zealously, and more strongly to recommend him unto all around us. The more we express our sorrow for sin, and our love to Christ, the clearer evidence we have of the forgiveness of our sins. What a wonderful change does grace make upon a sinner's heart and life, as well as upon his state before God, by the full remission of all his sins through faith in the Lord Jesus!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He spake within himself - Thought.<p>If he were a prophet - The word "prophet" here means, not one who predicts future events, but one who knows the hearts of people. If Jesus had been sent from God as a prophet, he supposed that he would have known the character of the woman and would have rebuked her.<p>Would have known ... - Because Jesus did not rebuke her and drive her from his presence, he inferred that he could not be acquainted with her character. The Pharisees considered it improper to hold communion with those who were notorious sinners. They judged our Saviour by their own rules, and supposed that "he" would act in the same way; and Simon therefore concluded that he did not know her character and could not be a prophet. Jesus did not refuse the society of the guilty. He came to save the lost; and no person ever came to him so sure of finding a "friend," as those who came conscious that they were deeply depraved, and mourning on account of their crimes.<p>That toucheth him - The "touch" of a Gentile, or a person singularly wicked, they supposed to be polluting, and the Pharisees avoided it. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-11.htm">Matthew 9:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40-43. Like Nathan with David, our Lord conceals His home thrust under the veil of a parable, and makes His host himself pronounce upon the case. The two debtors are the woman and Simon; the criminality of the one was ten times that of the other (in the proportion of "five hundred" to "fifty"); but both being equally insolvent, both are with equal frankness forgiven; and Simon is made to own that the greatest debtor to forgiving mercy will cling to her Divine Benefactor with the deepest gratitude. Does our Lord then admit that Simon was a forgiving man? Let us see.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 40-48. Our Saviour treats his host civilly, but yet letteth him know, that he both knew his heart, and the heart of this poor woman, whom he had so uncharitably reflected upon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Simon spake within himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-39.htm" title="Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him: for she is a sinner.">Luke 7:39</a></span>. Christ lets him know that he knew the thoughts of his heart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I have</span> (saith he) <span class="bld">somewhat to say unto thee</span>. So he civilly obtaineth leave of him to speak. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Simon saith, Master, say on.</span> Our Saviour tells him: <span class="bld">There was a certain creditor, </span>& c. It is obvious by our Saviour’s application of this parable, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/7-44.htm" title="And he turned to the woman, and said to Simon, See you this woman? I entered into your house, you gave me no water for my feet: but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head....">Luke 7:44-47</a></span>, that he whom Christ here intends under the notion of a creditor is God; that one of the debtors that did owe five hundred pence (that is, a great sum) was this woman: whether Simon were intended by the other, or no, is not easily determined; but admit the other was o deina, any one that was a sinner, but not so notorious a sinner, God forgives freely both the one and the other. Christ asks which would love most. Simon tells him, that debtor to whom most was forgiven. Christ tells him that he had judged rightly. Whence observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That as all sins, so all sinners, are not equal in the sight of God; all are guilty, but there are degrees in guilt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That be men’s sins less or greater, fewer or more, those who have least will stand in need of pardoning mercy and forgiveness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That God is free in the forgiveness of all sins, be they few or more; <span class="bld">he frankly forgave them both.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That Christ first speaketh of these two debtors as being forgiven, then of their loving much, and of their being forgiven as the cause of their loving much. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. That much love will follow a great forgiveness; a great sinner (one, I mean, who hath been so) will hardly ever be able to satisfy himself that his much is forgiven, if he doth not find his heart very warm with love to God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6. A true love to God and Christ will be seen in all acts, which may be demonstrative or declarative of it. Christ turns to the woman, and saith to Simon, &c. Kissing, washing of feet, anointing with oil, were usual compliments of those countries, by which men showed their respects and kindness to strangers and friends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For washing of feet, see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-4.htm" title="Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:">Genesis 18:4</a> 19:2 <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-21.htm" title="So he brought him into his house, and gave provender to the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.">Judges 19:21</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-41.htm" title="And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let your handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.">1 Samuel 25:41</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm" title="Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.">1 Timothy 5:10</a></span>. For anointing with oil, see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm" title="You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.">Psalm 23:5</a> 45:7</span>. This woman had exceeded the usual kindness and civility of the country toward Christ: they were wont to bring their friends water to wash their feet, and possibly a piece of linen to wipe them; she washes his feet with her tears, and drieth them with her hair. They used to anoint the head of their friends with oil, she anoints his feet. They used to kiss one another’s cheeks or lips, she kisses his feet. They kissed their friends once, she ceased not to kiss his feet. Upon this Christ, who before had forgiven her, declareth her to be forgiven, first in the hearing of Simon, then he doubles his words unto her. He had told Simon before that the creditor had frankly forgiven them both; his adding here, <span class="bld">Her sins, which are many, </span> sufficiently evidences that it was she whom he intended by the debtor who owed much. Hence we may judge how little ground the papists have to urge this place to prove, that remission of sins is procured by our own merits and satisfactions. Love here is not mentioned as the cause, but as the effect of the remission of sins; and that which our Saviour here designed to instruct Simon in, was, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That whatsoever this woman had been, she was not now such a notorious sinner as he fancied; her sins were forgiven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That God having thus favoured her with the grace of remission, had also kindled in her heart a love towards him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That this love wrought in her heart in some proportion to that love which God had magnified upon her, therefore she loved much. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That men and women’s love to God and Christ, will and ought to be according to that love which they have received from Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. That much love to God will bring a great sense of God’s love to the soul, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm" title="He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.">John 14:21</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The particle oti, which we translate <span class="ital">because, </span> doth not always in Scripture signify the cause, but may be translated <span class="ital">therefore, </span> or, <span class="ital">for what cause:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-17.htm" title="Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.">John 14:17</a></span>, <span class="ital">Ye know him; </span> for he <span class="ital">dwelleth in you:</span> the Spirit’s abiding in believers is not the cause of their knowing of him, but the effect of it, so that <span class="ital">for</span>, in that place, is as much as <span class="ital">therefore.</span> So in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-28.htm" title="And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?">Mark 9:28</a></span>, oti is as much as <span class="ital">for what cause, </span> or, <span class="ital">for what reason?</span> We translate it, <span class="ital">Why could not we cast him out?</span> So here, <span class="ital">her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for which cause, or reason, she loveth much.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jesus answering said unto him,....
