St. Luke is here, contrary to what we might have expected, less precise than St. Matthew, who states that the slave was “sick of the palsy.” Had the physician been unable to satisfy himself from what he heard as to the nature of the disease? The details that follow show that he had made inquiries, and was able to supply some details which St. Matthew had not given.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-10 Servants should study to endear themselves to their masters. Masters ought to take particular care of their servants when they are sick. We may still, by faithful and fervent prayer, apply to Christ, and ought to do so when sickness is in our families. The building places for religious worship is a good work, and an instance of love to God and his people. Our Lord Jesus was pleased with the centurion's faith; and he never fails to answer the expectations of that faith which honours his power and love.

A centurion was an officer in the Roman army: the grade answers to the modern European captain - German, <span class="accented">hauptmann</span>; the command included a hundred soldiers. Scholars are not agreed respecting the special service of this particular officer. Some consider he was a Greek or Syrian holding a commission under the prince of the country, the tetrach Herod Antipas; others, that he was in the service of the empire, with a small detachment of the garrison of Caesarea, doing duty at the important lake-city, probably in connection with the revenue. It is clear that Roman garrisons at this period were dotted about the various centres of population in these semi-dependent states. At Jerusalem we know a considerable Roman force was stationed, professedly to keep order in the turbulent capital, but really, no doubt, to overawe the national party. <span class="cmt_word">Was sick, and ready to die</span>. St. Matthew calls the disease paralysis, and adds that the sufferer was in extreme pain. The disorder was probably some dangerous form of rheumatic fever, which not unfrequently attacks the region of the heart, and is accompanied with severe pain, and proves in many instances fatal. The ordinary, paralysis would scarcely be accompanied with the acute pain mentioned by St. Matthew. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Centurion (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>From &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, a hundred, and &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;, to command. Commander of a hundred men. Mark uses &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, a Graecized form of the Latin word centurio. A centuria was originally a division consisting of a hundred things of a kind; and thence came to mean any division, whether consisting of a hundred or not. In military language it meant a division of troops, a company, not necessarily of a hundred, the captain of which was called centurio. The numbers of a century varied from about fifty to a hundred. The Roman legion consisted of ten cohorts or &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, bands, as" the Italian band," of which Cornelius was a centurion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a>). The commanders of these cohorts were called chiliarchs, or chief captains (<a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-12.htm">John 18:12</a>, Rev.). Each cohort contained six centuries, or companies, of which the commanders were called centurions. The duty of the centurion was chiefly confined to the regulation of his own corps, and the care of the watch. The badge of his office was the vitis, or vine-stock. He wore a short tunic, and was also known by letters on the crest of his helmet. Dean Howson ("Companions of St. Paul") remarks on the favorable impression left upon the mind by the officers of the Roman army mentioned in the New Testament, and cites, besides the centurion in this passage, the one at the cross, and Julius, who escorted Paul to Rome. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-1.htm">Acts 10:1</a>.<p>Servant (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>A bond-servant. Matthew has &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, a servant, which occurs also at <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-7.htm">Luke 7:7</a>.<p>Dear (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit. held in honor or value. It does not necessarily imply an affectionate relation between the master and the servant, though such may well have existed. It may mean only that he was a valuable servant. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-4.htm">1 Peter 2:4</a>. In this case Luke omits the mention of the disease, which is given by Matthew.<p>Beseeching (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Too strong. Better asking, as Rev. The word to beseech (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;) occurs in the next verse.
