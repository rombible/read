They made void God’s gracious and merciful design, with regard to themselves; or disappointed all the methods of his love, and would receive no benefit from them. By calling the gospel <span class="ital">the counsel of God, </span>the grandest idea of it possible is given. It is nothing less than the result of the deep consideration and deliberation of God; for which reason the crime of men’s rejecting it is very atrocious. Now, to show these Pharisees and lawyers the perverseness of their disposition, in resisting the evidence of John’s mission, and the gracious design of God in calling them to repentance by his ministry, he told them they were like children at play, who never do what their companions desire them, but are so froward and perverse that no contrivance can be found to please them. It is plain, our Lord means that they were like the children complained of, not like those that made the complaint. <span class="ital">Whereunto shall I liken, </span>&c. — See this passage elucidated in the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/11-16.htm" title="But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,...">Matthew 11:16-19</a>. <span class="ital">We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced, </span>&c. — The application of this proverb to the Pharisees our Lord justified by observing, that the Divine Wisdom had tried every method proper for converting them, but in vain. For, first of all, the Baptist was sent unto them in the stern dignity of their ancient prophets, so that it was natural to think they would have reverenced him; nevertheless, they rejected him altogether. <span class="ital">John came neither eating bread, </span>as others do, <span class="ital">nor drinking wine </span>— But living on locusts, and honey, and water, in the wilderness; <span class="ital">and ye say, He hath a devil </span>— He acts like a wild, distracted demoniac, whom an evil spirit drives from the society of men. Such, it seems, was the pride and malice of the Pharisees, that, when they found their own ostentatious and hypocritical mortifications utterly eclipsed by the real austerities of this holy man’s life, they impudently affirmed that his living in deserts, his shunning the company of men, the coarseness of his clothing, the abstemiousness of his diet, with other severities which he practised, were all the effects of madness, or religious melancholy. <span class="ital">The Son of man came eating and drinking </span>— The severity of John’s ministry proving unsuccessful, with respect to the conversion of the scribes and Pharisees, God sent his own Son to address and conduct himself toward them in a more free and familiar manner: but neither was this method successful in bringing them to repentance and newness of life. They said, <span class="ital">Behold a gluttonous man, </span>&c. — Ungratefully injuring his character for that humanity and condescension, which they should rather have applauded. <span class="ital">But Wisdom is justified in all her children </span>— The children of wisdom are those who are truly wise, <span class="ital">wise unto salvation, </span>and who prove themselves to be so by a sincere and ardent love of truth and goodness, of wisdom, piety, and virtue; and the wisdom of God in all these dispensations, these various ways of calling sinners to repentance, and in all the methods of his divine providence, however offensive they may be to wicked men, are readily owned and heartily approved of by all these, See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm" title="The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners.

It clearly pointed out the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, that the messenger he sent before him to prepare his way, did it by preaching repentance and reformation of heart and life. We have here the just blame of those who were not wrought upon by the ministry of John Baptist or of Jesus Christ himself. They made a jest of the methods God took to do them good. This is the ruin of multitudes; they are not serious in the concerns of their souls. Let us study to prove ourselves children of Wisdom, by attending the instructions of God's word, and adoring those mysteries and glad tidings which infidels and Pharisees deride and blaspheme.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The people - The common people.<p>That heard him - That heard "John."<p>The publicans - The tax-gatherers, the worst kind of people, who had, however, been converted.<p>Justified God - Considered God as "just" or "right" in the counsel which he gave by John - to wit, in calling people to repentance, and in denouncing future wrath on the impenitent.

Matthew hath not this addition to our Saviour’s commendation of John, but it is of great use to introduce our Saviour’s following discourse. The evangelist here divideth the hearers into two sorts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first were the common people and the publicans; the former were despised by the Jewish doctors and rabbis, as a rude, illiterate sort of people; the latter, as a notoriously wicked sort. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The second sort were the Pharisees and the lawyers; of the former, he saith, that they, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">being baptized with the baptism of John, justified God, </span> that is, they owned, and publicly declared, and predicated the goodness and justice of God; they approved of what God had done, and blessed his name for sending amongst them such a prophet as John was, they owned and received him, and were baptized by him.

It is here interpreted by those words, <span class="bld">being not baptized of him.</span> We must understand the sense of hyethsan by considering what is here meant by boulhn tou Yeou, <span class="bld">the counsel of God, </span> which some will understand concerning the purpose of God within himself; others, concerning his revealed will, his counsel as revealed to us. The matter seemeth to me but a strife about a word, which is sometimes taken in one sense, sometimes in another. The will of God is but one, only as every one of us keep some part of our mind to ourselves, and reveal other parts of it to our servants and children; so God, who hath determined and willed all events, concealeth some part of it from his creatures, and revealeth another part of it to them. It is the will of God that this, and that, and the other person should believe and be saved. He revealeth as to this thus much of his will, that whose believers shall be saved; but for that other part of his will, that this, and that, or the other man shall believe, this he concealeth, till he gives them a power to believe, and to receive the gospel, and then his will in this particular is revealed. Supposing then we here understand by boulhn tou yeou, God’s secret purpose to be understood, how is it proved that it must be understood of his secret purpose for their salvation? Why should it not be understood of the secret purpose and counsel of God to give them the means of life and salvation? God from all eternity purposed to give the Jews the ministry of John the Baptist and Christ, as means for their salvation, not which should be certainly effective of it, but that should have such a tendency towards it as without their own refusing, and opposing them, it should have been effective, and was in their own nature a proper means in order to it: they reject and refuse it; by this they rejected the counsel of God, the effect of his counsel, and so judged themselves unworthy of eternal life, by neglecting, despising, and rejecting the use of that means, which was the product of an eternal purpose to send them such means. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This counsel of God is said to be <span class="ital">rejected</span> towards or <span class="ital">against themselves:</span> take it as God’s act, it was towards themselves, that is, for their good; if we refer it to their act of rejection, or refusal, it was against themselves, a judging of themselves unworthy of eternal life. We cannot in this place translate it disannul, or frustrate, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-15.htm" title="Brothers, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man cancels, or adds thereto.">Galatians 3:15</a></span>, understanding it as to the Divine act; for who can frustrate or disannul the will or purpose of man, as to an act of his own, within his power to purpose? Though indeed as to the event it may be disannulled, as to any good effect as to another, if it be made to depend upon the action of another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Besides, what need any further explication of this phrase, of rejecting the counsel of God against themselves, than what followeth, <span class="ital">being not baptized of him, </span> that is, not receiving John’s doctrine of repentance for the remission of sins, and bringing forth fruits worthy of amendment of life, nor submitting to baptism as a testimony of such repentance; for the baptism of John in Scripture signifieth his whole administration, the doctrine he preached, as well as the ordinance of baptism by him administered; and so must be interpreted where our Saviour asked the Pharisees whether John’s baptism was from earth or from heaven, and they durst not say from heaven, lest Christ should have asked them, why then they believed him not? They were not baptized of him, is the same thing with, They would be none of his disciples. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all the people that heard him,.... Either Christ saying these things in commendation of John, and gave their assent to them, and showed their approbation of them, having been baptized by him; or rather, the people that had heard John preach the doctrines of repentance and faith, and of baptism; for these words seem rather to be the words of Christ, relating the success of John's ministry among different persons: <p>and the publicans justified God; even those wicked men, who were before profligate and abandoned sinners, when they came under John's ministry, were so wrought upon by the power and grace of God through it, that they approved of, and applauded the wisdom, goodness, and grace of God, in sending such a prophet as John; in qualifying him in the manner he did, and giving in him a commission to preach such doctrines, and administer such an ordinance as he did: and this their approbation of the divine conduct, and their thankfulness for the same, they testified by their <p>being baptized with the baptism of John; they expressed their sentiments by their obedience; they declared it was right in God to institute such an ordinance, and for John to administer it; and that it became them to submit to it, as a part of righteousness to be fulfilled; they hereby signified, that they thought that it was agreeable to the nature of God, who is holy, just, and good, suitable to the Gospel dispensation, and very fit and proper for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And all the people that heard <i>him</i>, and the publicans, <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</span><p>(c) Said that he was just, good, faithful and merciful.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/7-29.htm" title="And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John....">Luke 7:29-30</a> are best taken as a historical reflection by the evangelist. Its prosaic character, as compared with what goes before and comes after, compels this conclusion, as even Hahn admits. Then its absence from Mt.’s account points in the same direction. It has for its aim to indicate to what extent the popular judgment had endorsed the estimate just offered by Jesus. The whole people, even the publicans, had, by submitting to be baptised by John, acknowledged his legitimacy and power as a prophet of God, and so “justified” (<span class="greekheb">ἐδικαίωσαν</span>) God in sending him as the herald of the coming Messianic Kingdom and King, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, recognised him as the fit man for so high a vocation. To be strictly correct he is obliged, contrary to his wont, to refer to the Pharisees and lawyers as exceptions, describing them as making void, frustrating (<span class="greekheb">ἠθέτησαν</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-21.htm" title="I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.">Galatians 2:21</a>) the counsel of God with reference to themselves. The two words <span class="greekheb">ἐδικ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἠθέτ</span>. are antithetic, and help to define each other. The latter meaning to treat with contempt and so set aside, the former must mean to approve God’s counsel or ordinance in the mission of the Baptist. Kypke renders: <span class="ital">laudarunt Deum</span>, citing numerous instances of this sense from the <span class="ital">Psalt. Solom.</span>—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἑαυτοὺς</span> after <span class="greekheb">ἠθέτησαν</span> has been variously rendered = “against themselves” (A. V[76]) and = “for themselves,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, in so far as they were concerned (R. V[77]; “quantum ab eis pendebat,” Bornemann). But the latter would require <span class="greekheb">τὸ εἰς ἑαυτούς</span>. The meaning is plain enough. God’s counsel very specially concerned the Pharisees and lawyers, for none in Israel more needed to repent than they. Therefore the phrase = they frustrated God’s counsel (in John’s mission), which was for (concerned) the whole Jewish people, and its religious leaders very particularly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[76] Authorised Version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[77] Revised Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">justified God</span>] i.e. they bore witness that God was just; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-35.htm" title="But wisdom is justified of all her children.">Luke 7:35</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-4.htm" title="Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight: that you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge.">Psalm 51:4</a>, “that Thou mightest be justified when Thou speakest, and be clear when Thou art judged,” and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-26.htm" title="To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.">Romans 3:26</a><span class="ital">.</span> St Luke has already made prominent mention of the publicans at the baptism of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-12.htm" title="If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?">John 3:12</a><span class="ital">.</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-29.htm" title="And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.">Luke 7:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ πᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">and all</span>) Luke sets forth what the people did, and what on the other hand the Pharisees did, in order that he may show, why Jesus spake at the one time those things which are joined together by both verses.[73] A similar division of the sentence is to be seen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-6.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.">Matthew 9:6</a>.[74]—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΚΟΎΣΑς</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">having heard</span>) John.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>) <span class="ital">and</span> [that is] especially the publicans, whom others had most despaired of as irreclaimable.—<span class="greekheb">ἐδικαίωσαν</span>, <span class="ital">justified</span>) They approved and submitted to the ordinance of God, the baptism of repentance, as being <span class="ital">just</span>.
