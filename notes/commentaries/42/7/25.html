Such forms of selfishness were common among the house of Herod and their followers. So Josephus describes the “royal apparel” of Agrippa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-21.htm" title="And on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his throne, and made an oration to them.">Acts 12:21</a>) as glittering with gold and silver tissues. The words must have gone home to some of the Herodians, and we may trace a touch of brutal vindictiveness in the “gorgeous” or “<span class= "ital">bright</span> robe,” in which they arrayed the Prophet of Nazareth when they had Him in their power. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm" title="And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.">Luke 23:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-8.htm" title="But what went you out for to see?

It clearly pointed out the spiritual nature of Christ's kingdom, that the messenger he sent before him to prepare his way, did it by preaching repentance and reformation of heart and life. We have here the just blame of those who were not wrought upon by the ministry of John Baptist or of Jesus Christ himself. They made a jest of the methods God took to do them good. This is the ruin of multitudes; they are not serious in the concerns of their souls.

Such as the palaces of the Herods which they had seen at Tiberias, Caesarea Philippi, and Jerusalem. We might almost fancy an allusion to Manaen the Essene, who is said in the Talmud to have openly adopted gorgeous robes to shew his allegiance to Herod. To the Herodians generally, and to all whose Judaism was a mere matter of gain and court favour, might have been applied the sneering nickname of the Talmud ‘Proselytes of the royal table’ (<span class="ital">Gere Shulchan Melachim. Kiddushin</span>, f. 65. 2; Gratz, in. 308). John had been in palaces, but only to counsel and reprove. Our Lord on the only two occasions on which He entered palaces—on the last day of His life—was mocked by “<span class="ital">bright apparel</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm" title="And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.">Luke 23:11</a>), and a purple or scarlet robe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-28.htm" title="And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.">Matthew 27:28</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But what went ye out for to see?

John was no court favourite, no powerful or princely noble. Dean Plumptre thinks that here a reference is made to the fact that, in the early days of Herod the Great, a section of the scribes had attached themselves to his policy and party, and in doing so had laid aside the sombre raiment of their order, and had appeared in the gorgeous raiment worn by Herod's other courtiers. "We may trace," adds the dean, "with very little hesitation, a vindictive retaliation for these very words in the 'gorgeous robe' with which Herod arrayed him in mockery, when the tetrarch and Christ stood for one brief hour face to face with each other" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Gorgeously apparelled (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>Lit., in splendid clothing.<p>Live delicately (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., are in luxury.
