For one who had journeyed to a feast under the burning sun of Syria, it brought with it a sense of comfort and refreshment which made it a, fit type of spiritual realities. For the usage, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm" title="You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm" title="You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Psalm 45:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm" title="Let your garments be always white; and let your head lack no ointment.">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>. Partly because the use of oil or chrism became more directly symbolic in the ritual of the Christian Church—as in baptism, confirmation, extreme unction, the coronation of kings—partly because in other climates its necessity was not felt, the practice, as belonging to common life, has dropped into disuse. Note the contrast between the olive “oil,” which was commonly used, and the more costly “ointment.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:36-50 None can truly perceive how precious Christ is, and the glory of the gospel, except the broken-hearted. But while they feel they cannot enough express self-abhorrence on account of sin, and admiration of his mercy, the self-sufficient will be disgusted, because the gospel encourages such repenting sinners. The Pharisee, instead of rejoicing in the tokens of the woman's repentance, confined his thoughts to her former bad character. But without free forgiveness none of us can escape the wrath to come; this our gracious Saviour has purchased with his blood, that he may freely bestow it on every one that believes in him. Christ, by a parable, forced Simon to acknowledge that the greater sinner this woman had been, the greater love she ought to show to Him when her sins were pardoned. Learn here, that sin is a debt; and all are sinners, are debtors to Almighty God. Some sinners are greater debtors; but whether our debt be more or less, it is more than we are able to pay. God is ready to forgive; and his Son having purchased pardon for those who believe in him, his gospel promises it to them, and his Spirit seals it to repenting sinners, and gives them the comfort. Let us keep far from the proud spirit of the Pharisee, simply depending upon and rejoicing in Christ alone, and so be prepared to obey him more zealously, and more strongly to recommend him unto all around us. The more we express our sorrow for sin, and our love to Christ, the clearer evidence we have of the forgiveness of our sins. What a wonderful change does grace make upon a sinner's heart and life, as well as upon his state before God, by the full remission of all his sins through faith in the Lord Jesus!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My head with oil - The custom of pouring oil upon the head was universal among the Jews. The oil used was sweet oil or oil of olives, prepared in such a way as to give an agreeable smell. It was also used to render the hair more smooth and elegant. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-3.htm">Ruth 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-20.htm">2 Samuel 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>.<p>With ointment - This "ointment" was a mixture of various aromatics, and was therefore far more costly and precious than the "oil" commonly used for anointing the head. Her conduct, compared with that of Simon, was therefore more striking. "He" did not give even the common oil "for his head" used on such occasions. "She" had applied to "his feet" a far more precious and valuable "unguent." "He" therefore, showed comparatively "little" love. "She" showed "much." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>46. with oil &#8230; not anoint&#8212;even common olive oil in contrast with the woman's "ointment" or aromatic balsam. What evidence was thus afforded of any feeling which forgiveness prompts? Our Lord speaks this with delicate politeness, as if hurt at these inattentions of His host, which though not invariably shown to guests, were the customary marks of studied respect and regard. The inference is plain&#8212;only one of the debtors was really forgiven, though in the first instance, to give room for the play of withheld feelings, the forgiveness of both is supposed in the parable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-40.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to you.

There is, throughout the whole account, an opposition between the conduct of Simon, and this woman: he gave him no common water to wash his feet with, she shed floods of tears, and with them bathed his feet, and then wiped them clean with the hairs of her head; he gave him not the usual salutation by kissing his head or lips, but she kissed his feet, and that over and over again; he did not so much as anoint his head with common oil, when she anointed his feet with costly ointment brought in an alabaster box. These several ceremonies to guests were used by their hosts, in other nations, such as washing, anointing, and kissing (c). <p>(c) Vid.

Here it is only mentioned to contrast it with the still higher honour of which the sinful woman had thought Him worthy.

"It never entered thy thoughts to pay me the homage - and yet I had helped thee, too, a little - of pouring oil on my head" (this was by no means an unusual mark of respect in the case of an honoured guest; to one who, under the burning sun of Palestine, had walked, perhaps, some distance, this pouring oil over the head was a great comfort and refreshment); "but <span class="accented">she</span> hath anointed, not my head, she shrank, poor soul! from doing this; but my feet. And, too, it was no common oil which she used, but precious, fragrant ointment. A cold, loveless welcome, indeed, my Pharisee friend, was thine! Thou thinkest it honour enough the mere admitting the carpenter's Son to thy table; no need of these special tokens of friendship for thy Guest - the water for the feet, the kiss for the face, the oil for the head. It were a pity, surely, for the great world at Jerusalem to look on thee as the friend of the Nazareth Teacher, as on the one Pharisee who loved to honour the Galilaean Reformer." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Oil (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-38.htm">Luke 7:38</a>, the word &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, liquid ointment, is used.

She hath anointed my feet with costly ointment. </body></html>
