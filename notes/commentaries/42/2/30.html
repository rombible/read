Those who would see Christ must go to his temple. Here is a confession of his faith, that this Child in his arms was the Saviour, the salvation itself, the salvation of God's appointing. He bids farewell to this world. How poor does this world look to one that has Christ in his arms, and salvation in his view! See here, how comfortable is the death of a good man; he departs in peace with God, peace with his own conscience, in peace with death. Those that have welcomed Christ, may welcome death. Joseph and Mary marvelled at the things which were spoken of this Child. Simeon shows them likewise, what reason they had to rejoice with trembling. And Jesus, his doctrine, and people, are still spoken against; his truth and holiness are still denied and blasphemed; his preached word is still the touchstone of men's characters. The secret good affections in the minds of some, will be revealed by their embracing Christ; the secret corruptions of others will be revealed by their enmity to Christ. Men will be judged by the thoughts of their hearts concerning Christ. He shall be a suffering Jesus; his mother shall suffer with him, because of the nearness of her relation and affection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy salvation - Him who is to procure salvation for his people; or, the Saviour. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. seen thy salvation&#8212;Many saw this child, nay, the full-grown "man, Christ Jesus," who never saw in Him "God's Salvation."

The Messiah, who is often so called; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-18.htm">Genesis 49:18</a>. He goes by the name of "salvation", because the salvation of God's elect is put into his hands, and he has undertook it; and because he is the author of it, he has fulfilled his engagements, and has accomplished what he promised to do; and because salvation is in him, it is to be had in him; and in him the true Israel of God are saved, with an everlasting salvation: and he is called "God's salvation" because he is a Saviour of his choosing, calling, and constituting; whom he promised under the Old Testament dispensation and in the fulness of time sent; and who now appeared in human nature, and whom good old Simeon now saw, with his bodily eyes; a sight which many kings and prophets had desired, but were not favoured with; and also with the eyes of his understanding, with the spiritual eye of faith, as his Saviour and Redeemer; for without this, the former would not have been sufficient to have given such peace and tranquillity of mind, in a departure out of this world: for many saw him in the days of his flesh, who never saw his glory, as the Son of God, and Saviour of sinners; but such a sight those have, who have their understandings enlightened, and Christ, as God's salvation, set before them: they see him in the glory of his person, the fulness of his grace, the suitableness and excellency of his righteousness, the efficacy of his blood, and the perfection of his sacrifice; and as an able, willing, complete, and only Saviour: and such a sight of him, puts them out of conceit with themselves, and their own works of righteousness, as saviours; makes the creature, and all it has and does, look mean and empty; fills the soul with love to Christ, and a high esteem of him, and with joy unspeakable, and full of glory; it transforms a soul, and makes it like to Christ; gives it inexpressible pleasure and satisfaction; and makes it desirous, as it did this good man, to depart and be with Christ, which is far better than to live in this (in some sense) state of absence from him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> mine eyes have seen thy <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> salvation,</span><p>(n) That is, for I have seen with my very eyes: for he saw before in mind, as it is said of Abraham, He saw my day and rejoiced.<p>(o) That in which your salvation is contained.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-30.htm" title="For my eyes have seen your salvation,">Luke 2:30</a> gives the reason for this tranquil attitude towards death.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ σωτήριον</span> = <span class="greekheb">τὴν σωτηρίαν</span>, often in Sept[29] [29] Septuagint.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="ital">thy salvation</span>] Not <span class="greekheb">τὴν σωτηρίαν</span> but <span class="greekheb">τὸ σωτήριον</span> which seems to have a wider meaning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-30.htm" title="For my eyes have seen your salvation,">Luke 2:30</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἶδον</span>, <span class="ital">have seen</span>) Even his hands held Him: but Simeon adapts his words to those of the promise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-26.htm" title="And it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.">Luke 2:26</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ σωτήριόν σου</span>, <span class="ital">means of salvation</span>) So ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-6.htm" title="And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.">Luke 3:6</a>.
