Those who would see Christ must go to his temple. Here is a confession of his faith, that this Child in his arms was the Saviour, the salvation itself, the salvation of God's appointing. He bids farewell to this world. How poor does this world look to one that has Christ in his arms, and salvation in his view! See here, how comfortable is the death of a good man; he departs in peace with God, peace with his own conscience, in peace with death. Those that have welcomed Christ, may welcome death. Joseph and Mary marvelled at the things which were spoken of this Child. Simeon shows them likewise, what reason they had to rejoice with trembling. And Jesus, his doctrine, and people, are still spoken against; his truth and holiness are still denied and blasphemed; his preached word is still the touchstone of men's characters. The secret good affections in the minds of some, will be revealed by their embracing Christ; the secret corruptions of others will be revealed by their enmity to Christ. Men will be judged by the thoughts of their hearts concerning Christ. He shall be a suffering Jesus; his mother shall suffer with him, because of the nearness of her relation and affection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before the face of all people - Whom thou hast provided for all people, or whom thou dost design to "reveal" to all people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31, 32. all people&#8212;all the peoples, mankind at large.<p>a light to the Gentiles&#8212;then in thick darkness.<p>glory of thy people Israel&#8212;already Thine, and now, in the believing portion of it, to be so more gloriously than ever.

Men like Isaiah, who lived several centuries before the nativity, with their glorious farreaching prophecies, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>, were far in advance of the narrow, selfish Jewish schools of the age of Jesus Christ.
