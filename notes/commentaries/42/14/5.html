Here, as there, the outward features of Jewish life are the same as they had been in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm" title="You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.">Exodus 20:17</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm" title="The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know, my people does not consider.">Isaiah 1:3</a>. The “ox and the ass” are the beasts which common men use and value. The horse belongs to conquerors and kings. This is said with reference to the received text. Many of the best MSS., however, read, “Which of you shall have a <span class= "ital">son,</span> or an ox . . .?” and, on the whole, this reading seems likely to be the true one. The familiar combination of the ox and the ass would naturally lead a transcriber to substitute <span class= "greekheb">ῠνος</span> (ass) for <span class= "greekheb">ὑιός </span>(son). There would be nothing to tempt any one to a change in the opposite direction.<p><span class= "bld">Fallen into a pit.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">into a well,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-6.htm" title="Now Jacob's well was there.

Food might be let down to the ox or ass, but no effort to pull him out was to be made till the Sabbath rest was over.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/14-5.htm" title="And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?...">Luke 14:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">And answered them </span>— Accordingly, while the Pharisees were considering with themselves how to turn the miracle against him, he disconcerted them by proving the lawfulness of what he had done from their own practice. <span class="ital">Which of you shall have an ass, &c., fallen into a pit on the sabbath day </span>— Will you, for fear of breaking the sabbath, let it pass before ye attempt to draw the beast out? and not rather make all the haste you can to save its life, though it should cost you a great deal of work? But the labour of this cure was barely that Jesus laid his hand on the man. His argument, therefore, was what the grossest stupidity could not overlook, nor the most virulent malice contradict. Our Lord had used the same reasoning before, almost in the same words, when vindicating the cure of the man whose hand was withered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-14.htm" title="Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him.">Matthew 12:14</a>; and at another time had urged an argument in effect the same, with regard to the cure of the crooked woman, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-15.htm" title="The Lord then answered him, and said, You hypocrite, does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?">Luke 13:15</a>. Which may serve, among a variety of other instances, to vindicate several repetitions which must be supposed, if we desire to assert the exact and circumstantial truth of the sacred historians. <span class="ital">And they could not answer him again </span>— What he said was so consonant to common sense, and common practice, that they had not a word to reply. They were much ashamed, therefore, and vexed at their disappointment, having gathered themselves together, and invited him in with a design to insnare him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-6 This Pharisee, as well as others, seems to have had an ill design in entertaining Jesus at his house. But our Lord would not be hindered from healing a man, though he knew a clamour would be raised at his doing it on the sabbath. It requires care to understand the proper connexion between piety and charity in observing the sabbath, and the distinction between works of real necessity and habits of self-indulgence.

When however it is a question between two readings it is an almost invariable rule that <span class="ital">the more difficult</span> is to be preferred as the more likely to have been tampered with. Further (i) Scripture never has “ass and ox” but always “ox and ass and (ii) “son” is a probable allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm" title="Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest: that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.">Exodus 23:12</a>, “thine ox and thine ass and the <span class="ital">son</span> of thine handmaid shall rest on the sabbath,” and (iii) the collocation ‘son and ox’ is actually found in some Rabbinic parallels. If it be said that ‘a son falling into a well’ is an unusual incident, the answer seems to be that it <span class="ital">may</span> be an allusion to the man’s disease (dropsy=the <span class="ital">watery</span> disease); also that pits and wells are so common and often so unprotected in Palestine that the incident must have been less rare than it is among us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">straightway pull him out</span>] although the Sabbath labour thus involved would be considerable. And why would they do this? because they had been taught, and in their better mind distinctly felt, that mercy was above the ceremonial law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-4.htm" title="You shall not see your brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely help him to lift them up again.">Deuteronomy 22:4</a>). An instance which had happened not <span class="ital">many</span> years before shews how completely they were blinding and stultifying their own better instincts in their Sabbath quibblings against our Lord. When Hillel—then a poor porter—had been found half-frozen under masses of snow in the window of the lecture-room of Shemaiah and Abtalion where he had hidden himself to profit by their wisdom because he had been unable to earn the small fee for entrance, they had rubbed and resuscitated him <span class="ital">though it was the Sabbath day</span>, and had said that he was one for whose sake it was well worth while to break the Sabbath.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-5.htm" title="And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?">Luke 14:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀνασπάσει</span>, <span class="ital">will pull out</span>) with much toil.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/luke/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And answered them, saying,</span>  <span class="cmt_word">Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?</span> Most of the older authorities here, instead of" an ass or an ox," read "a son or an ox." The difference here in the reading without doubt arises from the perplexity which was felt in very early days over the strangeness of the collocation of "a son and an ox." This is the reading, however, which, according to all the acknowledged principles of criticism, we must consider the true one. The meaning is clear. "If thy son, or even, to take a very different comparison, thy ox, were to fall into a pit, wouldn't you," etc.? How the sophistries of the scribes and the perplexing traditions of the Jerusalem rabbis on their sabbath restrictions must have been torn asunder by the act of mercy and power performed, and the words of Divine wisdom spoken by the Physician-Teacher of Galilee! The noble instincts even of the jealous Pharisees must have been for a moment stirred. Even they, at times, rose above the dreary, lightless teaching with which the rabbinical schools had so marred the old Divine Law. Dr. Farrar quotes a traditional instance of this. "When Hillel"  - afterwards the great rabbi and head of the famous school which bore his name - "then a poor porter, had been found half-frozen under masses of snow in the window of the lecture-room of Shemaiah and Abtation, where he had hidden himself, to profit by their wisdom, because he had been unable to earn the small fee for entrance, they had rubbed and resuscitated him, <span class="accented">though it was the sabbath day</span>, and had said that he was one for whose sake it was well worth while to break the sabbath." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Pit (&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;)<p>The primary meaning is a well as distinguished from a fountain.<p>Pull out<p>More correctly up (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;). </body></html>
