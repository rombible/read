He has all men's hearts both under his eye and in his hand. Christ's triumphs, and his disciples' joyful praises, vex proud Pharisees, who are enemies to him and to his kingdom. But Christ, as he despises the contempt of the proud, so he accepts the praises of the humble. Pharisees would silence the praises of Christ, but they cannot; for as God can out of stones raise up children unto Abraham, and turn the stony heart to himself, so he can bring praise out of the mouths of children.

The ass in the East is not a despised animal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-14.htm" title="Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:">Genesis 49:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-3.htm" title="And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.">Genesis 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-10.htm" title="Speak, you that ride on white asses, you that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.">Jdg 5:10</a>), and it is only because it was despised by Gentiles that Josephus substitutes for it ‘horse’ or ‘beast of burden,’ and the Seventy (LXX.) soften it down into ‘foal,’ &c. The Gentile world abounded in sneers against this narrative, and had all sorts of absurd stories about the Jews and the ass, or ass’s head, which they were supposed to worship (Jos. <span class="ital">e. Ap.</span> ii. 10; Tac. <span class="ital">Hist.</span> v. 3. 4). The Christians were also called ass-worshippers (Tert. <span class="ital">Apol.</span> 16; Minuc.
