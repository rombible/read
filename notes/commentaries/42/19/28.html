The words indicate the same mode of journeying as that which we have traced before—the Master going on in advance, and the disciples following. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-1.htm" title="And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,">Luke 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-32.htm" title="And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen to him,">Mark 10:32</a>.)<p>The journey from Jericho to Jerusalem was literally an ascent all the way (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-30.htm" title="And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.">Luke 10:30</a>), and in this sense, as well as following the language common to most nations, in speaking of their capitals, the verb might well be used. The English word “ascend,” however, is not used elsewhere in the New Testament of any earthly journeys.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/19-28.htm" title="And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem....">Luke 19:28-40</a></span>. <span class="ital">When he had thus spoken </span>— When he had finished the preceding parable in Zaccheus’s house; <span class="ital">he went before </span>— Continued his journey, and led the way as foremost of the company, thus showing his readiness to suffer; <span class="ital">ascending up to Jerusalem </span>— Being determined to appear there at the approaching passover, though he well knew that he was to encounter persecution and death there. <span class="ital">And when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany </span>— Both these villages being situated at the foot of the mount of Olives, and Jesus being between them, on the road from Jericho to Jerusalem, he might very properly be said to have been nigh to both, and nigh to Jerusalem, which was at the distance of two miles only: <span class="ital">he sent two of his disciples, </span>&c. — See this paragraph explained, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/21-1.htm" title="And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,...">Matthew 21:1-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/11-1.htm" title="And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples,...">Mark 11:1-10</a>. <span class="ital">The whole multitude began to praise God — </span>Speaking at once, as it seems, from a divine impulse words which most of them did not understand. <span class="ital">Peace in heaven </span>— God being reconciled to man. <span class="ital">Rebuke thy disciples </span>— Paying thee this immoderate honour. <span class="ital">If these should hold their peace, the stones </span>which lie before you <span class="ital">would immediately cry out — </span>That is, God would raise up some still more unlikely instruments to declare his praise. Or, that he would, by a miracle, raise up others to glorify his name, rather than silence should be kept on this occasion. But though Jesus did not refuse the honours that were now paid him, he was far from assuming the dignity of an earthly prince, or any state pageantry whatsoever. On the contrary, he humbled himself exceedingly; his riding on an ass being an instance of great meekness, according to what was prophesied of him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:28-40 Christ has dominion over all creatures, and may use them as he pleases. He has all men's hearts both under his eye and in his hand. Christ's triumphs, and his disciples' joyful praises, vex proud Pharisees, who are enemies to him and to his kingdom. But Christ, as he despises the contempt of the proud, so he accepts the praises of the humble. Pharisees would silence the praises of Christ, but they cannot; for as God can out of stones raise up children unto Abraham, and turn the stony heart to himself, so he can bring praise out of the mouths of children.

St. Luke here passes over in silence the events which happened after the episode at the house of Zacchaeus at Jericho and the speaking the great parable of "the pounds." This parable may have been spoken in the house of Zacchaeus before leaving Jericho, but it seems better to place it somewhere in the course of the walk from Jericho to Bethany, a distance of some twelve miles. St. John fills up the gap left in the narrative of St. Luke. The main body of pilgrims to the feast, with whom Jesus and his company were travelling, left him on the Jericho road at Bethany: they going on to their caravanserai in the holy city, he remaining for two nights with his friends at Bethany - the next evening Jesus was entertained at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-3.htm">Mark 14:3-9</a>) - the feast at which Lazarus the risen sat a guest and Martha served, and to which Mary brought her precious ointment and her contrition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-1.htm">John 11:1-9</a>). Jesus must have arrived at Bethany before sunset on Friday, Nisan 7, and therefore before the sabbath began. The sabbath was spent in quiet. The supper probably took place directly after the end of the sabbath. The next morning (Palm Sunday)the Lord started for Jerusalem, and entered the holy city in the triumphant way as King Messiah related by St. Luke in our Gospel. </body></html>
