He has all men's hearts both under his eye and in his hand. Christ's triumphs, and his disciples' joyful praises, vex proud Pharisees, who are enemies to him and to his kingdom. But Christ, as he despises the contempt of the proud, so he accepts the praises of the humble. Pharisees would silence the praises of Christ, but they cannot; for as God can out of stones raise up children unto Abraham, and turn the stony heart to himself, so he can bring praise out of the mouths of children.

What village this was, is not said by any of the evangelists; it seems to be either Bethany, or Nob; and rather the latter, since the village of Bethany was fifteen furlongs, or near two miles from Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-18.htm">John 11:18</a> and therefore must have been passed by Christ; whereas the tract called Bethany, at the Mount of Olives where Christ now was, was but a sabbath day's journey, or about a mile, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>.

The account of this transaction is less circumstantial in St. Luke than in the other evangelists. The reference to the prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> is here left out. This prophecy is, however, necessary for the full understanding of the mystic act of riding upon an ass's colt. St. Luke, compiling especially for Gentile readers, would feel that such a reference to the old Hebrew story would scarcely interest a foreigner, and would serve to distract such a one's interest in the progress of the great recital. For us, however, the meaning of the scene, read in the light of the <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> words and of Hebrew story generally, is as follows: The disciples and multitude wished their Master to claim a kingdom. At this moment in his eventful history, aware that death awaited him in the course of the next few days, he chose to gratify them; so he claimed his kingdom, but a kingdom utterly unlike what <span class="accented">they</span> longed for. He came to his royal, sacred city in the strange guise foreshadowed by Zechariah, as a Prince of Peace, not with chariot and horse, but meekly riding on an ass's colt, claiming, too, a dominion from sea to sea, from the river to the ends of the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a>). <span class="accented">Whereon yet never man sat.</span> For this reason specially adapted for a sacred use (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7</a>). </body></html>
