In details we note (1) that St. Luke unites the “Bethphage” of St. Matthew with the “Bethany” of St. Mark; (2) that, as a stranger to Judæa, he speaks of the “mountain <span class= "ital">that was called</span> the Mount of Olives.

The absence of the article before the Greek for “Olives,” and the accentuation of the words in many MSS., seem decisive in favour of this view.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:28-40 Christ has dominion over all creatures, and may use them as he pleases. He has all men's hearts both under his eye and in his hand. Christ's triumphs, and his disciples' joyful praises, vex proud Pharisees, who are enemies to him and to his kingdom. But Christ, as he despises the contempt of the proud, so he accepts the praises of the humble. Pharisees would silence the praises of Christ, but they cannot; for as God can out of stones raise up children unto Abraham, and turn the stony heart to himself, so he can bring praise out of the mouths of children.

Following Lightfoot and Renan, Godet regards this as the name not of a village but of a suburban district included for passover purposes in the holy city, pilgrims to the feast finding quarters in it.

Jesus arrived at Bethany before sunset on Friday, Nisan 8 (March 31, A. D<span class="bld">. </span>30), and therefore before the Sabbath began. Here the throng of Galilaean pilgrims would leave Him to go to their friends in Jerusalem, or to make booths for themselves in the valley of the Kidron and on the slopes of Olivet. The Sabbath was spent in quiet. The supper was in the evening, otherwise the Jews could not have come from Jerusalem, as the distance exceeded a Sabbath day’s journey. It was on the next morning (Palm Sunday) that our Lord started for Jerusalem. His stay at Bethany may have been due to friendship, or may have been dictated by prudence. It was the brooding over the imagined loss of the value of the precious ointment —an assault of Satan at the weakest point—which first drove Judas to his secret interview with the Sadducean priests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">two of his disciples</span>] The minute touch of description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-4.htm" title="And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.">Mark 11:4</a> has led to the conjecture that Peter was one of these two.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/19.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,">Luke 19:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὡς</span>, <span class="ital">as</span>) [when].
