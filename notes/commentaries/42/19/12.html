There are, however, many noticeable differences in detail. At the outset we have the new feature of the nobleman going “into a far country to receive a kingdom.” This had an obvious starting-point in the recent history of Judæa. Both the Tetrarch Antipas and Archelaus, on the death of their father, had gone to Rome to submit their claims to the kingdom to the decision of Augustus (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xvii. 9, §§ 3, 4). The Greek for “nobleman” is not the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-46.htm" title="So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.">John 4:46</a>, where the word means a “king’s officer.” Here it is simply a “man of noble family.” In the interpretation of the parable we may see a prophetic announcement by our Lord of His own departure to the “far country,” that lay behind the veil, to receive His Kingdom, and of His subsequent return.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/luke/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-12.htm" title="He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.">Luke 19:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">A certain nobleman </span>— Or, a certain king’s son; <span class="ital">went into a far country to receive a kingdom, </span>&c. — In order to be confirmed in his father’s kingdom, he went into a distant country to do homage unto a more powerful potentate, of whom he held it as a vassal. There is supposed to be an allusion here to a custom which prevailed greatly in our Lord’s time among the princes of the East; who, before they ventured to ascend the throne, went to Rome, and solicited the emperor’s permission, who disposed of all the tributary kingdoms as he saw fit. Dr. Campbell, instead of, <span class="ital">to receive a kingdom, </span>reads, <span class="ital">to procure for himself royalty, </span>observing, “To me it is manifest, that <span class="greekheb">βασιλεια</span>, here, signifies <span class="ital">royalty, </span>that is, royal power and dignity. For that it was not a different kingdom from that wherein he lived, as the common version implies, is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-14.htm" title="But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.">Luke 19:14</a>. It is equally so, that there is in this circumstance an allusion to what was well known to Christ’s hearers, the way in which Archelaus, and even Herod himself, had obtained their rank and authority in Judea, by favour of the Romans. When this reference to the history of the times is kept in view, and <span class="greekheb">βασιλεια </span>understood to denote royal power and dignity, there is not the shadow of a difficulty in the story. In any other explanation, the expounder, in order to remove inconsistencies, is obliged to suppose so many circumstances not related, or even hinted at by the evangelist, that the latter is, to say the least, made to appear a very inaccurate narrator.” Whichever interpretation be adopted, the meaning of this part of the parable evidently is, that before Jesus entered upon his mediatorial kingdom, and sat down at the right hand of God in majesty and glory, it was necessary he should die and ascend to heaven; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross....">Php 2:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-8.htm" title="But to the Son he said, Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom....">Hebrews 1:8-9</a>; from whence he was afterward to return, as it were, that is, to come forth in his justice and power, to punish, first, the unbelieving and obstinate Jews, and afterward, in future ages, the opposers of his gospel, the persecutors of his people, all antichristian powers, and, at the day of final judgment, all the impenitent and unbelieving.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:11-27 This parable is like that of the talents, Mt 25. Those that are called to Christ, he furnishes with gifts needful for their business; and from those to whom he gives power, he expects service. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal, 1Co 12:7. And as every one has received the gift, so let him minister the same, 1Pe 4:10. The account required, resembles that in the parable of the talents; and the punishment of the avowed enemies of Christ, as well as of false professors, is shown. The principal difference is, that the pound given to each seems to point out the gift of the gospel, which is the same to all who hear it; but the talents, distributed more or less, seem to mean that God gives different capacities and advantages to men, by which this one gift of the gospel may be differently improved.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A certain nobleman - A prince; a man descended from kings, and having a title, therefore, to succeed in the kingdom.<p>Went into a far country ... - This expression is derived from the state of things in Judea in the time of the Saviour. Judea was subject to the Romans, having been conquered by Pompey about sixty years before Christ. It was, however, governed by "Jews," who held the government "under" the Romans. It was necessary that the prince or king should receive a recognition of his right to the kingdom by the Roman emperor and, in order to this, that he should go to Rome; or, as it is said here, that he might receive to himself a kingdom. This actually occurred several times. Archelaus, a son of Herod the Great, about the time of the birth of Jesus, went to Rome to obtain a confirmation of the title which his father had left him, and succeeded in doing it. Herod the Great, his father, had done the same thing before to secure the aid and countenance of Antony. Agrippa the younger, grandson of Herod the Great, went to Rome also to obtain the favor of Tiberius, and to be confirmed in his government. Such instances, having frequently occurred, would make this parable perfectly intelligible to those to whom it was addressed. By the nobleman, here, is undoubtedly represented the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ; by his going into a far country is denoted his going to heaven, to the right hand of his Father, "before" he should "fully" set up his kingdom and establish his reign among men. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. a far country&#8212;said to put down the notion that He was just on His way to set up His kingdom, and to inaugurate it by His personal presence.<p>to receive &#8230; a kingdom&#8212;be invested with royalty; as when Herod went to Rome and was there made king; a striking expression of what our Lord went away for and received, "sitting down at the right hand of the Majesty on high."<p>to return&#8212;at His second coming.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 12-27. The parable of the talents, which we had, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/25-14.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods....">Matthew 25:14-30</a></span>, is of great cognation to this parable, and the doctrine of it in many things is the very same; but the circumstances of that and this relation are so differing, as I cannot think that both Matthew and Luke relate to the same time. I know nothing that hinders, but that our Saviour might twice repeat a parable which in substance is the same. Not to insist upon the examination of the words used in the Greek, (which is a work fit only for critical writers), for the right understanding of this parable we have three things to do: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. To inquire what special instruction our Saviour did in this parable intend to those who heard him at that time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Who the persons are, represented in it under the notion of a nobleman and servants; and what the things are, represented under the notion of going into a far country, to receive a kingdom, distributing his goods, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. What general instructions from it may be collected, which inform us as well as those to whom our Lord at that time spake. The special instructions which our Lord in this parable seemeth by it to have given his disciples were these: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>a) That they were mistaken in their notions or apprehensions of the sudden coming of Christ’s kingdom in power and glory. He had first a great journey to go, and they had a great deal of work to do. Instead of reigning amongst them, and exalting them, he was going away from them for a long time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>b) That there would be such a manifestation of his kingdom in glory and power, when he should exalt and liberally reward his friends, and severely punish all such as should be his enemies. In order to these instructions, he taketh up this parable, or speaketh to them in the use of this similitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>c) As to the aptness of it: The <span class="ital">nobleman</span> here mentioned was Christ, who shall hereafter be a King in the exercise of power and justice, and distribute eternal rewards and punishments; but in his state of humiliation in which he was when he thus spake to them, was but like a nobleman, a Son of man, though the chiefest of ten thousand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>His going <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">into afar country, </span> signifieth his going from earth to heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To receive a kingdom; </span> a kingdom of glory, honour, and power at the right hand of the Father. His returning signifies his coming again to judge the world at the last day. His calling his servants, and delivering to them ten pounds, signifieth his giving gifts unto men, when he should ascend up on high; gifts of several natures, but all to be occupied, used in a spiritual trade, for the advantage of our common Lord. Not that he giveth to all alike, (which it is manifest he doth not), for every passage in a parable is not answered in the thing which it is brought to represent or express. The citizens hating him, and sending a message after him, &c., signifies that the generality of the world are haters of Christ, and demonstrate their hatred by their refusal of his spiritual government and jurisdiction. His returning, and calling his servants to an account, signifies, that when Christ at the last day shall come to judge the world, he will have an account of every individual person, how they have used the gifts with which he hath intrusted them, whether they be longer time of life, more health than others, riches, honours, or more spiritual gifts, such as knowledge, utterance, wit, &c., or any trusty places or offices they have been in. The different account the servants brought in, signifies that men do not equally use the gifts with which the Lord blesseth them; some use them well, some ill; some bring honour and glory to God by the use of them, and that some in one degree, and some in another. Some bring him no honour or glory at all. The master’s answer to them upon their accounts, lets us know that every man shall be rewarded according to his work. There will be degrees in glory, (though we cannot well open them), as well as of punishments. The unprofitable servant’s excuse for himself, signifies the great itch of proud human nature to excuse itself, and lay all the blame of its miscarriages on God, either his severity, or his not giving them enough, &c. The king’s answer, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-22.htm" title="And he said to him, Out of your own mouth will I judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow:">Luke 19:22</a>,23</span>, lets us know, that sinners will be found to be condemned out of their own mouths: at the last day, God will be found a righteous God, and man will be found to be the liar. What the Lord further adds, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-24.htm" title="And he said to them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that has ten pounds.">Luke 19:24</a>,26</span>, lets us know God’s liberality in rewarding his saints at last. What he saith <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-27.htm" title="But those my enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay them before me.">Luke 19:27</a></span>, concerning his enemies, assures us, that although God spareth men and women a long time, so long as while his Son is in the far country, while the heavens must contain him; yet in the day of judgment a most certain final ruin will be their portion. Hence we may easily gather what instructions are offered us in this parable. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That the state of Christ, when he shall come to judge the world, will be a far more glorious state than it was while he was here upon the earth. He was here in the appearance of a nobleman, but he shall then appear as a king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That all the good things which we have in this life are our Lord’s goods, put in trust with us to be used for his honour and glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That it must be expected that in the world there should be a great many rebels against Christ and his kingdom, a great many that shall say, <span class="ital">We will not have this man to rule over us.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That some make greater improvements than others of what God intrusts them with for his honour and glory, and some make no improvement at all of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. That Christ, when he cometh to judge the world, will have a strict account how men have used his goods, their time of life, or health, their capacities, honours, riches, trusts, parts, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6. That those shall have the highest reward in glory who have made the highest improvements; but those who have made improvements in any proportion shall have their reward. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>7. That proud and wretched sinners will think in the day of judgment to wipe their own mouths, and lay all the blame of their miscarriages on God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>8. That this is their folly, God will condemn them from their own vain pleas. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>9. That in the day of judgment unprofitable creatures will, besides the loss of those rewards which they might have received from God, have all their little satisfactions taken from them, in the enjoyments of which they dishonoured God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>10. That though proud sinners here oppose the law of God revealed to them, and will not suffer Christ to reign over them; yet his power they shall not be able to resist, they shall at the last day be slain before Christ’s face, and become his footstool. He shall break them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm" title="You shall break them with a rod of iron; you shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.">Psalm 2:9</a> 110:1</span>, and who shall then deliver them out of his hand? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He said therefore,.... The following parable, with the above said design and view: <p>a certain nobleman; the son of a great family, as the Syriac version renders it; of noble descent, of an illustrious extract; by whom is meant Jesus Christ, who was a "man", as he agreed to be, and was prophesied of as such; and who frequently appeared in an human form before his incarnation; and was now actually become man, though not a mere man: and he may truly be said to be "noble"; not only as the word may signify, as it sometimes does, a person of great authority and power, and of great generosity and goodness, but one of a noble birth; for Christ, as man, descended from the kings of the house of Judah, and was the son of David; and from the Jewish fathers and ancestors of the greatest renown, as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and he may be so called as man, because of the union of the human nature to the Son of God; or because of his divine relation, as the Son of God: this illustrious person, <p>went into a far country; by which, heaven is meant; so called, not only because of its distance from the earth, but in comparison of the earth, as a place of pilgrimage; and because that it is out of sight, and the views which are had of it, are very distant ones: hither Christ went at his ascension; he came from heaven at his incarnation, by the assumption of human nature; he stayed here awhile, till he had done his work he came about, and then went up to heaven; where he is received, and from whence he is expected again: the end of his going there is, <p>to receive for himself a kingdom: by which is intended, not the kingdom of nature and providence; for that he had, and did not receive from another; it was his of right, and by nature; nor the kingdom of grace, set up in the hearts of his people, and which was already within many of them; nor the kingdom of glory, prepared for them from the foundation of the world; though into this he entered at his ascension, and took possession of it for himself and them: but a more visible display of his mediatorial kingdom, he received from his Father; and which, upon his ascension, became more manifest, by the dispossessing of Satan, and casting him out of the Gentile world; by converting large numbers of his people, both among Jews and Gentiles; and by ruling in their hearts, subduing their enemies, and protecting and defending them; and by thus reigning till he has gathered them all in, either in Judea, or in the whole world, and then he will come again: <p>and return; either to destroy the Jews; the doing of which fully proved he had received his kingdom, was vested with power and authority, and was made, or declared Lord and Christ; or at the end of the world, to judge both quick and dead: and this is said, to show that his personal glorious kingdom on earth, or his kingdom in its greatest glory here, will not be till he comes a second time; and to engage diligence in his servants in the mean while; and to keep up the faith, hope, and expectation of his coming again. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/luke/19.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/19-12.htm" title="He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return....">Luke 19:12-13</a>.

The Evangelists throw no gleam of light upon it, and the fact that we can from contemporary secular history not only explain it, but even trace (without the slightest aid from any of the Gospels) the exact circumstances <span class="ital">which suggested it at this very place and time</span>, is one of the many invaluable independent circumstances which enable us to prove from history the absolute truthfulness of these records. Two ‘nobles’—Herod the Great and his son Archelaus—had actually gone from Jericho to a far country, even to Rome, for the express purpose of ‘receiving a kingdom’ from the all-powerful Caesar (Jos. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xiv. 14, xvii. 9, §4: comp. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/8-13.htm" title="Also that, whom they would help to a kingdom, those reign; and whom again they would, they displace: finally, that they were greatly exalted:">1Ma 8:13</a>), and the same thing was subsequently done by Antipas (id. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xviii. 5, § 1). It is deeply interesting to see how Jesus thus utilises any incident—social or political—as a vehicle for spiritual instruction. Probably if we knew the events of His day more minutely, we should see the origin of many others of the parables. The facts here alluded to would naturally be brought both to His mind, and to those of the Galilaeans, by the sight of the magnificent palace at Jericho which Archelaus had rebuilt. (Jos. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xvii. 13, § 1.) How little the incidental machinery of parables should be theologically pressed, we may see from the fact that here our Lord takes the movements and the actions of a cruel and bad prince like Archelaus, to shadow forth certain truths of His own ministry (compare the Parables of the Unjust Steward and the Unjust Judge).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/19.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-12.htm" title="He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.">Luke 19:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εὐγενὴς</span>, <span class="ital">noble</span>) Truly the <span class="ital">nobility</span> of Jesus was the highest nobility of all.

There was a singular fitness in the Master's choice of a framework for his parable, which at first sight would seem strange and unreal. Two nobles, Herod and Archelaus, in that age had literally gone from Jericho, where the Speaker of the parable-story then was, to a far country across the sea - to Rome, to receive a kingdom from Caesar (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:14; 17:9). And one of these two nobles, Archelaus, had rebuilt the stately royal palace of Jericho, under the very shadow of which the Speaker and the crowds were perhaps standing. </body></html>
