He has all men's hearts both under his eye and in his hand. Christ's triumphs, and his disciples' joyful praises, vex proud Pharisees, who are enemies to him and to his kingdom. But Christ, as he despises the contempt of the proud, so he accepts the praises of the humble. Pharisees would silence the praises of Christ, but they cannot; for as God can out of stones raise up children unto Abraham, and turn the stony heart to himself, so he can bring praise out of the mouths of children.

The Syriac and Persic versions read "our Lord", yours, and ours; probably the owners of the colt might be such as knew the Lord Jesus Christ, and by this way of speaking of him, knew, at once, who was meant, and so made no scruple of sending him, as Christ told them they would not, and so they found it; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21</a>:3 and  See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3</a> <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/19.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/19-31.htm" title="And if any man ask you, Why do you loose him? thus shall you say to him, Because the Lord has need of him....">Luke 19:31-34</a>. The sending of two disciples for the colt is related as in Mt. and Mk., but with a little more of Greek in the style. The remark about the owners sending it (Mt.) or Jesus returning it (Mk.) is omitted. On the other hand, Lk. alone states that the two disciples found matters as the Master had said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-32.htm" title="And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said to them.">Luke 19:32</a>).

Probably the colt, though not broken in, would go the more quietly accompanied by its mother. But the reason of St. Matthew's special mention of the ass as well as of the colt was the reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>, in which Justin Martyr, in a curious chapter of the 'Dialogue with Trypho,' finds a direct reference to the ass and the foal (see Justin Martyr, 'Dialogue with Trypho,' c. 53.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/19.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The Lord<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-3.htm">Matthew 21:3</a>. </body></html>
