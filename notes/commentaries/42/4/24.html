But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.">Matthew 13:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-4.htm" title="But Jesus, said to them, A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.">Mark 6:4</a>). St. John’s reference to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-44.htm" title="For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.">John 4:44</a>) may have risen out of one or other of these two occasions, but it rather conveys the impression of the saying having been often on the lips of Jesus.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:14-30 Christ taught in their synagogues, their places of public worship, where they met to read, expound, and apply the word, to pray and praise. All the gifts and graces of the Spirit were upon him and on him, without measure. By Christ, sinners may be loosed from the bonds of guilt, and by his Spirit and grace from the bondage of corruption. He came by the word of his gospel, to bring light to those that sat in the dark, and by the power of his grace, to give sight to those that were blind. And he preached the acceptable year of the Lord. Let sinners attend to the Saviour's invitation when liberty is thus proclaimed. Christ's name was Wonderful; in nothing was he more so than in the word of his grace, and the power that went along with it. We may well wonder that he should speak such words of grace to such graceless wretches as mankind. Some prejudice often furnishes an objection against the humbling doctrine of the cross; and while it is the word of God that stirs up men's enmity, they will blame the conduct or manner of the speaker. The doctrine of God's sovereignty, his right to do his will, provokes proud men. They will not seek his favour in his own way; and are angry when others have the favours they neglect. Still is Jesus rejected by multitudes who hear the same message from his words. While they crucify him afresh by their sins, may we honour him as the Son of God, the Saviour of men, and seek to show we do so by our obedience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No prophet is accepted - Has honor, or is acknowledged as a prophet.

And he said, &c.&#8212;He replies to the one proverb by another, equally familiar, which we express in a rougher form&#8212;"Too much familiarity breeds contempt." Our Lord's long residence in Nazareth merely as a townsman had made Him too common, incapacitating them for appreciating Him as others did who were less familiar with His everyday demeanor in private life. A most important principle, to which the wise will pay due regard.

But instead of gratifying their curiosity and supplying them with some more empty arguments why they should not listen to his words, the Lord quietly quotes a proverb well known to all people - Farrar calls it a curious psychological fact - the quoting prefaced by the solemn "verily." The Master was evidently looking far beyond the little prejudices of Nazareth. "His own country" meant far more than the narrow circuit bounded by the Nazareth hills. The Speaker was thinking of all the chosen people - of the Jews, who as a nation he knew too well would not accept him. But if Israel would have none of him, he would reign in the hearts of that unnumbered multitude who peopled the isles of the Gentiles. </body></html>
