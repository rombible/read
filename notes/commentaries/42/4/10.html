He who knew his own strength might give Satan advantage; but we may not, who know our own weakness. Being in all things made like unto his brethren, Jesus would, like the other children of God, live in dependence upon the Divine Providence and promise. The word of God is our sword, and faith in that word is our shield. God has many ways of providing for his people, and therefore is at all times to be depended upon in the way of duty. All Satan's promises are deceitful; and if he is permitted to have any influence in disposing of the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, he uses them as baits to insnare men to destruction. We should reject at once and with abhorrence, every opportunity of sinful gain or advancement, as a price offered for our souls; we should seek riches, honours, and happiness in the worship and service of God only. Christ will not worship Satan; nor, when he has the kingdoms of the world delivered to him by his Father, will he suffer any remains of the worship of the devil to continue in them. Satan also tempted Jesus to be his own murderer, by unfitting confidence in his Father's protection, such as he had no warrant for. Let not any abuse of Scripture by Satan or by men abate our esteem, or cause us to abandon its use; but let us study it still, seek to know it, and seek our defence from it in all kinds of assaults. Let this word dwell richly in us, for it is our life. Our victorious Redeemer conquered, not for himself only, but for us also. The devil ended all the temptation. Christ let him try all his force, and defeated him. Satan saw it was to no purpose to attack Christ, who had nothing in him for his fiery darts to fasten upon. And if we resist the devil, he will flee from us. Yet he departed but till the season when he was again to be let loose upon Jesus, not as a tempter, to draw him to sin, and so to strike at his head, at which he now aimed and was wholly defeated in; but as a persecutor, to bring Christ to suffer, and so to bruise his heel, which it was told him, he should have to do, and would do, though it would be the breaking of his own head, Ge 3:15. Though Satan depart for a season, we shall never be out of his reach till removed from this present evil world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Being forty days tempted - That is, through forty days he was "tried" in various ways by the devil.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a> "He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee; and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone." It is an observation made long ago by Jerom, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a> that Satan, in citing this text, has left out the middle clause, <p>to keep thee in all thy ways, which he knew was against him, and has only taken that which made for him; and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-6.htm">Matthew 4:6</a> he observes, that this prophecy is not concerning Christ, but any holy man; therefore the devil wrongly interpreted Scripture; and that had he certainly known, that this is written concerning the Saviour, he ought to have cited what follows, "thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder, the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet": and in these observations, he has been followed by many interpreters; but Surenhusius (i) is not satisfied with them, especially with what respects the manner of citation, leaving out some words, and not mentioning others that follow; since such a way of citing perfectly agrees with the method of the Jewish doctors; who reckon one word of a passage being cited all that follows, if it makes to the purpose, all one as if it was cited, and to be so accounted; and since, if such a method is blame worthy, Christ, the evangelists, and apostles, must be blamed also, seeing they frequently use the same, which can never be allowed of: besides, supposing the clause omitted was added, he asks of what advantage it would be? since the two verses being connected together as they are, the sense with respect to God's providence and preservation, is clear enough and complete: and I must confess, though I have pursued the above observation, in the note on See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-6.htm">Matthew 4:6</a> yet by comparing the evangelists together, it is not a clear case to me, what Satan did leave out, or whether any thing at all; but it seems rather, that the words are put, as the evangelists themselves thought fit to transcribe them, in which they are not exactly alike; more is left out by one, than by another; Matthew leaves out the whole clause, "to keep thee in all thy ways"; but Luke only omits these words, "in all thy ways": but I am still of opinion, that the passage is applicable to Christ, as to any holy good man, yet it appears that Satan failed not, neither in the manner of citing it, nor in the application of it to Christ; but by wresting it to a wicked purpose, to countenance an action unwarrantable and criminal, being a tempting God; when the text only regards the preservation of good men in the way of duty, trusting in the Lord; and which is confirmed by the answer of Christ, who takes no notice of any faulty citation of the passage, or misapplication of it, as to his person; only suggests, by opposing another Scripture to him, that what he had produced, was to a wrong and wicked purpose; and to take it in his sense, would be to tempt God; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-6.htm">Matthew 4:6</a>. <p>(i) Biblos Katallages, p. 210, 211. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/luke/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/luke/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/4-10.htm" title="For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you:...">Luke 4:10-11</a> give Satan’s quotation much as in Mt., with <span class="greekheb">τοῦ διαφυλάξαι σε</span> added from the Psalm.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/luke/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">For it is written</span>]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>An evil soul producing holy witness<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A deadly apple rotten at the heart.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Shakespeare.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“In religion<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What damned error but some sober brow<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Will bless it and approve it with a text,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Id</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to keep thee</span>] The quotation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm" title="For he shall give his angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways.">Psalm 91:11</a>, but the tempter omits “<span class="bld"><span class="ital">in</span> all thy ways<span class="bld"></span></span>,” which would have defeated his object, since the “ways” referred to are only the ways of him “who dwelleth under the defence of the Most High.” But, as the <span class="ital">next</span> verse prophesies, Christ ‘trod upon the lion and adder’ of Satanic temptation.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>To keep (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here in New Testament.
