These miracles showed Christ to be a controller and conqueror of Satan, a healer of diseases. Where Christ gives a new life, in recovery from sickness, it should be a new life, spent more than ever in his service, to his glory. Our business should be to spread abroad Christ's fame in every place, to beseech him in behalf of those diseased in body or mind, and to use our influence in bringing sinners to him, that his hands may be laid upon them for their healing. He cast the devils out of many who were possessed. We were not sent into this world to live to ourselves only, but to glorify God, and to do good in our generation. The people sought him, and came unto him. A desert is no desert, if we are with Christ there. He will continue with us, by his word and Spirit, and extend the same blessings to other nations, till, throughout the earth, the servants and worshippers of Satan are brought to acknowledge him as the Christ, the Son of God, and to find redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-21.htm">Mark 1:21-39</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36.

It is the word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a> of the mighty rushing wind at Pentecost. Mark uses &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#768;, in its earlier sense of a report. The same word occurs in Luke, but always in the sense in which medical writers employed it - hearing or the ears. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-1.htm">Luke 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-20.htm">Acts 17:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-26.htm">Acts 28:26</a>. &#x397;&#787;&#834;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, was the medical term for sound in the ears or head. Hippocrates uses both words together: "the ears (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;) are full of sound (&#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;);" and Aretaeus of the noise of the sea, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>.</body></html>
