(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-9.htm" title="And said to him, All these things will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.">Matthew 4:9</a>.) The notion that any such delegated sovereignty had been assigned to the Tempter, either before or after his fall from his first estate, has, it need hardly be said, no foundation in Scripture. It asserts that “the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-1.htm" title="The earth is the LORD's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.">Psalm 24:1</a>); and the claim of the Tempter was a lying boast, resting only on the permitted activity and temporary predominance of evil in the actual course of the world’s history.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/luke/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-13 Christ's being led into the wilderness gave an advantage to the tempter; for there he was alone, none were with him by whose prayers and advice he might be helped in the hour of temptation. He who knew his own strength might give Satan advantage; but we may not, who know our own weakness. Being in all things made like unto his brethren, Jesus would, like the other children of God, live in dependence upon the Divine Providence and promise. The word of God is our sword, and faith in that word is our shield. God has many ways of providing for his people, and therefore is at all times to be depended upon in the way of duty. All Satan's promises are deceitful; and if he is permitted to have any influence in disposing of the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them, he uses them as baits to insnare men to destruction. We should reject at once and with abhorrence, every opportunity of sinful gain or advancement, as a price offered for our souls; we should seek riches, honours, and happiness in the worship and service of God only. Christ will not worship Satan; nor, when he has the kingdoms of the world delivered to him by his Father, will he suffer any remains of the worship of the devil to continue in them. Satan also tempted Jesus to be his own murderer, by unfitting confidence in his Father's protection, such as he had no warrant for. Let not any abuse of Scripture by Satan or by men abate our esteem, or cause us to abandon its use; but let us study it still, seek to know it, and seek our defence from it in all kinds of assaults. Let this word dwell richly in us, for it is our life. Our victorious Redeemer conquered, not for himself only, but for us also. The devil ended all the temptation. Christ let him try all his force, and defeated him. Satan saw it was to no purpose to attack Christ, who had nothing in him for his fiery darts to fasten upon. And if we resist the devil, he will flee from us. Yet he departed but till the season when he was again to be let loose upon Jesus, not as a tempter, to draw him to sin, and so to strike at his head, at which he now aimed and was wholly defeated in; but as a persecutor, to bring Christ to suffer, and so to bruise his heel, which it was told him, he should have to do, and would do, though it would be the breaking of his own head, Ge 3:15. Though Satan depart for a season, we shall never be out of his reach till removed from this present evil world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Being forty days tempted - That is, through forty days he was "tried" in various ways by the devil.

The Rabbis went even further, and called him ‘Lord of this age’ (<span class="ital">sar hâolâm</span>), and even “another God” (<span class="ital">êl achêr</span>), which is Manicheeism; whereas in this verse, by the very admission of Satan, all Manicheeism is excluded.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to whomsoever I will I give it</span>] Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-2.htm" title="And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.">Revelation 13:2</a>, “the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.” Here however we note the exaggeration of the father of lies. How different was the language of our Lord to His ambitious disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not my to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.">Matthew 20:23</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-6.htm" title="And the devil said to him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.">Luke 4:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὴν ἐξουσίαν ταύτην</span>, <span class="ital">this power</span>) viz. of these kingdoms. It is to the latter that the <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> [the glory] <span class="ital">of them</span>, is to be referred.—<span class="greekheb">παραδέδοται</span>, <span class="ital">is delivered</span>) This assertion is not altogether false. Satan had great power before his fall: and the portion of power which he retains since his fall, he turns to evil account. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm" title="And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brothers is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.">Revelation 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-2.htm" title="And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.">Revelation 13:2</a>. The Tempter confesses that he is not the founder or creator of these kingdoms. Therefore he did not demand the highest degree of adoration or worship; and yet Jesus shows that even an inferior degree of worship cannot be given to any creature, much less to Satan.—<span class="greekheb">δίδωμι</span>, <span class="ital">I give</span>) In this instance he was willing to give the whole: in other cases, he is wont to give to his retainers only in smaller portions. See, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-2.htm" title="And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.">Revelation 13:2</a>.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Note the emphatic position of the pronouns: "To thee will I give - for to me it hath been delivered: thou, therefore, if thou wilt worship," etc. Luke, in his narrative, enlarges upon Matthew.
