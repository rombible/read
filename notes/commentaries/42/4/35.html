These miracles showed Christ to be a controller and conqueror of Satan, a healer of diseases. Where Christ gives a new life, in recovery from sickness, it should be a new life, spent more than ever in his service, to his glory. Our business should be to spread abroad Christ's fame in every place, to beseech him in behalf of those diseased in body or mind, and to use our influence in bringing sinners to him, that his hands may be laid upon them for their healing. He cast the devils out of many who were possessed. We were not sent into this world to live to ourselves only, but to glorify God, and to do good in our generation. The people sought him, and came unto him. A desert is no desert, if we are with Christ there. He will continue with us, by his word and Spirit, and extend the same blessings to other nations, till, throughout the earth, the servants and worshippers of Satan are brought to acknowledge him as the Christ, the Son of God, and to find redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/luke/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-21.htm">Mark 1:21-39</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/luke/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. rebuked them, &c.&#8212;(See on [1566]Lu 4:41).<p>thrown him, &c.&#8212;See on [1567]Mr 9:20.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-33.htm" title="And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,">Luke 4:33</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/luke/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jesus rebuked him,....

It is most instructive to contrast the simple sobriety of the narratives of the Evangelists with the credulous absurdities of even so able, polished and cosmopolitan a historian as Josephus, who describes an exorcism wrought in the presence of Vespasian by a certain Eleazar. It was achieved by means of a ring and the ‘root of Solomon,’ and the demon in proof of his exit was ordered to upset a bason of water! (Jos. <span class="ital">B. J.</span> vii. 6, § 3; <span class="ital">Antt.</span> viii. 2, § 5.) As this is the earliest of our Lord’s miracles recorded by St Luke, we may notice that the terms used for miracles in the Gospels are <span class="ital">teras</span> ‘prodigy,’ and <span class="ital">thaumasion</span> ‘wonderful’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-15.htm" title="And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,">Matthew 21:15</a> only), from the effect on men’s minds; <span class="ital">paradoxon</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-26.htm" title="And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.">Luke 5:26</a> only), from their strangeness; <span class="ital">sçmeia</span> ‘signs,’ and <span class="ital">dunameis</span> ‘powers,’ from their being indications of God’s power; <span class="ital">endoxa</span> ‘glorious deeds’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-17.htm" title="And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.">Luke 13:17</a> only), as shewing His glory; and in St John <span class="ital">erga</span> ‘works,’ as the natural actions of One who was divine. See Trench, <span class="ital">On Miracles</span>, i. 9. “Miracles, it should be observed, are not <span class="ital">contrary to</span> nature, but <span class="ital">beyond</span> and <span class="ital">above</span> it.” Mozley.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/luke/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-35.htm" title="And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.

Jesus at once indignantly refuses this homage. He never allowed devils to proclaim they knew him. There is something very awful in the thought that to this whole class of created beings he is ever pillions. In his dealings with these we never are allowed to catch sight of one ray of the Redeemer's tender pitiful love. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/luke/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Hold thy peace (&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit., be muzzled or gagged.
