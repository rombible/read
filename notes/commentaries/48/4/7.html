They could not fully understand the meaning of the law as given by Moses. And as that was a dispensation of darkness, so of bondage; they were tied to many burdensome rites and observances, by which they were taught and kept subject like a child under tutors and governors. We learn the happier state of Christians under the gospel dispensation. From these verses see the wonders of Divine love and mercy; particularly of God the Father, in sending his Son into the world to redeem and save us; of the Son of God, in submitting so low, and suffering so much for us; and of the Holy Spirit, in condescending to dwell in the hearts of believers, for such gracious purposes. Also, the advantages Christians enjoy under the gospel. Although by nature children of wrath and disobedience, they become by grace children of love, and partake of the nature of the children of God; for he will have all his children resemble him. Among men the eldest son is heir; but all God's children shall have the inheritance of eldest sons. May the temper and conduct of sons ever show our adoption; and may the Holy Spirit witness with our spirits that we are children and heirs of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore - In consequence of this privilege of addressing God as your Father.<p>Thou art no more - You who are Christians.<p>A servant - In the servitude of sin; or treated as a servant by being bound under the oppressive rites and ceremonies of the Law; compare the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a><p>But a son - A child of God, adopted into his family, and to be treated as a son.<p>And if a son ... - Entitled to all the privileges of a son, and of course to be regarded as an heir through the Redeemer, and with him.

Such an individual appropriation of this comforting truth God grants in answer to them who cry, "Abba, Father."<p>heir of God through Christ&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "an heir through God." This combines on behalf of man, the whole before-mentioned agency, of THE Trinity: the Father sent His Son and the Spirit; the Son has freed us from the law; the Spirit has completed our sonship. Thus the redeemed are heirs THROUGH the Triune God, not through the law, nor through fleshly descent [Windischmann in Alford]; (Ga 3:18 confirms this).<p>heir&#8212;confirming Ga 3:29; compare Ro 8:17.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou</span> that art a believing Gentile, as well as the believing Israelites, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">art no more a servant, </span> not in that state of servile subjection to the law; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">but a son; </span> but in a more excellent state of liberty, like unto that of sons that have attained to a full and ripe age. Christ told his disciples, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-15.htm" title="From now on I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.">John 15:15</a></span>, that he did not call them servants, for servants knew not what their lord did; but he had freely communicated to them what he had received from the Father. The apostle here saith, they were sons, sons by adoption; which is the highest notion of freedom and liberty. And this entitled them to an inheritance: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">if a son, then an heir of God through Christ:</span> which agreeth with <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a></span>. And as it is with sons and heirs, though the inheritance cometh not fully to them till the death of the parent, yet while they live they are in a far better condition than servants; so the believing Gentiles, being made sons and heirs of God through Christ, though they were to stay a while for the inheritance reserved for the sons of God in the heavens, yet their state was much better than that of servants; for though they were obliged to serve the Lord, yet they served him without servile fear, and were no otherwise servants than sons are also servants to their father. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/galatians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore thou art no more a servant,.... This is a benefit resulting from adoption, and the manifestation of it to the children of God, and supposes them to have been formerly servants; as whilst in a natural state they were the servants of sin, the vassals of Satan, slaves to the world, and the lusts of it, and in bondage to the law; but now being declared to be the sons of God under the witnessings of the Spirit, they are freed from the servitude of sin, from the captivity of Satan, from the slavery of the world, and particularly from the law, and that spirit of bondage which it brought upon them, which is chiefly designed; and from which they are delivered by the spirit of adoption, enabling and encouraging them to cry "Abba", Father; so that they are now no more under the former servile spirit, the spirit of a servant, <p>but a son; whose spirit, state, and case, are vastly different from those of a servant: the servant has not that interest in his master's affections as the son has; nor that liberty of access to him; nor is he fed and clothed as he is, or shares in the same privileges he does; nor is his obedience performed in the same free generous manner, from a principle of love and gratitude, but in a servile and mercenary way; and though he may expect his wages, he cannot hope for the inheritance; nor does he always abide in the house as the son does. He that is once a son, is always so, and no more a servant: predestination to sonship is immutable; it is God's act to put any among the children, and none can put them out; the covenant of grace, in which this blessing is secured, is unalterable; union with Christ, the Son of God, on which it is founded, is indissoluble; the spirit of adoption, wherever he witnesses, abides as such. They that are the sons of God may be corrected and chastised, as they often are, in a fatherly way; but these corrections are proofs for, and not against their sonship; they may indeed judge themselves unworthy to be called the sons of God, and may be in such frames of soul as to conclude, at least fear, they are not; but still the relation abides, and ever will. They will never more be servants, but always sons. The very learned Mr. Selden (i) thinks the apostle alludes to a custom among the Jews, who allowed only freemen, and not servants and handmaids, to call any Abba, Father such an one, or "Imma", Mother such an one: but this seems to proceed upon a mistaken sense, and rendering of a passage in the Talmud (k), which is as follows,        ; which he thus renders, "neither servants nor handmaids use this kind of appellation, Abba", or "Father such an one", and "Imma", or "Mother such an one"; whereas it should be rendered, "servants and handmaids, they do not call them Abba, Father such an one", and "Imma, Mother such an one"; this is clear from what follows. "The Family of "R. Gamaliel" used to call them Father such an one, and Mother such an one"; which in the other Talmud (l) is, "the family of" R. Gamaliel "used to call their servants and their handmaids Father Tabi, and Mother Tabitha"; which were the names of the servant and handmaid of Gamaliel. Rather therefore reference is had to a tradition (m) of theirs, that <p>"a servant, who is carried captive, when others redeemed him, if under the notion of a servant, or in order to be one, he becomes a servant; but if under the notion of a freeman, , "he is no more a servant".'' <p>Or to the general expectation of that people, that when they are redeemed by the Messiah, they shall be servants no more; for so they say (n), <p>"your fathers, though they were redeemed, became servants again, but you, when ye are redeemed,   , "shall be no more servants";'' <p>which in a spiritual sense is true of all that are redeemed by Christ, and through that redemption receive the adoption of children, and is what the apostle here means. <p>And if a son, then an heir of God through Christ; which is another benefit arising from adoption. Such as are the children of God, they are heirs of God himself; he is their portion and exceeding great reward; his perfections are on their side, and engaged for their good; all his purposes run the same way, and all his promises belong to them; they are heirs of all the blessings of grace and glory, of righteousness, of life, of salvation, and a kingdom and glory; and shall inherit all things, and all "through Christ": he is the grand heir of all things; they are joint heirs with him; their sonship is through him, and so is their heirship and inheritance; their inheritance is in his possession, it is reserved safe in him; and by him, and with him they shall enjoy it. The Alexandrian copy, and some others, only read, "an heir through God", and so the Vulgate Latin version; and the Ethiopic version only, "an heir of God". <p>(i) De Successionibus ad Leg.

II. § 142; Ewald, <span class="ital">Alterth</span>. p. 238 f.; Saalschütz, <span class="ital">M. R</span>. p. 820 f.). The apostle’s idea is founded on the intestate succession of the <span class="ital">Roman law</span>, with which Paul as a Roman citizen was acquainted, as in fact it was well known in the provinces and applied there as regarded Roman citizens. Comp. also Fritzsche, Tholuck, and van Hengel, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>. According to the Roman law sons and daughters, whether born in marriage or adopted children (and Paul conceives Christians as belonging to the latter class), were intestate heirs. It is evident in itself, and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a>, that <span class="greekheb">υἱός</span>, which Paul used here on account of its correlation with <span class="greekheb">δοῦλος</span>, does not, in the popular mode of expression, exclude the female sex.

To assume a mere allusion to <span class="ital">general human</span> laws of succession (Wieseler) is not sufficient; for Paul has very distinctly and clearly conceived and designated the <span class="greekheb">υἱότης</span> of the Christian as a relation of <span class="ital">adoption</span>, which presupposes for his conclusion as to the heirship a <span class="ital">special</span> legal reference, and not merely the general and vague correlation of the ideas of childship and heirship. The clear precision of his thought vouches for this, and it ought not to be evaded by declaring such a legal question even <span class="ital">foolish</span> (Hofmann),—a dogmatical judgment which is all the more precipitate, as the specific Johannean idea of the divine <span class="ital">begetting</span> of the children of God (comp.

As for the true force of the words, the Epistle has now traced the scheme of redemption and design of bestowing a heavenly inheritance in Christ as far back as the patriarchs, and has shown that from the time of Abraham downwards God was disciplining Israel with a view to their becoming sons of God, and again that He was really ordering the lives of Gentiles likewise, though they knew Him not, with the same intent.

It here marks the conclusion resulting from the statements of the preceding six verses, viz. of God having sent forth his Son to do away with the Law, subjection to which had marked the nonage of his people, and to raise them to their complete filial position, and of his then sending forth his Spirit into their hearts loudly protesting their sonship. "No longer art thou;" by this individualizing address the apostle strives to awaken each individual believer to the consciousness of the filial position belonging to him in particular. Believe it: in Christ Jesus, thou, thine own very self, art a son! The phrase, "no longer," marks the position of God's servant new, as compared with what it would have been before Christ had wrought his emancipating work and the Holy Spirit had been sent forth as the Spirit of adoption; <span class="accented">then</span> he would have still been a bond-servant; he is not that now. This abrupt singling out one individual as a sample of all the members of a class is an instance of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> of St. Paul's style (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>). The individual cited by the "thou" is neither a Gentile convert only nor a Jewish believer only; it is any member of God's kingdom. "A son," a member of God's family, an <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>), one free of all law of bondage and in full possession of a <span class="accented">son's</span> privileges; no sinner, now, under his Father's frown; but accepted, beloved, cherished, honoured with his Father's confidence. <span class="cmt_word">And if a son, then</span> <span class="cmt_word">an heir of God through Christ</span> (<span class="greek_word">ei) de\ ui(o/ kai\</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; <span class="accented">and if a son</span>, <span class="accented">an heir also through God.</span> So <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, "And if children (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), heirs also; heirs of God, joint-heirs with Christ." The inheritance here meant is the possession of every blessing which the theocratic kingdom entitles its members to look forward to. And the point of this added clause is that no further qualification is needed for our having a vested right in that inheritance, than that which is supplied by faith in Christ, uniting us to him and making us sharers with him; no such qualification, for example, as the Mosaizing reactionaries insisted upon (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>); no observance of ceremonial rites, whether of the Law or of such freaks of heretical" will-worship" as are referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>. Thy faith in Christ (says in effect the apostle) gives thee now for good and all an assured place in whatever inheritance God designs to give his people. The manuscripts 'rod other authorities for the text present considerable variety in the reading of the last words of this clause. The reading adopted by L. T. Tr., Meyer, Alford, Lightfoot, and Hort and Westcott, namely, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, is that found in the three oldest uncials, and presents a form of expression which was likely so greatly to surprise the copyist as to set him naturally upon the work of revision; whereas that of the Received Text, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, would have seemed to him so perfectly natural and easy that he would never have thought of altering it. The words, "<span class="accented">heir</span> through <span class="accented">God</span>," taken in connection with the foregoing context, insist upon the especial appointment of the supreme God himself; his intervention displayed in the most conspicuous manner conceivable, through the incarnated Son and the sent-forth Spirit. The believer is here said to be a son and an heir "through God," in the same sense as St. Paul affirms himself to be an apostle "through Jesus Christ and God the Father," and "through the will of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>); for "of him and through him and unto him are all things," and most manifestedly so, the things composing the economy of grace which the gospel announces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>). The apostle has thus brought back his discourse to the same point which it had reached before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>. The reader will do well to carefully compare this section of the Epistle (vers. 3-7) with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25-8:4</a> and Romans 8:14-17. With great similarity in the forms of expression, the difference of the <span class="accented">apostle's</span> object in the two Epistles is clearly discerned. <span class="accented">There</span> he is discoursing the more prominently of the believer's emancipation <span class="accented">from the controlling power of a sinful nature</span>, which, under the Law, viewed under its moral aspect rather than its ceremonial, was rather fretted into yet more aggravated disobedience than quelled or overpowered. <span class="accented">Here</span> his subject is more prominently the believer's emancipation from the thraldom of the Law's cere-monialism, which in the present Epistle, relative to the troubles in the Galatian Churches, he has more occasion to deal with. Both the one deliverance, however, and the other was necessary for the believer's full consciousness of adoptive sonship; and each was, in fact, involved in the other. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Servant (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Bondservant.

Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>. The figure is based upon Roman, not upon Jewish, law. According to Roman law, all the children, sons and daughters, inherited alike. According to Jewish law, the inheritance of the sons was unequal, and the daughters were excluded, except where there were no male heirs. Thus the Roman law furnished a more truthful illustration of the privileges of Christians.
