In their old heathen state they had been in bondage to gods that were no gods. From this bondage they had been delivered. They had been raised to a true knowledge of God, and received a Father’s recognition from Him. How then could they possibly think of returning to a system of mere ceremonialism. All this painful observance of times and seasons could only make the Apostle think that his labours on their behalf had been thrown away.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">Them which by nature are no gods.</span>—The gods of the heathen are called by St. Paul “devils.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1Corinthians 10:20</a> : “The things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils, and not to God.”)<span class= "bld"><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-8.htm" title="However, then, when you knew not God, you did service to them which by nature are no gods....">Galatians 4:8-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Howbeit </span>— <span class="greekheb">Αλλα</span>, <span class="ital">but, </span>or <span class="ital">however, </span>that ye Gentiles may not foolishly reject, neglect, or forfeit your privileges, as the sons of God, you ought to remember what your condition was while under <span class="ital">the elements of the world, </span>and compare it with your present happy state: that <span class="ital">then, when ye knew not </span>the one living and true <span class="ital">God, ye did service </span>— Performed many degrading, burdensome, irrational, and abominable acts of worship and <span class="ital">service, unto them which by nature are no gods </span>— “This is a true description of the idols worshipped by the heathen, for either they had no existence, being mere creatures of the imagination; or, if any of them existed, they were dead men, or evil spirits, or the luminaries of the heavens, [or other creatures of God, as most of the idols of Egypt were,] deified by human folly: and being destitute of divine perfections, they were utterly incapable of bestowing any blessing whatever on their worshippers.” <span class="ital">But now, after ye have known </span>the only true <span class="ital">God </span>— And his mind and will; <span class="ital">or rather are known of God </span>— Are acknowledged, approved, and accepted, as his children; <span class="ital">how turn ye again to the weak and</span> <span class="ital">beggarly elements </span>— <span class="ital">Weak, </span>utterly unable to purge your conscience from guilt, and to inspire you with filial confidence in God, or to change your nature, transform you into his likeness, and to enable you to do and suffer his will: <span class="ital">beggarly, </span>or poor; that is, incapable of enriching your souls with such wisdom, holiness, and happiness, as ye are heirs to, or to give you a hope of a blessed immortality after death; <span class="ital">whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage </span>— Though of another kind: now to these <span class="ital">elements, </span>as before to those idols; changing indeed the form and object of your ceremonies, but retaining many of the same low, perplexing, and unprofitable observances. <span class="ital">Ye observe days </span>— Jewish sabbaths; <span class="ital">and months </span>— New moons; <span class="ital">and times </span>— As that of the passover, pentecost, and the feast of tabernacles; <span class="ital">and years </span>— Annual solemnities.

All our knowledge of God begins on his part; we know him because we are known of him. Though our religion forbids idolatry, yet many practise spiritual idolatry in their hearts. For what a man loves most, and cares most for, that is his god: some have their riches for their god, some their pleasures, and some their lusts. And many ignorantly worship a god of their own making; a god made all of mercy and no justice. For they persuade themselves that there is mercy for them with God, though they repent not, but go on in their sins. It is possible for those who have made great professions of religion, to be afterwards drawn aside from purity and simplicity. And the more mercy God has shown, in bringing any to know the gospel, and the liberties and privileges of it, the greater their sin and folly in suffering themselves to be deprived of them. Hence all who are members of the outward church should learn to fear and to suspect themselves. We must not be content because we have some good things in ourselves. Paul fears lest his labour is in vain, yet he still labours; and thus to do, whatever follows, is true wisdom and the fear of God. This every man must remember in his place and calling.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Howbeit - But, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768;  alla. The address in this verse and the following is evidently to the portion of the Galatians who had been pagan. This is probably indicated by the particle &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768;  alla, but denoting a transition. In the previous verses Paul had evidently had the Jewish converts more particularly in his eye, and had described their former condition as one of servitude to the Mosaic rites and customs, and had shown the inconveniences of that condition, compared with the freedom imparted by the gospel. To complete the description, he refers also to the Gentiles, as a condition of worse servitude still, and shows <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a> the absurdity of their turning back to a state of bondage of any kind, after the glorious deliverance which they had obtained from the degrading servitude of pagan rites. The sense is, "If the Jews were in such a state of servitude, how much more galling and severe was that of those who had been pagans. Yet fron that servitude the gospel had delivered them, and made them freemen. How absurd now to go back to a state of vassalage, and to become servants under the oppressive rites of the Jewish law!"<p>When ye knew not God - In your state of paganism, when you had no knowledge of the true God and of his service. The object is not to apologize for what they did, because they did not know God; it is to state the fact that they were in a state of gross and galling servitude.<p>Ye did service - This does not express the force of the original. The meaning is, "Ye were "slaves" to (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  edouleusate); you were in a condition of servitude, as opposed to the freedom of the gospel;" compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>, where the same word is used to describe the state of the Jews. The drift of the apostle is, to show that the Jews and Gentiles, before their conversion to Christianity, were in a state of vassalage or servitude, and that it was absurd in the highest degree to return to that condition again.<p>Unto them which by nature are no gods - Idols, or false gods. The expression "by nature," &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  phusei, according to Grotius, means, "in fact, re ipsa." The sense is, that they really had no pretensions to divinity. Many of them were imaginary beings; many were the objects of creation, as the sun, and winds, and streams; and many were departed heroes that had been exalted to be objects of worship. Yet the servitude was real. It fettered their faculties; controlled their powers; bound their imagination, and commanded their time and property, and made them slaves. Idolatry is always slavery; and the servitude of sinners to their passions and appetites, to lust and gold, and ambition, is not less galling and severe than was the servitude to the pagan gods or the Jewish rites, or than is the servitude of the African now to a harsh and cruel master. Of all Christians it may be said that before their conversion they "did service," or were slaves to harsh and cruel masters; and nothing but the gospel has made them free. It may be added, that the chains of idolatry all over the world are as fast riveted and as galling as they were in Galatia, and that nothing but the same gospel which Paul preached there can break those chains and restore man to freedom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-11.

This service lay in paying homage to them, worshipping of them, and performing various rites and ceremonies in a way of adoration, and which they reckoned religious service; and which, comparatively speaking, whilst in this state of blindness, was excusable in them; though it is a wonderful instance of grace that such idolaters should be the sons of God. <p>(o) Aveda Zara. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</span><p>(4) He applies the former doctrine to the Galatians, with a special rebuke: for in comparison with them, the Jews might have pretended some excuse as men that were born and brought up in that service of the Law.

In such cases we have often no resource in English but to leave the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> untranslated, as our Authorized Version commonly does; "indeed" or "truly," for example, would be more or less misleading. The truth is, the apostle in these two verses is heaping reproach upon the Galatian Judaizers; first, in this verse, for their former (guilty) ignorance of God and their idolatries, and then, in the next verse, for their slighting that blessed friendship with God which they owed only to his preventing grace. In dealing with Gentile Christians the apostle repeatedly is found referring to their former heathenism, for the purpose of enforcing humility or abashing presumption, as for example in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13, 17</a>. In the case of the Galatians his indignation prompts him to use a degree of outspoken severity which he was generally disposed to forbear employing. The "then" is not defined, as English readers might perhaps misconstrue the Authorized Version as intending, by the following clause, "not knowing God," which in that version is "when ye knew not God" - a construction of the words which the use of the participle would hardly warrant; rather the time referred to by the adverb is the time of which he has before been speaking, when God's people were under the pedagogy of the Law. This, though when compared with Christ's liberty a state of bondage, was, however (the apostle feels), a position of high advancement as compared with that of heathen idolaters. These last were "<span class="accented">far</span> off," while the Israelites were "<span class="accented">nigh"</span> (compare the <span class="accented">passages</span> just now referred to). During that time of legal pedagogy the Galatians and their forefathers, all in the apostle's view forming one class, were wallowing in the mire of heathenism. <span class="cmt_word">When ye knew not</span> <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (<span class="greek_word">ou)k ei)do/te Qeo/n</span>); <span class="accented">ye knew not God and</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> "Knowing not God" describes the condition of heathens also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:5</a>," Not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles which know not (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) God;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, "Rendering vengeance to them that know not (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) God." Both of these passages favour the view that the apostle does not in the least intend in the present clause to <span class="accented">excuse</span> the idolatries which he goes on to speak of, but rather to describe a condition of godlessness which, as being positive rather than merely negative, inferred utter pravity and guiltiness. He uses <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> with the participle here, in place of the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> in the two <span class="accented">passages c</span>ited from the <span class="accented">Thessalonians</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> intending to state an historical fact viewed absolutely - a sense which is made clear in English by substituting an indicative verb for the participle. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did service unto</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">served</span>; devoted yourselves to. The verb is, perhaps, used here in that milder sense in which it frequently occurs; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-29.htm">Luke 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-18.htm">Romans 14:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. The Revised Version, however, gives "were in bondage to" in the present instance, but "serve" in the <span class="accented">passages now</span> cited. The aorist, instead of an imperfect, describes the form of religious life which they then led as a whole. <span class="cmt_word">Them which by nature are</span> <span class="cmt_word">no gods</span> (<span class="greek_word">toi  =   fu/sei mh\ ou  =  si</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, which would apparently mean "which arc not gods by nature, but only in your imagination;" like "There be that are called gods," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-5.htm">1 Corinthians 8:5</a> - Zeus, Apollo, Here, etc., mere figments of imagination (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>). The more approved reading suggests rather the idea that the objects they worshipped might not be non-existent, but were certainly not of a Divine nature; "by nature," that is, in the kind of being to which they belong (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; Wisd. 13:1, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The question may be asked - If they were not gods, what then were they? The apostle would probably have answered, "Demons;" for thus he writes to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>): "The things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and not to God." Alford renders, "to gods which by nature exist not," etc.; but the more obvious sense of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is that of a copula merely (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-9.htm">2 Chronicles 13:9</a>, Septuagint, "He became a priest (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>)"). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Over against their filial freedom in Christ, Paul sets their lapse into subjection to the elements of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>).<p>Knew not God<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>.<p>Ye did service (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Better, were in bondage or were slaves.<p>By nature (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Not denying their existence (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-5.htm">1 Corinthians 8:5</a>) but their deity.
