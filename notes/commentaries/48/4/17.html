Not but that it is a good thing for teachers and taught—you and I—to seek favour with each other, so long as it is done disinterestedly, and that, too, when I am absent as well as when I am present. My heart yearns towards you. I cannot forget that you owe your life, as Christians, to me. Now, once more, it seems as if all that long travail has to be gone over again. You must be re-fashioned in the likeness of Christ, as the infant is fashioned in the form of man. Would that I could be with you and speak in a different tone, for how to deal with you I do not know.<p>(17) <span class= "bld">They zealously affect you.</span>—“Zealously affect” is a single word in the Greek, and means “to show zeal towards,” “to court,” “to curry favour with,” “to canvass eagerly, so as to win over to their side.” The subject of this verse is the Judaising teachers.<p><span class= "bld">They would exclude you.</span>—They desire to separate you from the rest of the Gentile churches, and to make a sect by itself, in which they themselves may bear rule. All the other Gentile churches had accepted the freer teaching of St. Paul; the Judaising party wished to make of Galatia an isolated centre of Judaism. They did this with personal motives, “not well”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from honest and honourable motives—but with a view to secure their own ascendancy.<p><span class= "bld">That ye might affect them.</span>—The same word as “zealously affect” above and in the next verse.

It may be proper to observe, that the original expression “may refer either to a good person or a good thing, and may be understood of their continuing zealous in their affection, either to himself, or to the truth which he preached; but as he had been speaking of himself in the foregoing verses, he likewise seems to have still in view the warmth of their affection to him when he was present with them; though he expresses it in a graceful way, with such a latitude as may include their zeal for his doctrine as well as for his person.” — Doddridge.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:12-18 The apostle desires that they would be of one mind with him respecting the law of Moses, as well as united with him in love. In reproving others, we should take care to convince them that our reproofs are from sincere regard to the honour of God and religion and their welfare. The apostle reminds the Galatians of the difficulty under which he laboured when he first came among them. But he notices, that he was a welcome messenger to them. Yet how very uncertain are the favour and respect of men! Let us labour to be accepted of God. You once thought yourselves happy in receiving the gospel; have you now reason to think otherwise? Christians must not forbear speaking the truth, for fear of offending others. The false teachers who drew the Galatians from the truth of the gospel were designing men. They pretended affection, but they were not sincere and upright. An excellent rule is given. It is good to be zealous always in a good thing; not for a time only, or now and then, but always. Happy would it be for the church of Christ, if this zeal was better maintained.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They zealously affect you - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a> (Greek); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-39.htm">1 Corinthians 14:39</a>. The word used here (&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9;  Ze&#772;loo&#772;), means to be "zealous" toward, that is, for or against any person or thing; usually, in a good sense, to be eager for. Here it means, that the false teachers made a show of zeal toward the Galatians, or professed affection for them in order to gain them as their followers. They were full of ardor, and professed an extraordinary concern for their welfare - as people always do who are demagogues, or who seek to gain proselytes. The object of the apostle in this is, probably, to say, that it was not wholly owing to themselves that they had become alienated from the doctrines which he had taught. Great pains had been taken to do it; and there had been a show of zeal which would be likely to endanger any person.<p>But not well - Not with good motives, or with good designs.<p>Yea, they would exclude you - Margin, "Us." A few printed editions of the New Testament have &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;  he&#772;mas, "us," instead of &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;  humas, "you" - Mill. The word "exclude" here probably means, that they endeavored to exclude the Galatians from the love and affection of Paul. They would shut them out from that, in order that they might secure them for their own purposes. If the reading in the margin, however, should be retained, the sense would be clearer. "They wish to exclude us, that is, me, the apostle, in order that they may have you wholly to themselves. If they can once get rid of your attachment to me, then they will have no difficulty in securing you for themselves." This reading, says Rosenmuller, is found "in many of the best codices, and versions, and fathers." It is adopted by Doddridge, Locke, and others. The main idea is clear: Paul stood in the way of their designs. The Galatians were truly attached to him, and it was necessary, in order to accomplish their ends, to withdraw their affections from him. When false teachers have designs on a people, they begin by alienating their confidence and affections from their pastors and teachers. They can hope for no success until this is done; and hence, the efforts of errorists, and of infidels, and of scorners, is to undermine the confidence of a people in the ministry, and when this is done there is little difficulty in drawing them over to their own purposes.<p>That ye might affect them - The same word as in the former part of the verse, "that ye might zealously affect them" - that is, that ye might show ardent attachment to them. Their first work is to manifest special interest for your welfare; their second, to alienate you from him who had first preached the gospel to you; their object, not your salvation, or your real good, but to secure your zealous love for themselves. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

Alford explains it, that their wish was to shut out the Galatians from the general community, and attract them as a separate clique to their own party. So the English word "exclusive," is used.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They; </span> the false teachers, that have perverted you as to the faith of the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Zealously affect you; </span> pretend a great warmth of affection for you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But not well; </span> but in this they do not well, nor for a good end. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They would exclude you</span> from our good opinion and affection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That ye might affect them; </span> that they might have all your love and respect; and so, by the ruin of our reputation with you, they might build up their own reputation. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/galatians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>They zealously affect you,.... Or "are jealous of you"; meaning the false apostles, whose names, in contempt, he mentions not, being unworthy to be taken notice of, and their names to be transmitted to posterity. These were jealous of them, not with a godly jealousy, as the apostle was, lest their minds should be corrupted from the simplicity of the Gospel; but they were jealous, lest they should love the apostle more than they, and therefore represented him in a very bad light, and expressed great love and kindness for them themselves: <p>but not well; their zeal and affection were not hearty, and sincere, and without dissimulation, but were all feigned, were only in word and in tongue, not in deed, and in truth: this zealous affection neither proceeded from right principles, nor with right views; they sought themselves, and their own carnal worldly interest, their own pleasure and profit, and not the good and welfare of the souls of these Galatians: <p>yea, they would exclude you; that is, either from the apostle, from bearing any love unto, and having any respect for him. What they were wishing and seeking for was to draw off the minds and affections of these persons from him; or they were desirous of removing them from the Gospel of Christ unto another Gospel, and did all they could to hinder them from obeying the truth; and particularly were for shutting them out of their Christian liberty, and bringing them under the bondage of the law; yea, were for separating them from the churches, that they might set up themselves at the head of them. Some copies read "us", instead of "you"; and then the meaning is, that they were desirous of excluding the apostle from their company, and from having any share in their affections, which makes little alteration in the sense: and others, instead of "exclude", read "include"; and which is confirmed by the Syriac version, which renders the word  "but they would include you"; that is, either they would include, or imprison you under the law, and the bondage of it; or they would monopolize you, and engross all your love to themselves; and which is also the sense of the Arabic version: <p>that you might affect them; love them, show respect to them, be on their side, follow their directions, imbibe their doctrines, and give up yourselves wholly to their care, and be at their call and command. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They zealously affect you, <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> <i>but</i> not well; yea, they would exclude you, <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> that ye might affect them.</span><p>(q) For they are jealous over you for their own benefit.<p>(r) That they may transfer all your love from me to themselves.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/galatians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-17.htm" title="They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them.">Galatians 4:17</a>. The self-seeking conduct of the Judaizing teachers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm" title="Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.">Galatians 1:7</a>), so entirely opposed to the <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύων ὑμῖν</span>. The fact <span class="ital">that they are not named</span> is quite in keeping with the emotion and irritation of the moment; “nam solemus suppresso nomine de iis loqui, quos nominare piget ac taedet,” Calvin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ζηλοῦσιν ὑμᾶς</span>] that is, they exert themselves urgently to win you over to their side; they pay their court to you zealously. So, correctly, Erasmus, Castalio, Er. Schmid, Michaelis, and others, including Flatt, Winer, Usteri, Schott, Fritzsche, Olshausen, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette, Ewald, Wieseler, and Hofmann. For the contrast to the behaviour <span class="ital">of the apostle</span> harmonizes well with this sense; which is also accordant with linguistic usage, since <span class="greekheb">ζηλόω</span> with the accusative means <span class="ital">to be zealous about a person or thing</span>, and obtains in each case the more precise definition of its import from the context; Dem. 1402. 20. 500. 2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-1.htm" title="Be not you envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.">Proverbs 24:1</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/1-12.htm" title="Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not upon yourselves destruction with the works of your hands.">Wis 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm" title="But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I to you a more excellent way.">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; and see Wetstein. Next to this interpretation comes that of Calvin, Beza, and others, including Rückert (comp. Vulgate: <span class="ital">aemulantur</span>): <span class="ital">they are jealous of you</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/9-1.htm" title="Be not jealous over the wife of thy bosom, and teach her not an evil lesson against thyself.">Sir 9:1</a>). Taking it so, it would not be necessary to conceive of Paul and his opponents under the figure of wooers of the bride (the bridegroom being Christ; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>), of which nothing is suggested by the context; but it may be urged against this explanation, that <span class="greekheb">ἵνα αὐτοὺς ζηλοῦτε</span> is not appropriate in the same sense. This remark also applies to the interpretation of Koppe and Reithmayr, following Ambrose, Jerome, and Theodoret: “<span class="ital">they envy you</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-9.htm" title="And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,">Acts 7:9</a>), are full of an envious jealousy of your freedom;” and to that of Chrysostom and Theophylact: <span class="ital">they vie with you</span> (comp. Borger); <span class="greekheb">ζῆλος μέν ἐστιν ἀγαθὸς ὅταν τις ἀρετὴν μιμῆταί τινος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ζῆλος δὲ οὐ καλὸς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅταν τις σπεύδῃ ἐκβαλεῖν τῆς ἀρετῆς τὸν κατορθοῦντα</span> (Theophylact). The <span class="ital">factitive</span> explanation: <span class="ital">they make you to be zealous</span> (Matthias), is opposed to linguistic usage, which only sanctions <span class="greekheb">παραζηλόω</span>, and not the simple verb, in this sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐ καλῶς</span>] <span class="ital">not in a morally fair, honourable</span> <span class="ital">way</span>, as would have been the case, if it had been done for your real good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκκλεῖσαι</span>] <span class="ital">To exclude</span>;[199] they desire to <span class="ital">debar you;</span> in this lies the <span class="ital">wickedness</span> of their <span class="greekheb">ζῆλος</span>. The question which arises here, and cannot be set aside (as Hofmann thinks): Exclude <span class="ital">from what?</span> is answered by the emphatic <span class="greekheb">αὐτούς</span> which follows, namely, <span class="ital">from other teachers</span>, who do not belong to their clique.[200] These “other teachers” are naturally those of anti-Judaizing views, and consequently Paul himself and his followers; but the hypothesis that Paul <span class="ital">only</span> is referred to (“a me meique communione,” Winer; so also Luther, Calvin, Grotius, Bengel, Kypke, Michaelis, Rückert, Olshausen, Reiche, and others) is the less feasible, as the very idea of <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλεῖσαι</span> in itself most naturally points to a plurality, to an association. Since the <span class="greekheb">αὐτούς</span> which follows applies to the false teachers as <span class="ital">teachers</span>, we must not conceive the <span class="ital">exclusion</span> (with Borger and Flatt) as <span class="ital">from the whole body of Christians</span>, nor (with Schott) as <span class="ital">from all Christians thinking differently;</span> comp. Hilgenfeld: “from the Pauline <span class="ital">church-union</span>.” It is arbitrarily taken by Chrysostom, Oecumenius, and Theophylact, as exclusion from the <span class="ital">state of true knowledge;</span> by Erasmus and Cornelius a Lapide, from <span class="ital">Christian freedom;</span> by Luther (1519), <span class="ital">a Christo et fiducia ejus</span>; by Matthies, from <span class="ital">the kingdom of truth</span> (comp. Ewald: from <span class="ital">genuine Christianity</span>); by Wieseler and Reithmayr, from <span class="ital">the kingdom of heaven;</span> by Matthias, from <span class="ital">salvation by faith</span>. All Interpretations of This nature would have needed some more precise definition. Koppe falls into a peculiar error: “a consuetudine et familiaritate <span class="ital">sua</span> arcere vos volunt” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.">Galatians 2:12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα αὐτοὺς ζηλοῦτε</span>] As <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> is used here with the present <span class="ital">indicative</span>, it cannot mean <span class="ital">in order that;</span>[201] but must be the particle of <span class="ital">place, ubi</span> (Valckenaer, <span class="ital">ad Herod</span>, ix. 27: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα δοκέει κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.). This <span class="ital">ubi</span> may, however, mean either: <span class="ital">in which position of things</span> ye are zealous <span class="ital">for them</span> (my former explanation), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.">1 Corinthians 4:6</a> (see on that passage, and Ellendt, <span class="ital">Lex. Soph</span>. I. p. 839); or, in its <span class="ital">purely local</span> sense: “they wish to debar you <span class="ital">there, where</span> you are zealous <span class="ital">for them</span>,”—namely, in the <span class="ital">Judaistic circle</span>, in which it is <span class="ital">they themselves</span> who are zealously courted by you, whose favour you have to seek, etc. The latter view, as the simplest, is to be preferred. On the usual explanation of <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> as a <span class="ital">particle of design</span>, recourse is had to the assumption of an abnormal construction of degenerate Greek (Winer, Olshausen, Hilgenfeld, Wieseler, Hofmann, Reithmayr, and others); or of a mistake on the part of the author or of the transcriber (Schott); or, with Fritzsche, to the reading <span class="greekheb">ζηλῶτε</span> (which only 113 and 219** have). But all these makeshifts are quite as arbitrary as the assumption of a faulty formation of mood (Rückert, Matthies). The interpretation of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ</span></span></span> as <span class="ital">ubi</span> is based not on an “exaggerated philological precision,”[202] but on a linguistic necessity, to which the customary interpretation, yielding certainly a sense appropriate enough in itself, must give way, because the latter <span class="ital">absolutely</span> requires the <span class="ital">subjunctive</span> mood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[199] Syr. translates <span class="ital">includere</span>, and consequently read <span class="greekheb">ἐγκλεῖσαι</span>. This would mean: <span class="ital">they desire to include you</span> in their circle, so that ye should not get free from them and come to associate with other teachers. Thus, in point of fact, the same sense would result as in the case of <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλεῖσαι</span>, only regarded from a different point of view. Fritzsche’s reference of <span class="greekheb">ἐγκλ</span>. to the <span class="ital">legis Mos. carcerem</span> is not suggested by the context. The reading is altogether so weakly attested, that it can only be looked upon as an ancient error of transcription.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[200] The wish expressed by Erasmus in his <span class="ital">Annott.:</span> “Utinam hodie nulli sint apud Christianos in quos competat haec Pauli querimonia!” is still but too applicable to the present day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[201] <span class="greekheb">ζηλοῦτε</span> is not the <span class="ital">Attic future</span> (Jatho). See Winer, p. 72 [E. T. 88]; Buttmann, p. 33. In Thuc. ii. 8. 3, and iii. 58. 4, <span class="greekheb">ἐλευθεροῦσι</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐρημοῦτε</span> are <span class="ital">presents;</span> see Krüger <span class="ital">in loc</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[202] As Hilgenfeld thinks, who appeals in favour of <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">ut</span>, with the indicative to Clem. <span class="ital">Hom</span>. xi. 16: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μηδὲν τῶν προσκυνουμένων ὑπῆρχεν</span>. This is certainly not “philological precision,” but inattention to linguistic fact; for in this Clementine passage the quite customary <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">ut</span>, is used with the indicative of the <span class="ital">preterite</span>, “quod tum fit, quando ponitur aliquid, quod erat futurum, si aliud quid factum esset, sed jam non est factum,” Klotz, <span class="ital">ad Devar</span>. p. 630 f.; Herm. <span class="ital">ad Viger</span>. p. 850 f.; Kühner, II. § 778.

The substantive <span class="greekheb">ζῆλος</span> (probably derived from <span class="greekheb">ζέειν</span>, <span class="ital">burn</span>) denotes some kind of passionate desire. Whether it was of good or evil tendency depended on the nature of its object and the spirit in which it was pursued: for the same term was used to designate zeal for God or for some noble object, personal passion, or an exclusive spirit of selfish jealousy. The verb <span class="greekheb">ζηλοῦν</span> partakes of the same neutral quality. Its figurative meaning is here borrowed from the efforts of a lover to win favour. The Pharisaic party <span class="ital">affected</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, courted) the Galatians in a selfish spirit, being minded to shut them out of their rightful inheritance in Christ, that they might reduce them to dependence on their own Law. Paul also courted them, not for his own glory, but that he might join them to Christ, and he was glad that they should be courted at all times, even by others in his absence, if it was done in a right spirit. <span class="ital">They affect you</span> (he writes, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, court you) <span class="ital">not honourably, but are minded to shut you out that you may affect them. But it is good for you to be affected at all times and not only when I am present with you</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ζηλοῦτε</span>. As there are no other instances of <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> being followed by an indicative present in Pauline language, it is probable that this and <span class="greekheb">φυσιοῦσθε</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.">1 Corinthians 4:6</a> are really forms of the subjunctive, though <span class="greekheb">ζηλῶτε</span> is the contracted form in general use.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17, 18</span>. In contrast to the simplicity of his own teaching, St Paul exposes the party spirit by which the false teachers were actuated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">They zealously affect you</span>] The sentence is abrupt, no persons being named; though St Paul evidently had in his mind those alluded to ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm" title="Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.">Galatians 1:7</a>. The expression ‘zealously affect’ is not very intelligible to the ordinary reader. The verb, which is rendered ‘affect’ in this same verse, is used frequently in N. T. with reference to both persons and things. Originally it meant to feel or shew zeal, jealousy or envy. From this sense the transition was easy to that of ‘desire earnestly’, ‘pay court to’, ‘seek to win or win over’. The word is used in a good and a bad sense by St Paul, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm" title="But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I to you a more excellent way.">1 Corinthians 12:31</a> where it is rendered ‘covet’, i.e. desire, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,">1 Corinthians 13:4</a> ‘Love envieth not’. Here the meaning is ‘They seek to win you over to their own party’. Error must be maintained and propagated by proselytising and partisanship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The whole passage may be paraphrased—‘They seek to gain you to their own party, but not with right motives, nay, they would exclude you from my influence, in the hope of your reciprocating their desire for your adhesion. But let me remind you that a desire of this kind is only to be approved when the motives are pure and the object good. Under such conditions it is <span class="ital">always</span> good. Such were the conditions under which I sought to win you to Christ when I was present with you; such is still the case now that we are separated’. This leads up to the tender yet sad remonstrance which follows. In support of this view of the connexion and train of thought we may compare St Paul’s words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a> “I am jealous over you (I would fain win you, not from party spirit or for personal ends, but) with a Godly jealousy (or longing desire)”. True love is always jealous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they would exclude you</span>] Some copies read ‘us’ for ‘you’. The sense is the same. There seems to be an allusion to some attempt on the part of the Judaizers to induce the Galatian converts formally to renounce their allegiance to St Paul.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/galatians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-17.htm" title="They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them.">Galatians 4:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ζηλοῦσιν</span>, <span class="ital">they zealously affect</span>) They <span class="ital">zealously</span> solicit [cajole] you.

The antithesis is, <span class="greekheb">ἐν καλῷ</span>, <span class="ital">in a good thing</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-18.htm" title="But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.">Galatians 4:18</a>.

They think, that we shall be excluded from you; but they would not exclude us from you, but you from us: <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλεῖσαι</span>, I am disposed to think, is not used in the sense, in which the Latins say that chickens are hatched (excludi, <span class="ital">thrust forth from the shell</span>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They zealously affect you, but</span> <span class="cmt_word">not well</span> (<span class="greek_word">zhlou  =  sin u(ma  =   ou) kalw  =  </span>); <span class="accented">they admire you in no good way.</span> Of the several  senses of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, those of "envy," "emulate," "strive after," are plainly unsuitable in this verse and the one which follows. So also are the senses "to be zealous on one's behalf, to be jealous of one," which in Hellenistic usage crept into it, apparently from its having been in other senses adopted to represent the Hebrew verb <span class="accented">qinne</span>, and borrowing these from this Hebrew verb. The only phase of its meaning which suits the present passage is that which it perhaps by far the most frequently presents in ordinary Greek, though not so commonly in the Septuagint and in the New Testa ment, namely, "to admire," "deem and pronounce highly fortunate and blessed." When used in this sense, it has properly for its object a person; but with a suitable qualification of meaning it may have for its object something inanimate. Very often is the accusative of the person accompanied with the genitive of the ground of gratulation, as Aristophanes, 'Ach.,' 972, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>  "I congratulate, admire, you for your cleverness;" see also 'Equit.,' 834; 'Thes moph.,' 175; 'Vesp.,' 1450; but not always; thus Demosthenes, 'Fals. Legat.,' p. 424, "(<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) they admire and congratulate and would each one be himself the like;" 'Adv. Lept.,' p. 500 (respecting public funeral orations), "This is the custom of men admiring (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) virtue, not of men looking grudgingly upon those who on its account are being honoured;" Xenophon, 'Mere.,' 2:1,19. "Thinking highly of themselves, and praised and admired (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">by</span> others;" Josephus, 'C. Ap.,' 1:25, "(<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) admired by many." It thus seems to be often just equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, with the sense of which latter verb it is brought into close neighbourhood in Aristophanes, 'Nubes,' 1188, "' Blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>), Strepsiades, are you, both for being so wise yourself and for having such a son as you have,' - thus will my friends and fellow-wardsmen say, in admiration of me (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>)." Probably this is the sense in which the apostle uses the verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I rejoice in your felicity with an infinite joy;" referring to the intense admiration which he felt of their present felicity, in their having been betrothed a chaste maiden to Christ; not till the next verse introducing the mention of his fear lest this paradisaical happiness might be darkened by the wiles of Satan. It is in a modified shade of the same sense that the word is employee  - where it is rendered "covet earnestly" in our Authorized Version in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1, 39</a>. In the passage now. before us, then, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> probably means "they admire you," that is, they tell you so. They were expressing strong admiration of the high Christian character and eminent gifts of these simple-minded believers; the charisms which had been bestowed upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a>); their virtues, in contrast especially with their heathen neighbours; their spiritual enlightenment. No doubt all this was said with the view of courting their favour; but <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> can hardly itself mean "court favour," and no instance of its occurring in this sense has been adduced; and this rendering of the verb breaks down utterly in ver. 18. The persons referred to must, of course, be understood as those who were busy in instilling at once Judaizing sentiments and also feelings of antipathy to the apostle himself, as if he were their enemy (ver. 16). The Epistle furnishes no indication whatever that these persons were strangers coming among them from without, answering, for example, to those spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a> as disturbing the Antiochian Church. It is quite supposable that the warning which, not long after the writing of this Epistle, the apostle addressed to the Ephesian elders at Miletus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29, 30</a>), when putting them on their guard against those who "from among their own selves should rise up speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them," was founded in part upon this experience of his in the Galatian Churches. Galatian Churchmen it may well have been, and no other, who now (as the apostle had just been apprised) were employing that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, that "kind suave speech" and that "speech of compliment and laudation," which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a> he describes as a favourite device of this class of deceivers, to win the ear of their unwary brethren. "In no good way;" for they did it insincerely and with the purpose of drawing them <span class="accented">into</span> courses which, though these men themselves knew it not, were nevertheless fraught with ruin to their spiritual welfare. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they would</span> <span class="cmt_word">exclude you;</span> or, us (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">nay<span class="cmt_word"></span>,</span> <span class="accented">rather</span>, <span class="accented">to shut you out is their wish.</span> The reading "us," noticed in the margin of the Authorized Version, is probably a merely conjectural emendation made in the Greek text by Beza, wholly unsupported by manuscript authority. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> is adversative to the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, the secondary thought of the preceding clause, in the same way as the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a> is adversative to the secondary negative clauses of ver. 6. The verb "shut out," with no determinative qualification annexed, must have it supplied from the unexpressed ground for the "admiration" denoted by the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The high eminence of spiritual condition and happiness on the possession of which these men were congratulating their brethren, they would be certainly excluded from if they listened to <span class="accented">them.</span> Compare the phrase, "who are unsettling you," driving you out  of house and home, in ch. 5:12, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">That ye might affect them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">that ye may admire themselves.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> makes it emphatic. We may paraphrase thus: that, being detached from regard to my teaching, and made to feel a certain grave deficiency on your own part in respect to acceptableness with God, ye may be led to look up as disciples to these kind-hearted sympathetic advisers for instruction and guidance. The construction of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which in ordinary Greek is the present <span class="accented">indicative</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> being the form for the present <span class="accented">subjunctive</span>, is precisely similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>. When it is considered how punctually St. Paul is wont to comply with the syntactical rule with reference to <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, and that these two remarkable deflections therefrom are connected with contract forms of verbs in -<span class="greek">&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, Ruckert's suggestion seems to be perfectly reasonable, that the solecism lies, not in the syntactical construction, but in the grammatical in flexion, contracting -<span class="greek">&#x1f79;&#x3b7;</span> into -<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> instead of into-<span class="greek">&#x1ff6;</span>. This form of contraction may have been a provincialism of Tarsus, or it may have been an idiotism of St. Paul himself.
