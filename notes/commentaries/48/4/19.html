It is used to heighten the tenderness of the appeal. The simple form, however, “my children,” is found in some of the best MSS., and perhaps should be adopted. St. Paul regards as his spiritual children all who first received the gospel from him.<p><span class= "bld">Of whom I travail in birth again.</span>—The struggle which ends in the definite winning over of his converts to Christ, the Apostle compares to the process of birth by which “a man is born into the world.” In the case of the Galatians, after their relapse, this struggle has all to be gone through again.<p><span class= "bld">Until Christ be formed in you.</span>—Just as the formless embryo by degrees takes the shape of man, so the unformed Christian by degrees takes the likeness of Christ. As he grows in grace that likeness becomes more and more defined, till at last the Christian reaches the “stature of the fulness of Christ” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>). There is some question as to the punctuation of this verse: whether it should be divided from the last by a full stop, and from the next by a comma, as is usually done; or from the last by a comma, and from the next by a full-stop. It is a nice question of scholarship, in which the weight or preponderance of authority seems, perhaps, rather to incline to the usual view, though some good commentators take the other side. It has been thought best not to alter the punctuation of the English text, though without a clear conviction that it is right.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,...">Galatians 4:19-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">My little children </span>— Converted to the faith by my ministry. He speaks as a parent, both with authority and the most tender sympathy toward weak and sickly children: <span class="ital">of whom I travail in birth again </span>— As I did before, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm" title="You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.">Galatians 4:13</a>,) in vehement pain, sorrow, desire, prayer; <span class="ital">till Christ be formed in you </span>— Till you be made fully acquainted with, and established in, the belief of every part of his doctrine; and till you be so endowed with the graces of his Spirit, that all the mind is in you that was in him. The image here used by the apostle is beautiful and expressive. He alludes to a mother, who, having undergone the labour and pains of childbearing, cannot but be concerned for the safety and welfare of the children, in the birth of which she had suffered so much: and if the life or health of any of them be in imminent danger, suffers distress and anguish of mind, nearly, if not altogether, equal or even superior, to the pain and torture of body she endured in bearing them. So the apostle, who had once before suffered labour and pains like those of childbearing, when he converted the Galatians to the truth, now suffered those pangs a second time, while he endeavoured to bring them back to that faith of the gospel from which they had departed. It is not possible by words to express the anxiety of desire and affection which he felt on this occasion more strongly than he has done by this image; and what a lesson does this teach every minister of the gospel, intrusted with the care of immortal souls! What distress ought they to feel, how deeply ought they to be concerned, when they observe any of the souls that they had gained, backsliding from the truth and grace of God, and drawing back unto perdition! and what anxiety should they manifest, and what pains should they take, to recover and restore them. <span class="ital">I desire </span>— Or I could wish; <span class="ital">to be present with you now </span>— Particularly in this exigence; <span class="ital">and to change my voice </span>— To adapt my manner of speaking to the state you are in; <span class="ital">for I stand in doubt of you </span>— So that I am at a loss how to speak at this distance; for though I do not absolutely despair of your recovery and establishment, yet I am not without very discouraging apprehensions, lest, after all the pains that I have taken with you, the good effects of my labours among you should in a great measure be lost.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:19,20 The Galatians were ready to account the apostle their enemy, but he assures them he was their friend; he had the feelings of a parent toward them. He was in doubt as to their state, and was anxious to know the result of their present delusions. Nothing is so sure a proof that a sinner has passed into a state of justification, as Christ being formed in him by the renewal of the Holy Spirit; but this cannot be hoped for, while men depend on the law for acceptance with God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My little children - The language of tender affection, such as a parent would use toward his own offspring; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-12.htm">1 John 2:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>.

A soft and tender way of speaking, used by Christ to his disciples, and frequently by that affectionate and beloved disciple, John. It is expressive of the apostle's strong love and affection for them, and points out their tenderness in the faith, and that small degree of spiritual light and knowledge they had, as well as signifies that he had been, as he hoped, and in a judgment of charity believed, an instrument of their conversion, and was their spiritual parent: hence it follows, <p>of whom I travail in birth again; he compares himself to a woman with child, as the church in bringing forth souls to Christ sometimes is; and all his pains and labours in the ministry of the word to the sorrows of a woman during the time of childbearing, and at the birth. When he first came among them, he laboured exceedingly; he preached the Gospel in season, and out of season; he followed his indefatigable endeavours with importunate prayers; and his ministry among them was attended with much weakness of body, and with many reproaches, afflictions, and persecutions, comparable to the birth throes of a woman in travail: however, as he hoped he was the means of their being born again, of the turning of them from Heathenism to Christianity, and from serving idols to serve the living God, and believe in his Son Jesus Christ; but the false apostles coming among them had so strangely wrought upon them, and they were so much gone back and degenerated, that they seemed to be like so many abortions, or as an unformed foetus; wherefore he laboured again with all his might and main, by writing to them, using arguments with them, sometimes giving them good words, at other times rough ones, and fervently praying for them, if possible, to recover them from Judaism, to which they were inclined, to the pure Gospel of Christ. <p>Until Christ be formed in you; which is the same as to be created in Christ, to be made new creatures, or new men in him; or, in other words, to have the principle of grace wrought in the soul, which goes by the name of Christ formed in the heart; because it is from him, he is the author of it, and it bears a resemblance to him, and is that by which he lives, dwells, and reigns in the souls of his people. Now though, as he hoped, this new man, new creature, or Christ, was formed in them before, when he first preached the Gospel to them; yet it was not a perfect man; particularly their knowledge of Christ, of his Gospel, and Gospel liberty, was far from being so, in which they went backwards instead of forwards; and therefore he was greatly concerned, laboured exceedingly, and vehemently endeavoured, which he calls travailing in birth again, to bring them to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. It is also the same as to be conformed to the image of Christ, which in regeneration is stamped upon the saints, and is gradually increased, and will be perfected in heaven; and that this might more manifestly appear, over which a veil was drawn, by their departure in any degree from the truths of the Gospel, was what he earnestly sought after: once more, it is the same as to have the form of Christ; that is, of the Gospel of Christ upon them, or to be cast into the form of doctrine, and mould of the Gospel, and to receive a Gospel impression and spirit from it; which is to have a spirit of liberty, in opposition to legal bondage; to live by faith on Christ, and not on the works of the law; to derive comfort alone from him, and not from any services and duties whatever; to have repentance, and the whole course of obedience, influenced by the grace of God, and love of Christ; and to be zealous of good works, and yet have no dependence on them for justification and salvation. This is what the apostle so earnestly desired, when, instead of it, these Galatians seemed to have the form of Moses, and of the law. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/galatians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>. This verse is not to be attached to the preceding (Bos, Bengel, Knapp, Lachmann, Rückert, Usteri, Schott, Ewald, Hofmann),—a construction which makes this earnest, touching address appear awkward and dissimilar in character to what is previously said,—but the words are to be separated from what precedes by a full stop, and to be joined with what follows, the tender affection of which is quite in harmony with this loving address. Difficulty has been felt as to <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-20.htm" title="I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.">Galatians 4:20</a> (which therefore is omitted in Chrysostom and some min.); but only from inattention to the Greek use of <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> after the address, when the writer turns to a new thought, and does so with a tacit antithesis, which is to be recognised from the context. It is found so not merely with questions (Hom. <span class="ital">Il</span>. xv. 244; Plat. <span class="ital">Legg</span>. x. p. 890 E; Xen. <span class="ital">Mem</span>. i. 3. 13, ii. 1. 26; Soph, <span class="ital">O. C</span>. 323. 1459), but also in other instances (Herod. 1. 115; Xen. <span class="ital">Anab</span>. v. 5. 13, vi. 6. 12). Here the slight antithetic reference lies, as the very repetition of <span class="greekheb">παρεῖναι πρὸς ὑμᾶς</span> indicates, in his glancing back to <span class="greekheb">καὶ μὴ μόνον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., namely: “Although zeal in a good cause ought not to be restricted merely to my presence with you, I yet would wish to be now present with you,” etc. The <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> <span class="ital">of the apodosis</span>, which Wieseler here assumes, is not suitable, because <span class="greekheb">ἤθελον δέ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. does not stand in any kind of antithesis to <span class="greekheb">τεκν</span>. <span class="greekheb">μου οὓς πάλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὠδίνω κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; and besides, no connected construction would result from it; for the idea: “<span class="ital">Because</span> ye are my children … I would wish,” does not correspond with the words. According to Hilgenfeld, that which the address is intended to introduce (viz. to move the readers to return) is wholly <span class="ital">suppressed</span>, and is supposed to be thereby the more strikingly suggested. Comp. also Reithmayr. But the affectionate tenor of the wish which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-20.htm" title="I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.">Galatians 4:20</a> harmonizes so fully with the tender address in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>, that that hypothesis, which Calvin also entertained (“hic quasi moerore exanimatus in medio sententiae tractu deficit”), does not seem warranted. Nevertheless Buttmann also, <span class="ital">neut. Gr</span>. p. 331, assumes an anacoluthon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τεκνία μου</span>] The word <span class="greekheb">τεκνία</span>, so frequent in <span class="ital">John</span>, is not found elsewhere in <span class="ital">Paul’s</span> writings. But Lachmann and Usteri ought not to have adopted (following B F G <span class="greekheb">א</span>*) the reading <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span>, since it is just in this passage, where Paul compares himself to a mother in childbirth, that the phrase “my little children” finds a more special motive and warrant than in any other passage where he uses <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-13.htm" title="Now for a recompense in the same, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged.">2 Corinthians 6:13</a> : comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm" title="This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on you, that you by them might war a good warfare;">1 Timothy 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-1.htm" title="You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 2:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὕς</span>] The well-known constructio <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σύνεσιν</span>.

Paul represents himself, not, as elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm" title="For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have you not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm" title="I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:">Philemon 1:10</a>), as a father, but in the special emotion of his love, as a mother who is in travail, and whose labour is not brought to an end (by the actual final birth) until nothing further is requisite for the full and mature formation of the <span class="greekheb">τεκνίον</span>. So long as this object is not attained, according to the figurative representation, the <span class="greekheb">ὠδίνειν</span> still continues.[207] Bengel remarks very correctly: “<span class="ital">Loquitur ut res fert</span>, nam in partu naturali formatio est <span class="ital">ante</span> dolores partus.” The <span class="ital">point of comparison</span> is the <span class="ital">loving exertion, which perseveres amidst trouble and pain in the effort to bring about the new Christian life</span>. This metaphorical <span class="greekheb">ὠδίνειν</span> had been on the first occasion easy and joyful, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm" title="You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.">Galatians 4:13</a> ff. (although it had not had the full and lasting result; see afterwards, on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΧΡΙς ΟὟ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>); but on this second occasion it was severe and painful, and on this account the word <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὨΔΊΝΩ</span></span></span> is chosen (and not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΊΚΤΩ</span></span></span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΕΝΝῶ</span></span></span>), which, however, is also appropriate to the earlier act of bearing intimated in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΛΙΝ</span></span></span>, since the idea of pains is essential to the conception of a birth, however slight and short they may be. The <span class="ital">sense</span>, when <span class="ital">stripped of figure</span>, is: “My beloved disciples! at whose conversion I am labouring for the second time with painful and loving exertion, until ye shall have become maturely-formed Christians.” This continuous <span class="greekheb">οὓς πάλιν ὠδίνω</span> is to be conceived as <span class="ital">begun</span>, so soon as Paul had learned the apostasy of his readers and had commenced to counteract it; so that his operations during his second visit (comp. <span class="greekheb">ἀληθεύων ὑμῖν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-16.htm" title="Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?">Galatians 4:16</a>) are thus also included: hence we cannot, with Fritzsche (<span class="ital">l.c</span>. p. 244) and Ulrich (in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.

According to Wieseler, <span class="greekheb">πάλιν ὠδίνω</span> is intended to express the idea of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΛΙΓΓΕΝΕΣΊΑ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>; Paul had regenerated his readers already at their conversion, and here says that he is <span class="ital">still continuously</span> occupied in their regeneration, until they should have attained the goal of perfection on the part of the Christian—similarity with Christ. This is incorrect, because <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> must necessarily denote a <span class="ital">second</span> act of travail on the part of <span class="ital">Paul</span>. Paul certainly effected the regeneration of his readers on occasion of the first <span class="greekheb">ὠδίνειν</span>, which is presupposed by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΛΙΝ</span></span></span>; but because they had relapsed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:">Galatians 1:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm" title="O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?">Galatians 3:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a> f., <span class="ital">et al</span>.), he must be <span class="ital">for the second time</span> in travail with them, and not merely <span class="ital">still continuously</span> (an idea which is not expressed) their <span class="ital">regenerator</span>, so that the idea of the <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>, the repetition, would be on the part of the <span class="ital">readers</span>. Theophylact (comp. Chrysostom) aptly defines the sense of <span class="greekheb">πάλιν ὠδίνω</span> not as that of a continued <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΑΓΈΝΝΗΣΙς</span></span></span>, but as that of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΛΙΝ ἙΤΈΡΑς ἈΝΑΓΕΝΝΉΣΕΩς</span></span></span>. The sense, “whose regeneration I am continuing,” would have been expressed by Paul in some such form as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὛς Οὐ ΠΑΎΟΜΑΙ ἈΝΑΓΕΝΝῶΝ</span></span></span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὛς ἜΤΙ ΚΑῚ ΝῦΝ ἈΝΑΓΕΝΝῶ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΧΡΙς ΟὟ ΜΟΡΦΩΘῇ ΧΡΙΣΤῸς ἘΝ ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span>] A <span class="ital">shadow</span> is thus thrown on the result of the <span class="ital">first</span> conversion (birth), which had undergone so sudden a change (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:">Galatians 1:6</a>). The reiterated labour of birth is not to cease until, etc. This meaning, and along with it the emphasis of the <span class="greekheb">ἄχρις οὗ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., has been missed by Hofmann, who, instead of referring <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΆΛΙΝ</span></span></span> to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὨΔΊΝΩ</span></span></span> only, extends it also to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΧΡΙς ΟὟ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> In connection with the general scope of the passage, however, the stress is on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΟΡΦΩΘῇ</span></span></span>: “until Christ shall have been <span class="ital">formed</span>, shall have attained His due conformation, in you,” that is, <span class="ital">until ye shall have attained to the fully-formed inner life of the Christian</span>. For the state of “Christ having been formed in man” is by no means realized “<span class="ital">so soon as a man becomes a Christian</span>” (Hofmann), but, as clearly appears from the notion of the <span class="greekheb">ἄχρις οὗ</span>, is the <span class="ital">goal of development</span> which the process of becoming Christian has to <span class="ital">reach</span>. When this goal is attained, the Christian is he <span class="ital">in whom Christ lives</span> (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>); as, for instance, on Paul himself the specific form of life of his Master was distinctly stamped. So long, therefore, as the Galatians were not yet developed and morally shaped into this complete inward frame, they were still like to an immature embryo, the internal parts of which have not yet acquired their normal shape, and which cannot therefore as yet come to the birth and so put an end to the <span class="greekheb">ὠδίνειν</span>.

All this, which is comprehended in the idea <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΡΙΣΤῸς ἘΝ ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span>, is in our passage rendered intelligible by the representation that Christ is to be <span class="ital">formed</span> in us, or to become present in the life-form corresponding to His nature.

But in this passage he is adopting the figure of a child-bearing mother; he is in travail for the spiritual birth of Christ within them (as he says), and straining all his powers to renew once more the spiritual life which had died in them until he could succeed in shaping their inner man afresh into the image of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>.

The objection to the latter arrangement, presented by the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> at the commencement of ver. 20, is thought by many to be obviated by a number of instances which have been alleged in which this conjunction is used with a sentence following a vocative compellation (see Alford, Ellicott). But such cases appear marked by a tone of vivacity and surprise which is not present here. On the other hand, the tone of loving affectionate anxiety breathing in this verse links it more closely with the preceding than with the following one, in which such pathos is no longer discernible, but is replaced by a deliberative attitude of mind. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs as a compellation here only in St. Paul's writings, though repeatedly in St. John's Epistle and once in his Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>), where it appears as used by our Lord in an access of deeply moved affectionate-ness. St. Paul addresses Timothy as "his child" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>, not only as a term of endearment, but as  denoting also his having been spiritually begotten by him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>). Here the like sense attaches to the word, as is clear from the following clause, "of whom I am again in travail;" but the diminutive form of the noun, agreeing well with the notion of a child at its birth, combines in this case apparently a tender allusion also to the extremely immature character of their Christian discipleship .(compare "babes (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) in Christ," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>) - so immature, in fact, that the apostle is travailing of them afresh, as if not yet born at all. This particular shade of meaning, however, must be sacrificed, if we accept the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "my children," which is highly authenticated. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> cannot be understood as pointing to gestation merely; it can only denote the pangs of parturition. The apostle by this figure describes himself as at this hour in an anguish of desire to bring the souls of his converts both to a complete <span class="accented">state</span> of sonship in Christ Jesus, and to a complete <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of that state - now at length bring them thereto, though that former travail had seemingly been in vain. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a> he refers to himself as a spiritual <span class="accented">father</span> of his converts, and this too with touching pathos. Great is the pathos too of his reference to himself as, in his fostering care of his Thessalonian converts, like a tender "nursing mother cherishing her own children," and also as of a "father" of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7, 11</a>). But neither of those passages equals the present in the expression of intense, even anguished, longing to effect, if only he might be able to effect it, a real transformation in the spiritual character of these Galatian converts. "Until" - I cannot rest till then! - "Christ be formed in you." The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, form, occurs only here in the New Testament in its uncompounded shape. A passage is cited from 'Const. Apost.,' 4:7, in which it occurs in the phrase, "formed man in the womb." In the Septuagint of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-22.htm">Exodus 21:22</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the unborn infant. It certainly seems as if the apostle used the word as one belonging to the same region of thought as the <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, but, with the like bold and plastic touch as elsewhere characterizes his use of imagery, refusing to be tied to thorough-going consisteney in its application. Compare for example <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2</a>. When the hour of <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is come, the period of the" formation" of the babe has expired. Further, as showing the freedom of the writer's use of imagery, the easiest way of taking <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is to suppose that "Christ" is here viewed as "<span class="accented">within"</span> them, and not as a likeness to which they are to be conformed: camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2.htm">Galatians 2</a>:22, "Christ liveth in me;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, where the "mystery" of the gospel is summed up in the words, "Christ in you the hope of glory." He cannot rest, he means, till the image, thought, of Christ as the Object of their sole and absolute trust, as the complete ground of their acceptance with God and their sonship, shall be perfectly and abidingly formed in their hearts. The hour in which a perfectly formed "Christ," that fair' Divine Child of joy and hope, has come to be there, in their hearts, will be the hour in which the apostle's travailing pangs have issued in their birth. No doubt the apostle is writing to persons baptized into Christ and thus clothed with Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>); persons, in the language of the Church, "born again." But however straitly <span class="accented">we</span> choose to be restrained in the use of such images, solidifying into rigid dogma similitudes used for such passing illustration as the occasion of the moment requires, the sacred writers themselves recognize no such restriction. As Chrysostom observes in his 'Commentary,' the apostle's language in effect is, "Ye need a fresh new-birth, a fresh remoulding (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)." Baptized into Christ as those Galatians were, they were, however, in his view no true sons of God, until Christ had been really formed in their hearts. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>My little children (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Only here in Paul, but often in John.
