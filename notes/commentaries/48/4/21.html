The same history had been already allegorically treated by Philo. The treatment of it by St. Paul is, however, quite different, and in keeping with the line of argument followed in the context.<p>The points of parallelism, which are drawn out in much detail, may be exhibited thus:—<p><span class= "ital">Jewish Church.</span><p><span class= "ital">Christian Church.</span><p>The bondwoman, Hagar.<p>The freewoman, Sarah.<p>Son of the bondwoman, Ishmael.<p>Son of the freewoman, Isaac.<p>Natural birth (the flesh).<p>Supernatural birth (the promise).<p>Mount Sinai.<p>Mount Zion.<p>The Law.<p>The Promise.<p>The earthly Jerusalem.<p>The heavenly Jerusalem.<p>Enslaved.<p>Free.<p>Fruitful.<p>Barren.<p>Small offspring.<p>Large offspring.<p>Persecuting.<p>Persecuted.<p>Expulsion.<p>Inheritance.<p><span class= "ital">The Jewish Church is enslaved.</span><p><span class= "ital">The Christian Church is free.</span><p>(21) <span class= "bld">Ye that desire to be under the law.</span>—A direct appeal to those who were inclined to give way to the Judaising party.<p><span class= "bld">Do ye not hear</span> <span class= "bld">the law?</span>—“Hear” is probably to be taken in the sense of “give heed to,” “listen to with attention,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-14.htm" title="And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when you depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.">Matthew 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-9.htm" title="Who has ears to hear, let him hear.">Matthew 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-13.htm" title="Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.">Matthew 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-29.htm" title="Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.">Luke 16:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-31.htm" title="And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.">Luke 16:31</a>.

For if the apostle made it evident, from the law of Moses itself, that Abraham’s children, by faith, were free from the bondage of the law, no further argument was necessary to prove that obedience to the law is not necessary to justification.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">It is written that Abraham had two sons </span>— Here he illustrates the doctrine of justification by faith, and of the abolition of the legal dispensation, by the history of Abraham’s family, in which it was prefigured. The plain import of what he advances is this: That as in Abraham’s family there were two mothers, and two sorts of children, which were differently treated; so, in the visible church, there are two sorts of professors; some that seek justification by the works of the law, who are in a servile and miserable condition, and shall at last be cast out from the presence of God, and the society of the saints; others that seek justification by faith in Christ, and in the promises of God through him: and these are the free sons of God’s family, and in a happy condition, and shall at last certainly obtain the inheritance of eternal life. <span class="ital">The one </span>— Namely, Ishmael, <span class="ital">by </span>Hagar, <span class="ital">a bond-maid, the other </span>— Namely, Isaac, <span class="ital">by </span>Sarah, <span class="ital">a free-woman.

These things are an allegory, wherein, beside the literal and historical sense of the words, the Spirit of God points out something further. Hagar and Sarah were apt emblems of the two different dispensations of the covenant. The heavenly Jerusalem, the true church from above, represented by Sarah, is in a state of freedom, and is the mother of all believers, who are born of the Holy Spirit. They were by regeneration and true faith, made a part of the true seed of Abraham, according to the promise made to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tell me ... - In order to show fully the nature and the effect of the Law, Paul here introduces an illustration from an important fact in the Jewish history. This allegory has given great perplexity to expositors, and, in some respects, it is attended with real difficulty. An examination of the difficulties will be found in the larger commentaries. My object, without examining the expositions which have been proposed, will be to state, in as few words as possible, the simple meaning and design of the allegory. The design it is not difficult to understand. It is to show the effect of being under the bondage or servitude of the Jewish law, compared with the freedom which the gospel imparts. Paul had addressed the Galatians as having a real desire to be under bondage, or to be servants; the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>. He had represented Christianity as a state of freedom, and Christians as the sons of God - not servants, but freemen.<p>To show the difference of the two conditions, he appeals to two cases which would furnish a striking illustration of them. The one was the case of Hagar and her son. The effect of bondage was well illustrated there. She and her son were treated with severity, and were cast out and persecuted. This was a fair illustration of bondage under the Law; of the servitude to the laws of Moses; and was a fit representation of Jerusalem as it was in the time of Paul. The other case was that of Isaac. He was the son of a free woman, and was treated accordingly. He was regarded as a son, not as a servant. And he was a fair illustration of the case of those who were made free by the gospel. They enjoyed a similar freedom and sonship, and should not seek a state of servitude or bondage. The condition of Isaac was a fit illustration of the New Jerusalem; the heavenly city; the true kingdom of God. But Paul does not mean to say, as I suppose, that the history of the son of Hagar and of the son of Rebecca was mere allegory, or that the narrative by Moses was designed to represent the different condition of those who were under the Law and under the gospel.<p>He uses it simply, as showing the difference between servitude and freedom, and as a striking illustration of the nature of the bondage to the Jewish law, and of the freedom of the gospel, just as anyone may use a striking historical fact to illustrate a principle. These general remarks will constitute the basis of my interpretation of this celebrated allegory. The expression "tell me," is one of affectionate remonstrance and reasoning; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-42.htm">Luke 7:42</a>, "Tell me, therefore, which of these will love him most?" Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, "Come, now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord."<p>Ye that desire to be under the law - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>. You who wish to yield obedience to the laws of Moses. You who maintain that conformity to those laws is necessary to justification.<p>Do ye not hear the law? - Do you not understand what the Law says? Will you not listen to its own admonitions, and the instruction which may be derived from the Law on the subject? The word "law" here refers not to the commands that were uttered on Mount Sinai, but to the book of the Law. The passage to which reference is made is in the Book of Genesis; but; all the five books of Moses were by the Jews classed under the general name of the Law; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>. The sense is, "Will you not listen to a narrative found in one of the books of the Law itself, fully illustrating the nature of that servitude which you wish?" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. desire&#8212;of your own accord madly courting that which must condemn and ruin you.<p>do ye not hear&#8212;do ye not consider the mystic sense of Moses' words? [Grotius]. The law itself sends you away from itself to Christ [Estius]. After having sufficiently maintained his point by argument, the apostle confirms and illustrates it by an inspired allegorical exposition of historical facts, containing in them general laws and types. Perhaps his reason for using allegory was to confute the Judaizers with their own weapons: subtle, mystical, allegorical interpretations, unauthorized by the Spirit, were their favorite arguments, as of the Rabbins in the synagogues. Compare the Jerusalem Talmud [Tractatu Succa, cap. Hechalil]. Paul meets them with an allegorical exposition, not the work of fancy, but sanctioned by the Holy Spirit. History, if properly understood contains in its complicated phenomena, simple and continually recurring divine laws. The history of the elect people, like their legal ordinances, had, besides the literal, a typical meaning (compare 1Co 10:1-4; 15:45, 47; Re 11:8). Just as the extra-ordinarily-born Isaac, the gift of grace according to promise, supplanted, beyond all human calculations, the naturally-born Ishmael, so the new theocratic race, the spiritual seed of Abraham by promise, the Gentile, as well as Jewish believers, were about to take the place of the natural seed, who had imagined that to them exclusively belonged the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law; </span> you that cannot be content to receive Jesus Christ alone, for justification; but have a mind to maintain a necessity of obedience to the law of circumcision, and other Judaical rites; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">do ye not hear the law, </span> that law which curseth every one who continueth not in all that is therein written to do it?

Not merely to obey it, as holy, just, and good, from a principle of love, and to testify subjection and gratitude to God; so all believers desire to bc under the law: but these men sought for justification and salvation by their obedience to it: they desired to be under it as a covenant of works, which was downright madness and folly to the last degree, since this was the way to come under the curse of it; they wanted to be under the yoke of the law, which is a yoke of bondage, an insupportable one, which the Jewish fathers could not bear; and therefore it was egregious weakness in them to desire to come under it: wherefore the apostle desires them to answer this question, <p>do ye not hear the law? meaning either the language and voice of the law of Moses, what it says to transgressors, and so to them; what it accused them of, and charged them with; how it declared them guilty before God, pronounced them accursed, and, ministered sententially condemnation and death unto them; and could they desire to be under such a law? or rather the books of the Old Testament, particularly the five books of Moses, and what is said therein; referring them, as Christ did the Jews, to the Scriptures, to the writings of Moses, and to read, hear, and observe what is in them, since they professed so great a regard to the law; from whence they might learn, that they ought not to be under the bondage and servitude of it. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "have ye not read the law?" and so one of Stephens's copies; that is, the books of the law; if you have, as you should, you might observe what follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Tell me, ye that <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</span><p>(6) The false apostles urged this, that unless the Gentiles were circumcised Christ could profit them nothing at all, and also this dissension of those who believed in the circumcision, against those who believed in the uncircumcision, both these things being full of offence. Therefore the apostle, after various arguments with which he has refuted their error, brings forth an allegory, in which he says that the Holy Spirit did through symbolism let us know all these mysteries: that is, that it should come to pass that two sorts of sons should have Abraham as a father common to them both, but not with equal success. For as Abraham begat Ishmael by the common course of nature, of Hagar his bondmaid and a stranger, and begat Isaac of Sara a free woman, by the virtue of the promise, and by grace only, the first was not heir, and also persecuted the heir. So there are two covenants, and as it were two sons born to Abraham by those two covenants, as it were by two mothers. The one was made in Sinai, outside of the land of promise, according to which covenant Abraham's children according to the flesh were begotten: that is, the Jews, who seek righteousness by that covenant, that is, by the Law. But they are not heirs, and they will at length be cast out of the house, as those that persecute the true heirs. The other was made in that high Jerusalem, or in Zion (that is, by the sacrifice of Christ) which begets children of promise, that is, believers, by the power of the Holy Spirit. And these children (like Abraham) do rest themselves in the free promise, and they alone by the right of children will be partakers of the father's inheritance, whereas those servants will be shut out.<p>(u) That desire so greatly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/galatians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-21.htm" title="Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, do you not hear the law?">Galatians 4:21</a>, without any connecting link, leads most energetically (<span class="greekheb">λέγετέ μοι</span>: “urget quasi praesens,” Bengel) at once <span class="ital">in mediam rem</span>.

Ishmael again, who had for some years filled the position of a son without the birthright which could entitle him to inherit the blessing, but was eventually driven out for his mockery of the promised child supplied an exact prototype of Israel after the flesh, long recognised as the people of God, but bound under the Law, and eventually destined to be shut out from the household of God for their guilt in persecuting Christ and His Church.—<span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νόμον οὐκ ἀκούετε</span>.

To <span class="ital">them</span> His words carried conviction or at least provoked no answer, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-47.htm" title="Woe to you! for you build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them....">Luke 11:47-48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/22-31.htm" title="But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,...">Matthew 22:31-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/22-41.htm" title="While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,...">Matthew 22:41-46</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">under the law</span>] perhaps ‘under (i.e. subject to) law’, legal observances, used in a wider and less definite sense than ‘<span class="ital">the</span> law’ which here refers to the Pentateuch. St Paul adopts the well-known Jewish division of the O.T. Scriptures, the Law (or Pentateuch), the Prophets, the Hagiographa (or rest of the sacred writings).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">do ye not hear</span>] Either ‘do ye not listen to its teaching?’ or ‘is it not read in your hearing?’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-21.htm" title="For Moses of old time has in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.">Acts 15:21</a>.

After the outburst of affectionate earnestness expressed in the last four verses, the apostle seems to have paused, reflecting in what way he could the most effectually convince these Galatian legalists of their error. At length, a consideration occurs to him, which he impetuously so to speak hastens to abruptly sot before them. He has before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>) shown to the Galatian believers that they were "Abraham's seed." He now means to show that, as children of Abraham through faith in Christ, they stood on a far higher footing than the children of the Sinai covenant did - a position which, by subjecting themselves afresh to the Law, they would forego. The verb "desire" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), as here introduced, intimates that this aspiration of theirs was a mere freak of self-will, there being nothing in the circumstances to prompt it. So in ver. 9, "Ye desire to be in bondage." In consequence of there being no article with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, some would render <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> "under Law," that is, Law viewed <span class="accented">in</span> g<span class="accented">enere</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>. But the whole scope of the Epistle resists this view. The apostle's contention with the Galatian perverters of the truth is not concerning Christians being subject to Law absolutely, but concerning their being subject to a Law of outward ceremonial observance; that is, to the Law of Moses; for there was no other system of positive ordinances by which, as of Divine authority, they could imagine themselves to be bound. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used without the article, like other <span class="accented">monadic</span> nouns with an understood specific reference (for examples, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as it is also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5, 6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Do ye not hear the Law?</span> (<span class="greek_word">to\n no/mon</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>;); <span class="accented">to that Law give ye no heed</span>?

There is no reason for attributing to the verb such a sense of listening to an <span class="accented">oral</span> utterance as should warrant us in supposing, that the apostle is thinking in particular of the Galatian Christians as in the habit of "hearing" the Pentateuch and ether Old Testament Scriptures read, whether in Jewish synagogues (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>) or in Christian assemblages. That such Scriptures in the Septuagint Version were customarily read aloud when Christians assembled for united worship, especially in the absence or dearth of other inspired writings, is more than probable: we know from Justin Martyr ('Apol.,' 1. p. 83) that such was the custom from Sunday to Sunday in his days, when there were <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> also available for such use. Moreover, the existence of such a custom helps us to understand how it was that the apostle could here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a>, presuppose with Christian believers an acquaintance with the contents of the Pentateuch. But we require more here than the thought, "Are ye not wont to hear the Law read?" It is rather an acquaintance with its contents, and taking due account of them, that he demands of his readers. Some uncial manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, read, instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. This reading of the text would only imply, not without a touch of sarcasm, the sense which the more accredited reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, may be understood as directly denoting. The use of the word "Law" to denote at once the system of  Mosaic legislation and the historical record in which it is embedded, is remarkable. The Jews were accustomed to designate the Pentateuch by this term (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>); and whoever would fain subject themselves to the positive enactments of the Mosaic Law as possessing Divine authority, would of course feel themselves bound also to accept the teaching of the historical record as clothed with the like authority. The apostle himself also accepted both as alike coming from God; only he required that the Divine purpose in both should be clearly understood and be suitably complied with. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Tell me<p>He plunges into the subject without introduction, and with a direct appeal.<p>Desire (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>Are bent on being under the law.
