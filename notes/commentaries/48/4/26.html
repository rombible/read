(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm" title="But you are come to mount Sion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,">Hebrews 12:22</a>, “Ye are come to . . . the heavenly Jerusalem;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>, “the holy city, new Jerusalem.” This “new” or “heavenly” Jerusalem is the seat or centre of the glorified Messianic kingdom, just as the old Jerusalem had been the centre of the earthly theocracy. The conception of the “heavenly Jerusalem” among the Jews, like the rest of their Messianic beliefs, took a materialistic form. It was to be a real but gorgeous city suspended in mid-air, “three parasangs” (11¼ miles) above the earthly city. Sometimes it is regarded as the exact copy of its earthly counterpart, and at other times as forming a perfect square. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm" title="And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.">Revelation 21:16</a>.) No such materialistic notions attach to the idea as presented by St. Paul. “Jerusalem which is above” is to him a spiritual city, of which the Christian is a member here and now. It is part of the Messianic kingdom, to the whole of which the Apostle gave an ideal character. He could not but do so, seeing that the kingdom began with the coming of its King, though there was no earthly and visible realisation of it. The Christian “conversation” (or, rather, <span class= "ital">commonwealth,</span> the constitution that he was under) was “in heaven,” while he himself was upon earth.

Hagar and Sarah were apt emblems of the two different dispensations of the covenant. The heavenly Jerusalem, the true church from above, represented by Sarah, is in a state of freedom, and is the mother of all believers, who are born of the Holy Spirit.

This Sarah was a type and figure of; she answered to, and agreed with this; which is to be understood, not of the church triumphant in heaven, but of the Gospel church state under the administration of the new covenant; and that, not as in the latter day glory, when the new Jerusalem shall descend from God out of heaven, but as it then was in the apostle's time, and has been since. Particular respect may be had to the first Gospel church at Jerusalem, which consisted of persons born from above, was blessed with a Gospel spirit, which is a spirit of liberty, out of which the Gospel went into all the world, and from among whom the apostles and first preachers of the word went forth everywhere, and were the means of the conversion of multitudes, both among Jews and Gentiles, and so might be truly said to be the mother of us all. The church in general, under the Gospel, may be, as it often is, called Jerusalem, because of its name, the vision of peace; being under the government of the Prince of peace; the members of it are sons of peace, who are called to peace, and enjoy it; the Gospel is the Gospel of peace, and the ordinances of it are paths of peace; and the new covenant, under the administration of which the saints are, is a covenant of peace. Jerusalem was the object of God's choice, the palace of the great King, the place of divine worship, was compact together, and well fortified: the Gospel church state consists of persons, who, in general, are the elect of God, among whom the Lord dwells, as in his temple. Here his worship is observed, his word is preached, and his ordinances administered; saints laid on the foundation, Christ, and being fitly framed together, grow up unto an holy temple in him, and are surrounded by him, as Jerusalem was with mountains, and are kept by his power unto salvation. This is said to be above, to distinguish it from the earthly Jerusalem, the inhabitants of which were chiefly men of the world, carnal men; but this heavenly Jerusalem, or Gospel church state, chiefly consists of persons born from above, called with an heavenly calling, and who bear the image of the heavenly one, whose conversation is in heaven, who are seeking things above, and in a little time will be there themselves; its constitution and form of government are from above, and so are its doctrines, and its ordinances. The Jews often Speak of <p>, or  or , "Jerusalem above" (x), as distinguished from Jerusalem below: and to this distinction the apostle seems to have respect here, who further says concerning this Jerusalem, that she <p>is free; from the servitude of sin, Satan, and the world, from the yoke of the law, and from a spirit of bondage; having the Spirit of God, the spirit of adoption, who is a free spirit, and makes such free that enjoy him; and where he is, there is true liberty. He adds, <p>which is the mother of us all; that are born again, whether Jews or Gentiles, as particularly the church at Jerusalem was, and the Gospel church state in general may be said to be; since here souls are born and brought forth to Christ, are nursed up at her side, and nourished with her breasts of consolation, the word and ordinances. This form of speech is also Jewish: thus it is said (y) that <p>"Zion, , "the mother of Israel", shall bring forth her sons, and Jerusalem shall receive the children of the captivity.'' <p>Again, explaining <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-24.htm">Proverbs 28:24</a> it is observed (z), that there is no father but the ever blessed God, , "and no mother" but the congregation of Israel. Some copies leave out the word "all"; and so do the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions, and only read, "the mother of us", or "our mother". <p>(x) Zohar in Gen. fol. 13. 2. &amp; 16. 2. &amp; 75. 4. &amp; 77. 1. &amp; 78. 2. &amp; 114. 3. &amp; 121. 1. &amp; in Exod. fol. 6. 1. &amp; 92. 2.

He leaves it, therefore, to the reader to supply the following thought: “But the other covenant, which is allegorically represented in this history, is the covenant instituted by Christ, which brings forth to freedom: this is Sarah, who is of the same nature with the upper Jerusalem; for the latter is, as Sarah was, free with its children, and to this upper Jerusalem we Christians as children belong.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ ἄνω Ἱερουσαλήμ</span>] is neither the <span class="ital">ancient</span> Jerusalem, the Salem of Melchizedek (Oeder, Michaelis, Paulus), nor <span class="ital">Mount Zion</span>, which is called in Josephus <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἄνω πόλις</span> (see the passages in Ottii <span class="ital">Spicil. ex Josepho</span>, p. 400 f.), as among the Greeks the Acropolis at Athens was also so named (Vitringa, Elsner, Mill, Wolf, Rambach, Moldenhauer, Zachariae). Both interpretations are opposed to the context, and the former to linguistic usage.[220] The contrast between heaven and earth elsewhere conveyed by <span class="greekheb">ἄνω</span>, as used by Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm" title="I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.">Php 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-2.htm" title=" Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.">Colossians 3:2</a>), is found here also, since <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ΝῦΝ ἹΕΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is the <span class="ital">earthly</span> Jerusalem.

And as previously the present Jerusalem represented the Jewish divine commonwealth, so here the upper Jerusalem represents the <span class="ital">Messianic theocracy</span>, which before the <span class="greekheb">παρουσία</span> is the <span class="ital">church</span>, and after the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span> is the glorious <span class="ital">kingdom of the Messiah</span>. With justice, accordingly, the church on earth (not merely the “ecclesia <span class="ital">triumphans</span>”) has at all times been deemed included in the heavenly Jerusalem (see Luther, and especially Calovius, <span class="ital">in loc</span>.); for the latter is, in relation to the church, its <span class="greekheb">πολίτευμα</span>, which is in heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Php 3:20</a>). The heavenly completion of the church in Christ ensues at the <span class="greekheb">παρουσία</span>, in which Christ who rules in heaven will manifest in glory the life—hitherto hidden with Him in God (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a> f.)—of the community, which is the body and <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> of Him its Head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a> f.). Thus the church on earth is already the theocracy of the heavenly Jerusalem, and has its <span class="greekheb">πολίτευμα</span> in heaven; but this its <span class="greekheb">κληρονομία</span> is, until the <span class="greekheb">παρουσία</span>, only an ideal and veiled, although in hope <span class="ital">assured</span>, possession, which at the second coming of the Lord at length attains objective and glorious realization. It is, however, by no means to be asserted that Paul entertained the sensuous Rabbinical conceptions of the heavenly Jerusalem (see Eisenmenger, entdeckt. Judenth. II. p. 839 ff.); for he nowhere presents, or even so much as hints, at them, often as he speaks of the <span class="greekheb">παρουσία</span> and the consequences connected with it.

The Psalms and Prophets attest the enthusiastic devotion of Israelites to the city of Jerusalem. Since the temple of God and the palace of the house of David were within its walls, it was at once the holy city round which clustered the religious feelings of Israel, and the city of the great king, of whom the royal house of David were representatives (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Psalms 48). The events of the captivity and restoration associated it still more intimately with the national fortunes and aspirations of Israel. Hence both Isaiah and Ezekiel invested it with ideal glory in their prophetic anticipations of the Messianic kingdom. Their visions of its future destiny looked forward to its becoming the centre of a world-wide worship: there the great King of all the earth would manifest His presence, and thither would flow all nations, offering their homage and bearing due tribute of gifts and sacrifices. But the Hebrew ideal scarcely rose above imaginations of an earthly city and a temple on the mountains of Israel. It was the function of Christian inspiration to spiritualise this conception, to eliminate its local association with the typical temple on earth, and to substitute a heavenly for an earthly city. The Apocalypse bears witness to the process of transition. Though it adheres closely to the vision of Ezekiel, and continues to employ material imagery for expressing the dazzling brightness and intense purity of the temple-city, yet the New Jerusalem is now seen coming down from heaven to a new earth; in place of earthly light it is illuminated by the light which emanates from the throne of God and of the Lamb; and material images are interpreted as symbols of moral beauty and spiritual holiness. The Epistle to the Hebrews views the heavenly Jerusalem from another side. Whereas the Apocalypse depicts its buildings, streets and rivers, the Epistle describes the throng of angels, the assembly of the first-born, the spirits of departed saints that are gathered there round the throne of God, and contrasts the awful majesty of the living God with the material terrors of Sinai. This Epistle presents the contrast between the earthly and the heavenly Jerusalem, and between the covenants of Sinai and of Christ in a different aspect. For the Apostle embodies in his conception a purely Greek ideal of a city, the mother and home of freemen. A self-governed body of free citizens, subject to no foreign control, but maintaining justice and order in perfect peace by their own sovereign will, furnishes him with an appropriate type of the heavenly commonwealth, whereof Christians are even now citizens, dwelling in peace together in the unity of Christian brotherhood, and independent of all restraints of law because they themselves do the will of God from the heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Hebrew form <span class="greekheb">Ἱερουσαλήμ</span> is naturally preferred to the Greek in all these passages, because Jerusalem is personified as an ideal city. The stress here laid on the freedom of Christ’s disciples recalls the conversation of Christ with the Jews in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-32.htm" title="And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.">John 8:32</a> … but the bondage is there more distinctly associated with actual sin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">the mother of us all</span>] Probably we should read with R.V. <span class="bld">our mother,</span> where of course ‘<span class="ital">our</span>’ is emphatic.

For the word "above," <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1, 2</a>, "Seek the things that are above (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>) where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God: set your mind on the things that are above; your life is hid with Christ in God;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>, "Our citizenship (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) is in heaven." This is identical with the "heavenly Jerusalem" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>, which, standing in contrast with the "mount that might be touched and that burned with fire," Sinai with its soul-crushing terrors, appears associated with the pacifying blood of Jesus, and with communion with all that is holiest and most glorious. The essential identity of the contrast in the two passages, which are mutually illustrative, bespeaks a common origin in one and the same mind. The supernal Jerusalem is not chiefly contrasted with the Jerusalem "that now is," in point of time: she is not the future only, though in the future to be <span class="accented">manifested -</span> the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down (as St. John writes) from God out of heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>); but she <span class="accented">is</span> there <span class="accented">now</span>, with God. It would be in harmony with St. Paul's representation to suppose that he conceives of her having been there with God in heaven of old, her citizens upon earth being the true servants of God in all ages. In former ages, however, she was comparatively barren; it needed that the enthronization of the God-Man, "the Mediator of the new covenant" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>), on "God's holy hill of Zion," should take place before she could become the prolific mother here shown to us. Commentators refer to rabbinical speculations relative to a Jerusalem which was conceived of as existing in heaven, as illustrated by Schottgen's 'Dissertatio de Hierosol. Caelesti' ('Hor. Hebr.,' vol. 1. diss. 5.), and also by Wetstein both here and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. It would be interesting if we could determine when those rabbinical speculations first arose, and how far it may be judged probable that they or some earlier form of them out of which these sprang suggested anything to St. Paul for the form in which he clothed his own conception of this idea; there may have been such. Meanwhile, we cannot but be struck by the purely ideal and spiritual character in which the apostle here exhibits his conception of it; though something like a terrene manifestation in the future seems indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>. "Is free;" the counterpart of Sarah, as mentioned in vers. 22, 23. That this Jerusalem is free, the apostle feels it needless to state; she to his very consciousness is the very home and bosom of God's love, having her  very existence, as well as her outward-acting power, in his pervading, actuating Spirit. Bondage, constraint, <span class="accented">there</span> cannot be; for all volitions are there harmonized, absorbed, by the Spirit of love uniting her component elements both with each other and with God. <span class="cmt_word">Which is the mother of us all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>]) <span class="accented">which is our mother.</span> Here again, as in ver. 24, <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> means "<span class="accented">which</span>, being such as she <span class="accented">is</span>, is our mother." We look at the Jerusalem that is above, and in her princely freedom we recognize what we her children are. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which the Textus Receptus has before <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and which is by the general consent of critics rejected, is with much probability supposed to have come into the text by the copyist's recollection of the similar sentence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-16.htm">Romans 4:16, 17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which there belongs to the essential thought of the context that God had made Abraham "the father of many nations," is unnecessary here, where the apostle is chiefly concerned with the freedom which characterizes the family of promise. If documentary evidence proved it to be genuine, it would find its justification in the notion of the fruitfulness which now at length, as the apostle presently shows, is given to the supernal Jerusalem. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Jerusalem which is above (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bc;)<p>Paul uses the Hebrew form &#x399;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bc; in preference to the Greek &#x399;&#788;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, which occurs <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>. The phrase Jerusalem which is above was familiar to the rabbinical teachers, who conceived the heavenly Jerusalem as the archetype of the earthly. On the establishment of Messiah's kingdom, the heavenly archetype would be let down to earth, and would be the capital of the messianic theocracy.
