For a fuller discussion see <span class= "ital">Excursus B</span> (p. 467).<p><span class= "bld">Answereth to Jerusalem which now is.</span>—The word for “answereth” is a technical term in philosophy, applied to the parallel columns containing such antithetical pairs as good—evil; one—many; finite—infinite, &c. Here it will be illustrated by the parallel arrangement of the different points of the allegory given above. “Answereth to” will thus mean “stands in the same column with.” Hagar, Sinai, the old covenant, the Jewish nation, or the earthly Jerusalem, all stand upon the same side of the antithesis. They are arranged one above another, or, in other words, <span class= "ital">they rank in the same line,</span> which is the primitive meaning of the word.<p><span class= "bld">Jerusalem which now is.</span>—<span class= "ital">The present Jerusalem</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the Jewish people still subject to the Law.

The words appear in no less than four different forms. Two of these, however, may be set aside at once. For the two that remain the authorities are nearly equally balanced. The simple reading “For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia” has in its favour the Sinaitic MS.; the Codex Ephraem; the Codex Augiensis, in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge; and another Dresden MS., which usually agrees with it, and seems to have been derived from the same copy; a good—perhaps the best—cursive; quotations in Origen and Epiphanius; and the Latin authorities generally. The other reading, “Now this Agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia,” is supported by the Vatican, Alexandrine, and Claromontane MSS., and by a fourth MS., now at Paris, which bears to the Claromontane a somewhat similar relation to that which the Dresden Codex bears to the Augiensis; a good cursive (somewhat inferior to that on the other side); and the Memphitic version. Balancing these authorities, the preponderance would seem—if we may venture to say so, where Dr. Lightfoot thinks differently—to be with the longer reading last mentioned. It is true that the list on the other side is more copious, and represents a wider diffusion of text; but, taking the two groups together, we believe that the second represents the older and purer form of text, and that its readings will be verified in the greater number of instances. It is indeed just that very group, headed by the Codex Sinaiticus, which comes in to mark the first stage of corruption—one of the very first and earliest forms of corruption, it is true, and one that is most nearly allied to the true text, but still a corruption and deviation from the original.<p>But if the external evidence bears in this direction, internal evidence would seem to confirm it. No doubt internal evidence is a treacherous and double-edged weapon, and it is very often as easy to turn it to one side as to the other. It has been quoted here in support of the shorter reading, and something, perhaps, is to be said for that view. Still, the simpler and more obvious considerations (which should be chiefly looked to) seem to tell rather decidedly the other way. The longer reading is much the more difficult; but it is one of the chief canons of internal evidence that the more difficult reading is to be preferred. It is also easy to see in the form of the Greek phrase what would induce an ignorant scribe to change, and by changing to simplify it. Or even failing this, there is never anything very forced in the hypothesis of an omission which is always one of the most natural of accidents.<p>The reading of the Received text (with the slight change of “now” instead of “for”) would seem, then, upon the whole, to be the more probable; and the next question would be, Assuming this reading, what sense is to be placed upon it? There is an Arabic word corresponding very nearly (though not quite) in sound to “Hagar,” with the meaning “stone.” Hence Chrysostom, in his exposition of this Epistle, assumes that St. Paul is playing upon this similarity of sound. He says that Sinai “is so called (or <span class= "ital">translated</span>) in the native tongue” of the Arabs, and he speaks of the mountain as “bearing the same name with the bondmaid.” This statement of Chrysostom does not appear to have received much independent corroboration, though one traveller (Harant), in the sixteenth century, makes the same assertion. Still, even if Sinai were <span class= "ital">not</span> called in a special sense “<span class= "ital">the</span> stone” or “rock,” the identity of the Arabic word for “rock” <span class= "ital">might possibly</span> have suggested to St. Paul a play on words so very much in his style. “The very word Hagar,” we may imagine him arguing, “itself the name for ‘rock,’ suggests the propriety of the analogy which I am applying. It points to the parallel between the stem and relentless legislation of Sinai and the history of Hagar the bondwoman and her son, who persecuted the child of promise.” The literary methods of the present day are different, and such an explanation will seem far-fetched. It may be thought a conclusive argument against it that, whether St. Paul himself knew the Arabic signification of “Hagar” or not, he could not expect a Celtic people like the Galatians to know it. But even this argument is less conclusive when applied to one who is so fond of following the course of his own thought as St. Paul. And yet it must be admitted that there are too many elements of uncertainly for the explanation to be pressed at all strongly: it must remain a possibility—not more. On the other hand, even if it should break down, it would not necessarily follow that the reading would have to be abandoned—it would only lose something of its point. We should then have simply an assertion where otherwise there would be also an argument. “This Hagar—the Hagar of which I am speaking—stands for Mount Sinai which is in Arabia, the country of Hagar. The scene of the Mosaic legislation was part of the domains of the Ishmaelites, the children of Hagar, so that the two may very well be compared.” This interpretation has the authority of Theodore of Mopsuestia and Theodoret, and it is, perhaps, the safest to fall back upon. At the same time there may be something of the additional point which Chrysostom and those who have followed him in modern times have supposed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-25.htm" title="For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children....">Galatians 4:25-27</a></span>. <span class="ital">For this Agar is mount Sinai — </span>That is, is a type of that mount.

These things are an allegory, wherein, beside the literal and historical sense of the words, the Spirit of God points out something further. Hagar and Sarah were apt emblems of the two different dispensations of the covenant. The heavenly Jerusalem, the true church from above, represented by Sarah, is in a state of freedom, and is the mother of all believers, who are born of the Holy Spirit.

No one can believe that Paul meant to say that Hagar was literally Mount Sinai. A great deal of perplexity has been felt in regard to this passage, and Bentley proposed to cancel it altogether as an interpolation. But there is no good authority for this. Several manuscripts and versions read it, "For this Sinai is a mountain in Arabia;" others, "to this Hagar Jerusalem answereth," etc. Griesbach has placed these readings in the margin, and has marked them as not to be rejected as certainly false, but as worthy of a more attentive examination; as sustained by some plausible arguments, though not in the whole satisfactory. The word Hagar in Arabic is said to signify a rock; and it has been supposed that the name was appropriately given to Mount Sinai, because it was a pile of rocks, and that Paul had allusion to this meaning of the word here. So Chandler, Rosenmuller, and others interpret it. But I cannot find in Castell or Gesenius that the word Hagar in Arabic has this signification; still less is there evidence that the name was ever given to Mount Sinai by the Arabs, or that such a signification was known to Paul. The plainest and most obvious sense of a passage is generally the true sense; and the obvious sense here is, that Hagar was a fair representation of Mount Sinai, and of the Law given there.<p>In Arabia - Mount Sinai is situated in Arabia Petraea, or the Rocky. Rosenmuller says that this means "in the Arabic language;" but probably in this interpretation he stands alone.<p>And answereth to Jerusalem - Margin, "Is in the same rank with." The margin is the better translation. The meaning is, it is just like it, or corresponds with it. Jerusalem as it is now (that is, in the days of Paul), is like Mount Sinai. It is subject to laws, and rites, and customs; bound by a state of servitude, and fear, and trembling, such as existed when the Law was given on Mount Sinai. There is no freedom; there are no great and liberal views; there is none of the liberty which the gospel imparts to men. The word &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;  sustoichei, "answereth to," means properly to advance in order together; to go together with, as soldiers march along in the same rank; and then to correspond to. It means here that Mount Sinai and Jerusalem as it then was would be suited to march together in the same platoon or rank. In marshalling an army, care is taken to place soldiers of the same height, and size, and skill, and courage, if possible, together. So here it means that they were alike. Both were connected with bondage, like Hagar. On the one, a law was given that led to bondage; and the other was in fact under a miserable servitude of rites and forms.<p>Which now is - As it exists now; that is, a slave to rites and forms, as it was in fact in the time of Paul.<p>And is in bondage - To laws and customs. She was under hard and oppressive rites, like slavery. She was also in bondage to sin <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33-34</a>; but this does not seem to be the idea here.<p>With her children - Her inhabitants. She is represented as a mother, and her inhabitants, the Jews, are in the condition of the son of Hagar.

Translate, "For this word, Hagar, is (imports) Mount Sinai in Arabia (that is, among the Arabians&#8212;in the Arabian tongue)." So Chrysostom explains. Haraut, the traveller, says that to this day the Arabians call Sinai, "Hadschar," that is, Hagar, meaning a rock or stone. Hagar twice fled into the desert of Arabia (Ge 16:1-16; 21:9-21): from her the mountain and city took its name, and the people were called Hagarenes. Sinai, with its rugged rocks, far removed from the promised land, was well suited to represent the law which inspires with terror, and the spirit of bondage.<p>answereth&#8212;literally, "stands in the same rank with"; "she corresponds to."<p>Jerusalem which now is&#8212;that is, the Jerusalem of the Jews, having only a present temporary existence, in contrast with the spiritual Jerusalem of the Gospel, which in germ, under the form of the promise, existed ages before, and shall be for ever in ages to come.<p>and&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read, "For she is in bondage." As Hagar was in bondage to her mistress, so Jerusalem that now is, is in bondage to the law, and also to the Romans: her civil state thus being in accordance with her spiritual state [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/galatians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Agar, </span> the bondwoman, fitly represented <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Mount Sinai, </span> the mountain in Arabia, from which the law was given: and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jerusalem which now is</span> answereth to Mount Sinai; for as in Mount Sinai the law was given in a terrible manner, so now Jerusalem is the seat of the scribes and Pharisees, who are the doctors of that law, and rigidly press the observation of it, by which the Jews are kept <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in bondage.</span> The apostle speaketh not here of the civil servitude that the Jews were in under the Romans, to whom they were now tributaries, but of that religious servitude in which the scribes and Pharisees kept them to their legal services. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/galatians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For this Agar is Mount Sinai in Arabia,.... The Arabic version, instead of Arabia, reads "Balca". The Syriac version makes Hagar to be a mountain, reading the words thus, "for Mount Hagar is Sinai, which is in Arabia": and some have been of opinion that Sinai was called Hagar by the Arabians. It is certain, that  which may be pronounced Hagar, does signify in the Arabic language a stone or rock; and that one part of Arabia is called Arabia Petraea, from the rockiness of it; the metropolis of which was  or "Agara", and the inhabitants Agarenes; and Hagar was the name of the chief city of Bahrein, a province of Arabia (r): and it may be observed, that when Hagar, with her son, was cast out, they dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-21.htm">Genesis 21:21</a> which was near to Sinai, as appears from <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a> so that it is possible that this mount might be so called from her, though there is no certainty of it; and near to it, as Grotius observes, was a town called Agra, mentioned by Pliny (s) as in Arabia. However, it is clear, that Sinai was in Arabia, out of the land of promise, where the law was given, and seems to be mentioned by the apostle with this view, that it might be observed, and teach us that the inheritance is not of the law. It is placed by Jerom (t) in the land of Midian; and it is certain it must be near it, if not in it, as is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>. And according to Philo the Jew (u), the Midianites, as formerly called, were a very populous nation of the Arabians: and Madian, or Midian, is by (w) Mahomet spoken of as in Arabia; and it may be observed, that they that are called Midianites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a> are said to be Ishmaelites, <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1</a> the name by which the Arabians are commonly called by the Jews. The apostle therefore properly places this mountain in Arabia. But after all, by Agar, I rather think the woman is meant: and that the sense is, that this same Agar signifies Mount Sinai, or is a figure of the law given on that mount. <p>And answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children; that is, agrees with and resembles the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of all the cities and towns in Judea; and she, being a bondwoman, represented that state of bondage the Jews were in, when the apostle wrote this, who were in a state of civil, moral, and legal bondage; in civil bondage to the Romans, being tributaries to the empire of Rome, and under the jurisdiction of Caesar; in moral bondage to sin, to Satan, to the world and the lusts of it, whose servants they in general were; and in legal bondage to the ceremonial law, which was a yoke of bondage: they were in bondage under the elements or institutions of it, such as circumcision, a yoke which neither they, nor their forefathers could bear, because it bound them over to keep the whole law; the observance of various days, months, times, and years, and the multitude of sacrifices they were obliged to offer, which yet could not take away sin, nor free their consciences from the load of guilt, but were as an handwriting of ordinances against them; every sacrifice they brought declaring their sin and guilt, and that they deserved to die as the creature did that was sacrificed for them; and besides, this law of commandments, in various instances, the breach of it was punishable with death, through fear of which they were all their life long subject to bondage: they were also in bondage to the moral law, which required perfect obedience of them, but gave them no strength to perform; showed them their sin and misery, but not their remedy; demanded a complete righteousness, but did not point out where it was to be had; it spoke not one word of peace and comfort, but all the reverse; it admitted of no repentance; it accused of sin, pronounced guilty on account of it, cursed, condemned, and threatened with death for it, all which kept them in continual bondage: and whereas the far greater part of that people at that time, the Jerusalem that then was, the Scribes, Pharisees, and generality of the nation, were seeking for justification by the works of the law, this added to their bondage; they obeyed it with mercenary views, and not from love but fear; and their comforts and peace rose and fell according to their obedience; and persons in such a way must needs be under a spiritual bondage. <p>(r) Castel.

Beza, Calvin, Castalio, Estius, Wolff, and others, interpret, <span class="ital">“for Hagar is a type of Mount Sinai in Arabia;</span>”[216] but against this view the neuter <span class="greekheb">τὸ Ἄγαρ</span> is decisive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἈΡΑΒΊᾼ</span></span></span>] not <span class="ital">in Arabia situm</span> (Schott and older expositors)—for how idle would be this topographical remark[217] in the case of a mountain so universally known!—nor equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἀραβιστί</span>, so that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΡΑΒ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> would be an adjective and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΑΛΈΚΤῼ</span></span></span> would have to be supplied (Matthias); but: in <span class="ital">Arabia</span> the name <span class="ital">Hagar</span> signifies the Mount <span class="ital">Sinai</span>.[218] So Chrysostom, Theophylact, Luther (“<span class="ital">for Agar means in Arabia the Mount Sinai</span>”), Morus, Koppe, Reiche, Reithmayr, and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συστοιχεῖ</span>] The <span class="ital">subject</span> is, as Theodore of Mopsuestia rightly has it, <span class="ital">Hagar</span>, not <span class="ital">Mount Sinai</span> (Vulgate, Jerome, Ambrose, Chrysostom and his followers, Thomas, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, Estius, Wolf, Bengel, and others; also Hofmann now),—a view which runs entirely counter to the context, according to which the two <span class="ital">women</span> are the subjects of the allegorical interpretation, while <span class="greekheb">τὸ γὰρ Ἄγαρ Σινᾶ ὄρος ἐστιν ἐν τῇ Ἀραβ</span>. was merely a collateral remark by way of confirmation. Incorrectly also Studer and Usteri, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius (also Hofmann formerly), Windischmann, Reithmayr, hold that the subject is still <span class="greekheb">μία μὲν ἀπὸ ὄρους Σινᾶ</span>, <span class="ital">the Sinaitic constitution</span>. In this way there would be brought out no <span class="ital">comparison</span> at all between the subject of <span class="greekheb">συστοιχεῖ</span> and the present Jerusalem; and yet such, according to the signification of <span class="greekheb">συστοιχεῖν</span> (see afterwards), there must necessarily be, so that in <span class="greekheb">δουλεύει γάρ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. lies the <span class="ital">tertium comparationis</span>. The Sinaitic <span class="greekheb">διαθήκη</span> is not of a <span class="ital">similar nature</span> with the present Jerusalem, but is itself the constitution of it; on that very account, however, according to the allegorical comparison <span class="ital">Hagar</span> corresponds to the present Jerusalem. <span class="greekheb">συστοιχεῖν</span> means <span class="ital">to stand in the same row</span> (see Polyb. x. 21. 7, and Wetstein); that is, here, to stand in the same <span class="ital">category</span> (<span class="greekheb">συστοιχία</span>, Aristot. <span class="ital">Metaph</span>. i. 5, pp. 986, 1004), to be of the same <span class="ital">nature and species</span>, <span class="greekheb">σύστοιχον εἶναι</span> (Theophr. <span class="ital">c. pl</span>. vi. 4. 2; Arist. <span class="ital">Meteor</span>, i. 3; Lucian, <span class="ital">q. hist. conscr</span>. 43). Consequently: <span class="ital">Hagar belongs to the same category with the present Jerusalem</span>, is of a like nature with it (comp. Polyb. xiii. 8. Galatians 1 : <span class="greekheb">ὅμοια καὶ σύστοιχα</span>), has in common with it the same characteristic relation, in so far namely that, as Hagar was a bond-woman, the present Jerusalem with its children is also in bondage. See below. Thus <span class="greekheb">συστ</span>. expresses the <span class="ital">correspondence</span>. But it is incorrect to take it as: <span class="ital">she confronts as parallel</span> (Rückert, Winer).[219] This must have been expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἀντιστοιχεῖ</span> (Xen. <span class="ital">Symp</span>. 2. 20, <span class="ital">Anab</span>. v. 4. 12; comp. <span class="greekheb">ἀντίστοιχος</span>, Eur. <span class="ital">Andr</span>. 746, and <span class="greekheb">ἀντιστοιχία</span>, Plut. <span class="ital">Mor</span>. p. 474 A). Many of those who regard Sinai as the subject (see above) interpret: “<span class="ital">it extends as far as Jerusalem</span>” (Vulgate, Jerome, Ambrose, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Wolf, and others). This would have to be more exactly defined with Genebrardus, <span class="ital">ad</span> <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-3.htm" title="As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended on the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for ever more.">Psalm 133:3</a></span>, following out the literal meaning of the word <span class="greekheb">συστοιχεῖ</span>: “<span class="ital">perpetuo dorso sese versus Sionis montes exporrigit</span>.” But even granting the geographical reality of the description, and setting aside the fact that Sinai is not the subject, Paul must have named, instead of <span class="greekheb">τῇ νῦν Ἱερονσ</span>., <span class="ital">Mount Zion</span>. Hofmann, in reference to the position of Sinai in Arabia and of Jerusalem in the land of promise, interprets the expression <span class="ital">locally</span> indeed, but as indicative of the <span class="ital">non-local</span> relation, that the present Jerusalem belongs to the same category with the mountain although Arabian, which has it side by side <span class="ital">on the same line in the order of the history of salvation</span>. An artificial consequence of the geographical contrast introduced as regards <span class="greekheb">ἐν Ἀραβ</span>., as well as of the erroneous assumption that Mount Sinai is the subject. At the same time a turn is given to the interpretation, as if Paul had written <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΣΤΟΙΧΕῖ ΔῈ ΑὐΤῷ Ἡ ΝῦΝ ἹΕΡΟΥΣ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῇ ΝῦΝ ἹΕΡΟΥΣΑΛΉΜ</span></span></span>] does not stand in contrast to the <span class="ital">former Salem</span> (Erasmus, Michaelis), but in Paul’s view means the present Jerusalem <span class="ital">belonging to the pre-Messianic period</span>, as opposed to <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἄνω Ἱερουσ</span>. (ver 26), which after the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΟΥΣΊΑ</span></span></span> will take its place. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-26.htm" title="But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.">Galatians 4:26</a>. Moreover, the present Jerusalem and its children (“<span class="ital">inhabitants;</span>” see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets, and stone them which are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!">Matthew 23:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-2.htm" title="Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.">Psalm 149:2</a>) represent <span class="ital">the Israelitic commonwealth and its members</span>.

The bondage <span class="ital">to Rome</span> (Pelagius) is not, according to the context, referred to either alone (Castalio, Ewald) or <span class="ital">jointly</span> (Bengel). The subject is <span class="greekheb">ἡ νῦν Ἱερουσ</span>., and not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΓΑΡ</span></span></span> (Cornelius a Lapide, Grotius, and others). Looking at the usage both of classical authors and the N.T., there is nothing surprising in the <span class="ital">change</span> of subject (Stallbaum, <span class="ital">ad Plat. Gorg</span>. p. 510 C; Winer, p. 586 [E. T. 787 f.]). Lachmann (also Ewald) has incorrectly placed the words <span class="greekheb">δουλεύει</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτῆς</span> in a parenthesis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[214] We may add that جر occurs elsewhere as a geographical proper name in Arabia Petraea. Thus the Chald. Paraphr. always gives the name חגרא to the wilderness called in the Hebr. שׁוּר. As to the town جر, which is, however, to be pronounced Hidschr and not Hadschr, and, on account of its too remote site, cannot come into consideration here (in opposition to Grotius and others), see Ewald, p. 493 f., and Jahrb. VIII. p. 290.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[215] As to the mineralogical beauty of the mountain, see Fraas, <span class="ital">Aus d. Orient geolog.

But this Paul <span class="ital">has not</span> said; the substance of it would have to be read <span class="ital">between</span> the lines. How very natural it would have been for him at least to have written, instead of or in addition to <span class="greekheb">ἑν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀραβ</span>., <span class="greekheb">ἴξω</span> (or <span class="greekheb">μακρὰν ἀπό</span>) <span class="greekheb">τῆς γῆς Χαναάν</span>, in order thus at least to give some intimation that the <span class="ital">alien character</span> was the <span class="ital">point!</span> This also applies against the view of Hofmann (comp. also his <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 70 f.), who likewise follows the reading omitting <span class="greekheb">Ἄγαρ</span>, and agrees in substance with Wieseler’s explanation, taking Mount Sinai as contrast to Sion, and Arabia as contrast to the land of promise. Comp. also, in opposition to this exposition, which imports elements wholly gratuitous, Ewald, <span class="ital">Jahrb</span>. X. p. 239.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[217] Which is not (with Bengel) to be brought into an antithetical relation to <span class="greekheb">συστοιχεῖ δέ</span> (<span class="ital">the Mount Sinai is indeed situated in Arabia, but corresponds</span>, etc.), as if it were accompanied by a <span class="greekheb">μέν</span> (and with the adoption of Lachmann’s reading); for in this case the allegorical signification of the <span class="ital">Hagar</span> would not be based on any ground.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[218] Observe that the apostle does not at all wish to say that <span class="ital">Hagar</span> is <span class="ital">in the Arabic language generally</span> the name of Sinai; but, on the contrary, by <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ Ἀραβίᾳ</span>, he characterizes that name as a <span class="ital">name used in the country, provincial</span>.

This view is not to be supported by Polyb. x. 21. 7, where <span class="greekheb">συζυγοῦντας καὶ συστοιχοῦντας διαμένειν</span> means to <span class="ital">remain in rank and file</span> (“servare ordines secundum <span class="greekheb">παραστάτας</span> et <span class="greekheb">ἐπιβάτας</span>,” Schweighäuser), so that as well the <span class="greekheb">συζυγοῦντες</span> as the <span class="greekheb">συστοιχοῦντες</span> always form <span class="ital">one</span> row with one another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Note</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If the reading of Bengel and Lachmann, <span class="greekheb">τὸ γ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Σινᾶ ὄρος ἐστὶν ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀραβ</span>., be adopted, the interpretation would simply be: “<span class="ital">for the Sinai-Mount is in Arabia;</span>” so that <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ Ἀραβ</span>. would serve to support the allegorical relation of Hagar to Sinai, seeing that Hagar also was <span class="ital">in Arabia</span> and the ancestress of the Arabians. This certainly forms a ground of support much too vague, and not befitting the dialectic acuteness of the apostle. In the case of the <span class="ital">Recepta</span> also, <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ Ἀραβ</span>., taken as a <span class="ital">geographical</span> notice, is so superfluous and aimless, that Schott’s uncritical conjecture, treating the words <span class="greekheb">τὸ γ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἄγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὄρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Σ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀραβ</span>. as a double gloss, is not surprising.

The variety of readings in the MSS., <span class="greekheb">το Αγαρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">το γαρ Αγαρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">το δε Αγαρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">το γαρ</span>, indicates some primitive error of transcription. It is hardly possible to extract any reasonable sense from the three first: for <span class="greekheb">τὸ Ἅγαρ</span> cannot mean Hagar herself: it denotes the name Hagar, and Stanley’s attempt to connect this name with Sinai proved futile. How then can the statement be understood that the name Hagar is Sinai, or that it answers to Jerusalem? How again can the superfluous description of Sinai as a mountain in Arabia be explained? Moreover, the reading <span class="greekheb">τὸ Ἅγαρ</span> without any connecting particle is intolerable in Greek language, and <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> or <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> was probably added to correct the solecism. Hence I conclude that <span class="greekheb">Ἅγαρ</span> was probably an error in transcription for the original <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, suggested by its occurrence immediately before.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The statement in the text on the contrary, <span class="ital">For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia</span>, is full of meaning when it is remembered that Hagar had no connection with Sinai itself, but that she found a home for herself and her children in Arabia.—<span class="greekheb">συστοιχεῖ</span>. The previous clause <span class="greekheb">τὸ γὰρ</span> … <span class="greekheb">Ἀραβίᾳ</span> is a parenthesis, <span class="greekheb">ἥτις</span> is therefore the subject of <span class="greekheb">συστοιχεῖ</span>. The Apostle finds in the actual state of Jerusalem and her children the same characteristic feature of slavery as in the covenant of Sinai.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. The reading, the construction and the meaning of the first clause of this verse are uncertain, and have afforded matter for considerable discussion. The genuineness of the word ‘Hagar’ is doubtful. If it is retained, the sense will be, ‘For (or, as some copies read, ‘now’) this term Hagar is the name by which Mount Sinai is called in Arabia’, it therefore represents Mount Sinai, which is in Arabia, the country to which Hagar fled and which her descendants inhabit. ‘The word Hagar in Arabic means “a rock”, and some authorities tell us that Mount Sinai is so called by the Arabs’. Conybeare and Howson. But it is better to omit it, and the sense will then be, ‘For Mount Sinai is in Arabia’, the country of Ishmael’s descendants, the offspring of the <span class="ital">bondwoman</span>. In any case the clause is parenthetical, and the following words refer to Hagar in the preceding verse:—‘and this is Hagar (for Mount Sinai is situated in Arabia—the country of the Ishmaelites) and it (the covenant) corresponds to Jerusalem &c.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and answereth</span>] ‘belongs to the same row or category, corresponds to’, see note <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-22.htm" title="For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a female slave, the other by a free woman.">Galatians 4:22</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jerusalem which now is</span>] Here, from the addition of the phrase ‘with her children’ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets, and stone them which are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!">Matthew 23:37</a>), it is evident that Jerusalem stands for the whole Jewish people, nationally considered. It is contrasted not, as might have been expected, with ‘Jerusalem <span class="ital">which shall be</span>’, but with ‘Jerusalem which is from above’; but the antithesis is not weakened. The Heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>) is the same as the ‘<span class="ital">new</span> Jerusalem’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm" title="And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.">Revelation 21:2</a>) of the prophetic vision, which is even now the city and the home of every true believer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Php 3:20</a>). It is in heaven (or above) until the number of God’s elect shall be accomplished, and then it will ‘come down from God out of heaven’, not like a bondwoman and an outcast, but ‘as a bride adorned for her husband’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and is in bondage</span>] The reference is probably to the legal bondage to which every Jew, <span class="ital">as such</span>, was subject.

Thus the introduction of <span class="ital">Hagar</span> in this section stands on a clear and well-defined footing.

Some consider these words, <span class="greekheb">Σινᾶ ὄρος ἐστὶν ἐν τῇ Ἀραβίᾳ</span>, which are found in all the copies, as a gloss; but they are wrong. For thus Paul’s argument is weakened, when he brings forward the bondage engendered from Mount Sinai [as answering] to that of Jerusalem, which now is; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-24.htm" title="Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which engenders to bondage, which is Agar....">Galatians 4:24-25</a>.

The former (Hagar) had a son, but the latter (Jerusalem) had <span class="ital">sons</span>. These remarks relate to the whole passage; we shall now observe some things on each portion in detail.—<span class="greekheb">Σινᾶ ὄρος</span>, <span class="ital">Sinai, a mountain</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-24.htm" title="Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which engenders to bondage, which is Agar.">Galatians 4:24</a> has <span class="ital">from the Mount Sinai;</span> now the order of the words is changed [<span class="ital">Sinai</span> going before <span class="ital">mount</span> here; but <span class="ital">mount</span> before Sinai in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-24.htm" title="Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which engenders to bondage, which is Agar.">Galatians 4:24</a>] (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>, note). In the former passage, more regard is had to the <span class="ital">mountain</span>, inasmuch as it was upon it that the law was given, whatever name it might have [the name <span class="ital">Sinai</span> not being taken into account there]; afterwards, it is rather considered as <span class="ital">Sinai</span> [the name <span class="ital">Sinai</span> being the prominent idea], a mountain in Arabia.—<span class="greekheb">συστοιχεῖ δὲ</span>) <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">and yet</span> [<span class="ital">but</span>], although it is in Arabia; <span class="greekheb">συστοιχεῖν</span> is used of that which agrees with something else in a comparison. This agreement is evident in itself, for it is one and the same people that received the law on Mount Sinai, and that inhabit the city of Jerusalem; and the people at both periods stand on the same footing.[41] It is to be added, that Sinai and Jerusalem were nearly under the same meridian, and were united with slight interruption almost by the same chain of mountains.—<span class="greekheb">τῇ νῦν</span>, <span class="ital">that now is</span>) The antithesis is, <span class="ital">that is above</span>.—<span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>, now, refers to time, <span class="ital">above</span> to place; the antithesis of either must be supplied from the other in the semiduplex[42] oratio.

The expression, <span class="ital">which is above</span>, is said with the greater propriety on this account, that it alludes to the higher and nobler part of Jerusalem, and <span class="ital">rises above Mount</span> Sinai: and the Jerusalem which is above, inasmuch as she is already our <span class="ital">mother</span>, could not be suitably spoken of as <span class="ital">future</span> [as that <span class="ital">which is about to be</span>, in antithesis to the Jerusalem <span class="ital">that now is</span>]; not only is she <span class="ital">future</span> [“about to be,” as regards the future], but also more ancient [as regards the past], than <span class="greekheb">ἡ νῦν</span>, [the Jerusalem] <span class="ital">which now is</span>, inasmuch as the latter has not existed for a long period, nor will it exist in time to come.—<span class="greekheb">δουλεύει</span>, <span class="ital">is in bondage</span>) As Hagar was in bondage to her mistress, so Jerusalem, that now is, is in bondage to the law, and also to the Romans,—her civil state thus being in accordance with her spiritual state.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[40] <span class="ital">Hence the omission of the word</span> “<span class="greekheb">Αγαρ</span> <span class="ital">in this verse, not so much approved of on the margin of the larger</span> Ed., <span class="ital">is reckoned among the fixed readings by the margin</span> of the 2d Ed., <span class="ital">in which</span> the Germ.

This clause has been the subject of much conflicting opinion. The reading of the Greek text is itself much debated, and in the original authorities (manuscripts, versions, and Fathers) it appears in a great variety of forms. A detailed discussion of the latter point would be out of place here; and for the premisses from which the critical judgment is to be drawn, the reader is referred to Alford, and to a detached note which Bishop Lightfoot adds in his ' Commentary,' at the end of this fourth chapter. Only the main result needs to be stated. There are two forms of the text, between which the choice lies. One is that of the  Textus Receptus, namely, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>," For the <span class="accented">word</span> Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia." This is maintained by Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, and San-day. The other, omitting the word <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>, runs thus: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "<span class="accented">For</span> Sinai is a mountain in Arabia." This is accepted by Bentley, Lachmann, Tregelles, Tischendorf (latterly), Bengel, De Wette, Windischmann, Howson, and Lightfoot. In respect to the original authorities, there is not generally thought to exist any <span class="accented">great</span> preponderance in the evidence for either the retention or the omission of the word "<span class="accented">Hagar."</span> The decision, therefore, depends chiefly upon a comparison of the internal probabilities. In order to this, we must gain as clear a view as we can of the meaning of the above two readings. That of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, according to Chrysostom, as well as modern critics, means this: "For the word Hagar is [represents] in Arabia Mount Sinai." Chrysostom remarks, "<span class="accented">Hagar</span> is the word for Mount Sinai in the language of that country; "and again, "That mountain where the old covenant was delivered, hath a name in common with the bondwoman." Critics make reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, "I went away into Arabia." "It is difficult," <span class="accented">says</span> Dean Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 50." to resist the thought that he [St. Paul] too may have stood upon the rocks of Sinai, and heard from Arab lips the often-repeated <span class="accented">Ha jar</span>, rock, suggesting the double meaning to which the text alludes." But the Arabic word for "rock" <span class="accented">is chajar</span>, differing from <span class="accented">Hajar</span>, the Arabic form of the bondwoman's name, by having <span class="accented">eheth</span> for its initial letter instead of <span class="accented">he.</span> Further, the Arabs would have used the word only as a common noun, "<span class="accented">rock</span>," and not as a proper noun, the <span class="accented">name</span> of the mountain. St. Paul could not have <span class="accented">mistaken</span> the one for the other. There is no evidence at all to substantiate Chrysostom's assertion that the Arabs did name the mountain Hagar; he apparently thought so only because the apostle seemed to him to affirm it. See Lightfoot further on this point. Moreover, the sentence, "The word Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia," is not what St. Paul would have written to express this idea; either, instead of "in Arabia" he would have written "in the language of the country;" or else, "for the Mount Sinai is called Hagar in Arabia." Another objection to this reading is the order in which the words <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> stand. Elsewhere where the words are conjoined the order is, as in ver. 24, <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span>. The passages are these: <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18, 20</a>; 24:26; 31:18; 34:2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-13.htm">Nehemiah 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a>. The reversal of the order here indicates that <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> is the subject, and <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> belongs to the predicate; that is, that <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span> must be expunged from the text, and that we adopt the other reading, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, "For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia," the well-known land of Hagar and her descendants; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-21.htm">Genesis 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a> (see Mr. Peele's articles on "Hagar" and "Shur" in the 'Dictionary of the Bible'). The article is prefixed to <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> as having been already just mentioned; as if it were "for this Sina is," etc. The purpose of the clause, however it be read, is plainly to make more colourable the allegorical exposition; it explains why the locality of the giving of the Law has been referred to in the words, "one, from Mount Sinai" - a local specification quite alien to the apostle's usual manner in referring to the old covenant, and only had recourse to here for this particular object. And answereth to (or, <span class="accented">is</span> <span class="accented">in the same rank with</span>) Jerusalem which now is (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;</span>); <span class="accented">and standeth in the same class</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in the same column</span>) <span class="accented">with the Jerusalem that now is.</span> The use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> the reader will find amply illustrated in Liddell and Scott's 'Lexicon.' In the military language of Greece, illustrated out of Polybius, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were those standing in the same <span class="accented">file</span> or column, one behind another (as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were those standing side by side in the same <span class="accented">rank</span>). Hence, as if tabulated on a board, ideas belonging to the same class, both types and antitypes, were conceived of as if placed in a vertical line in column, and so were called <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: whilst ideas belonging to a class contrasted with the former, both types and antitypes, were conceived of as placed horizontally opposite to the former in another column; the two sets of contrasted ideas being <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;</span> to each other. Thus in the present instance we have two columns - <p>Hagar, slave mother; &#8212; Sarah, freewoman. <p>Ishmael, slave child; &#8212; Believers, free children. <p>Covenant from Sinai; &#8212; Promise. <p>Jerusalem that now is; etc. &#8212; Jerusalem that is above; etc. (Compare Erasmus's note in Peele's 'Synopsis.') It is not improbable, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, that St. Paul is alluding to some mode of representation common with Jewish teachers employed to exhibit similar allegories (see Bengel's note above referred to). We may, therefore, conclude that the subject of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, whatever it is, is regarded by the apostle as standing in the same category with the now subsisting Jerusalem, especially in the particular respect which he presently insists upon; namely, as being characterized by slavery. For this is the main point of this whole  allegorical illustration; that Judaism is slavery and the Christian state liberty. It is not clear whether the subject of this verb, "standeth in the same column with," is "the covenant from Mount Sinai," or "Hagar," or "Sinai." If either of the two former, then the first clause of this verse is a parenthesis. The construction runs the most smoothly by adopting the third view, which takes" Sinai" as the subject. Sinai, that gave forth the covenant which is represented by Hagar, "stands in the same column" with "the Jerusalem that now is;" for Sinai is the starting-place of the covenant which has now its central abode in Jerusalem; the people that was <span class="accented">there</span> is now <span class="accented">here</span>; and the condition of slavery into which Sinai's covenant brought them marks them now at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">And is in bondage with her children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">for she is in bondage with her children.</span> The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> is substituted for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> by the editors with general consent. That the subject of the verb "is in bondage" is "the Jerusalem that now is," is apparent from the contrasted sentence which next follows, "but the Jerusalem that is above is free." "With her children;" repeatedly did our Lord group Jerusalem with" her children "(<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-35.htm">Luke 13:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-44.htm">Luke 19:44</a>), having, however, in view the city itself with its inhabitants; while St. Paul probably regards Jerusalem more in idea, as representing Judaism in its central manifestation; "her children" being consequently these who were living under the Law. The apostle here <span class="accented">assumes</span> that this mystical Jerusalem with her children was in bondage, making the fact a ground for identifying her with Hagar. That the fact was so St. Paul knew, both from his own experience and from his observation of others. The religious life of Judaism consisted of a servile obedience to a letter Law of ceremonialism, interpreted by the rabbins with an infinity of hair-splitting rules, the exact observance of which was bound upon the conscience of its votaries as of the essence of true piety. The apostle also probably took account of the slavish spirit which very largely characterized the religious teaching of the ruling doctors of Judaism; their bondage, that is, not only to the letter of the Law, but to the traditions also of men; that spirit which those who heard the teaching of the Lord Jesus felt to be so strongly contrasted by <span class="accented">his</span> manner of conceiving and presenting religious truth. "He taught as one having authority, and not as the scribes." But the main point now contemplated by the apostle was bondage to ceremonialism. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x391;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1; &#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x391;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;)<p>The sentence is not parenthetical.

The evidence, however, for the actual identity of the names is deficient. The proper name Hagar signifies wanderer or fugitive (Arab. hadschar, comp. Hegira, the term for the flight of Mahomet). It has probably been confounded with the Arabic chadschar a stone or rock, which cannot be shown to be an Arabic designation of Sinai. The similarity of the first two gutturals might easily lead to the mistake.<p>Answereth to (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)<p>N.T.o.
