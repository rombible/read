For instance, in the present case, is it “the gospel taught by Christ,” or the “gospel <span class= "ital">concerning</span> Christ?” The following rule has been proposed:—In such phrases as the “gospel of salvation,” the “gospel of the kingdom,” the genitive is that of the object—“of” is equivalent to “concerning.” In the phrase “the gospel of God” it represents rather the cause or authorship: “the gospel of which God <span class= "ital">is the Author.”</span> In the present phrase, “the gospel of Christ,” it may be either one or the other, according to the context. We must not, however, narrow too much the Apostle’s use of language. A somewhat vague and ambiguous term sometimes best expresses the fulness of his meaning. In English we might use the phrase “Christ’s gospel” to include at once “the gospel which <span class= "ital">proceeds from</span> Christ,” and “the gospel which <span class= "ital">relates to</span> Christ,” all, in fact, which makes it in any sense <span class= "ital">belong to</span> Him and bear His name.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-9 Those who would establish any other way to heaven than what the gospel of Christ reveals, will find themselves wretchedly mistaken. The apostle presses upon the Galatians a due sense of their guilt in forsaking the gospel way of justification; yet he reproves with tenderness, and represents them as drawn into it by the arts of some that troubled them. In reproving others, we should be faithful, and yet endeavour to restore them in the spirit of meekness. Some would set up the works of the law in the place of Christ's righteousness, and thus they corrupted Christianity. The apostle solemnly denounces, as accursed, every one who attempts to lay so false a foundation. All other gospels than that of the grace of Christ, whether more flattering to self-righteous pride, or more favourable to worldly lusts, are devices of Satan. And while we declare that to reject the moral law as a rule of life, tends to dishonour Christ, and destroy true religion, we must also declare, that all dependence for justification on good works, whether real or supposed, is as fatal to those who persist in it. While we are zealous for good works, let us be careful not to put them in the place of Christ's righteousness, and not to advance any thing which may betray others into so dreadful a delusion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which is not another - There is also a great variety of views in regard to the meaning of this expression. Tyndale translates it: "which is nothing else but there be some that trouble you." Locke, "which is not owing to anything else but only this, that ye are troubled with a certain sort of people who would overturn the gospel of Christ." But Rosenmuller, Koppe, Bloomfield, and others, give a different view; and according to them the sense is, "which, however, is not another gospel, nor indeed the gospel at all, or true," etc. According to this, the design was to state, that what they taught had none of the elements or characteristics of the gospel. It was a different system, and one which taught an entirely different method of justification before God. It seems to me that this is the true sense of the passage, and that Paul means to teach them that the system, though it was called the gospel, was essentially different from that which he had taught, and which consisted in simple reliance on Christ for salvation. The system which they taught, was in fact the Mosaic system; the Jewish mode, depending on the rites and ceremonies of religion; and which, therefore, did not deserve to be called the gospel. It would lead them again with burdensome rites, and with cumbrous institutions, from which it was the great purpose of the gospel to relieve them.<p>But there be some that trouble you - Though this is most manifestly another system, and not the gospel at all, yet there are some persons who are capable of giving trouble and of unsettling your minds, by making it plausible. They pretend that they have come direct front the apostles at Jerusalem; that they have received their instructions from them, and that they preach the true gospel as they teach it. They pretend that Paul was called into the office of an apostle after them; that he had never seen the Lord Jesus; that he had derived his information only from others; and thus they are able to present a plausible argument, and to unsettle the minds of the Galatians.<p>And would pervert - That is, the tendency of their doctrine is wholly to turn away (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  metastrepsai), to destroy, or render useless the gospel of Christ. It would lead to the denial of the necessity of dependence on the merits of the Lord Jesus for salvation, and would substitute dependence on rites and ceremonies. This does not of necessity mean that such was the design of their teaching, for they might have been in the main honest; but that such was the tendency and result of their teaching. It would lead people to rely on the Mosaic rites for salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. another&#8212;A distinct Greek word from that in Ga 1:6.

It is no Gospel, no joyful sound, no good news, and glad tidings; the doctrine which attributes justification to the works of the law, or mixes grace and works in the business of salvation, which was the doctrine of these false teachers, is no Gospel; not truly so, however it may be called; nor does it bring any solid peace and joy to distressed minds. There is but one pure Gospel of the grace of God, and Christ, and his apostles; there is not one and another; there is but one faith, one doctrine and scheme of faith; the Gospel is single and uniform, all of a piece, has no yea and nay, or contradiction in it; this trumpet gives no uncertain sound, nor any dreadful, but a joyful one: <p>but there be some that trouble you; meaning the false apostles, whose names he does not think fit to mention, as being unworthy to be named, and to have their names transmitted to posterity. These troubled the churches with their doctrines and principles, by raising disputes and controversies among them, injecting doubts and scruples into their minds, which puzzled and confounded them, and made them uneasy, and which broke in upon that peace of soul which the Gospel brings and establishes; for no true solid peace is attained to, and enjoyed, but by the doctrine of justification by the righteousness of Christ, pardon by his blood, and atonement by his sacrifice, which the doctrine of justification by works, &amp;c. tends to destroy. <p>And would pervert the Gospel of Christ; which has Christ for its author, subject, and preacher; and particularly the doctrine of justification by his righteousness, which they sought to change, to throw into a different shape and form, to adulterate by mixing it with the works of the law, and so, if possible, destroy it: to this they showed a good will, but were not able to effect, for the Gospel is an everlasting one; it is immovable, and so is that particular doctrine of it; it remains, and will remain in spite of opposition to it. Thus the apostle prudently lays the blame of the Galatians removing from the Gospel to another upon the false teachers, hoping he should be able to reclaim them by solid arguments, and gentle methods. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> pervert the gospel of Christ.</span><p>(4) He warns them in time to remember that there are not many Gospels; and therefore whatever these false apostles pretend who had the Law, Moses, and the fathers in their mouths, yet these ones had indeed corrupted the true Gospel.

Against this interpretation may be urged, first, the fact that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἝΤΕΡΟΝ</span></span></span> previously had the chief emphasis laid on it, and is therefore quite unwarrantably excluded from the reference of the relative which follows; secondly, that Paul must have logically used some such expression as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ὌΝΤΟς ἈΛΛΟῦ</span></span></span>; and lastly, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ΜΉ</span></span></span> never means anything else than <span class="ital">nisi</span>, not even in passages such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm" title="Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-4.htm" title="How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the show bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the priests?">Matthew 12:4</a> (see on this passage); <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-26.htm" title="But to none of them was Elias sent, save to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a woman that was a widow.">Luke 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-17.htm" title="But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk.

The translation of this clause in A.V. and R.V. (<span class="ital">which is not another</span>) has caused great embarrassment by its apparent identification of the spurious Gospel with the true. Lightfoot pleads ingeniously that <span class="greekheb">ἄλλο</span> may mean another besides the true Gospel, and so interprets the clause to mean that it is no Gospel at all; but this will hardly be accepted by most other scholars. The American revisers suggest the rendering <span class="ital">which is nothing else than</span>. But these difficulties arise from making <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> the subject of the sentence: surely it is in fact a connecting adverb (<span class="ital">touching which, as to which, whereas</span>), as it is again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a>, and probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>. If the clause be rendered, <span class="ital">whereas there is no other Gospel</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, than the true), the sense becomes perfectly clear, and it forms an appropriate introduction to the succeeding anathemas by its emphatic testimony to the one true Gospel.—<span class="greekheb">εἰ μή</span> … This clause qualifies the former “there is no other Gospel,” only a spurious semblance (on the use of <span class="greekheb">εἰ μή</span> see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm" title="But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.">Galatians 1:19</a>).—<span class="greekheb">τινές</span>.

Already, in these very words, the apostle means to assert that essential unalterableness of the gospel, which, with solemn emphasis, he in the two following verses more fully affirms. Thus much seems plain. But, owing probably to the impassioned eagerness of the moment, he here, as not unfrequently elsewhere from the like cause, expresses himself in language, the grammatical analysis of which is obscure and in some degree uncertain. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the relative "which" may be taken as reciting the term "gospel" only, that is, the gospel which is properly so called; in which case we may read the sentence thus: "But the gospel is not ['never can be] other" - other, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> than it is as already preached to you; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the relative may recite the "other [or, 'new'] sort of gospel" of ver. 6; and then we should have "But this other-fashioned gospel is not another gospel really," or, "is not the real gospel reappearing in another form." The former method presents undoubtedly, of the two, the harsher way of construing; but constructions as harsh do occasionally present themselves in the apostle's style when writing under strong emotion. The exact analysis, however, is merely a matter of grammatical nicety; the substance of the thought is quite clear. <span class="cmt_word">But there be</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> <span class="accented">...</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">only there are.</span> This construction, of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> followed by a finite verb, is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-5.htm">Mark 6:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "Save that...  he healed them." The force of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, "except," in this passage as well as in some others, may be described as <span class="accented">partially exceptive</span>; that is, it denotes an exception taken, not to the entire foregoing sentence, but to part of it only. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-27.htm">Luke 4:27</a>, "There were many lepers in Israel... and none of them was cleansed, save Naaman the syrian:" where the pronoun "them" recites the "lepers in Israel," but the "save" refers to "lepers" only; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>, "That they should not hurt the grass, neither any green thing, neither any tree, save the men who," etc.: where the "save" points back only to the words, "that they should not hurt;" so again <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>, "Save they which are written in the Lamb's book of life," points back only to the words, "there shall in no wise enter into it." In all such cases the rendering "only" or "but only" would exhibit just the amount of exception which appears intended. In the present instance the most probable explanation is this: the gospel can never be ether than it is; except that among (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> only among) those who proclaim it (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> profess to proclaim it) there are some who so misrepresent its import as to completely reverse its character. <span class="cmt_word">There be some that trouble you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">there are certain who are disquieting you.</span> The form of expression is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, "Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you." The sentence as it stands differs from the supposable substitute, "certain persons are disquieting you," by directing attention me, re to the <span class="accented">persons</span> referred to than merely to their <span class="accented">action</span> viewed in itself; it marks them out as  meriting strong censure, or (in Colossians, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) as persons to be carefully guarded against. Who these troublers were and where they came from is uncertain (see note on ver. 2). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> frequently means "to alarm" or "disquiet," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-3.htm">Matthew 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-26.htm">Matthew 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-12.htm">Luke 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-38.htm">Luke 24:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-14.htm">1 Peter 3:14</a>. And this is probably the sense in which it is used here and in the similar passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-10.htm">Galatians 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-24.htm">Acts 15:24</a>. It describes the action of those who came to believers reposing in a sense of acceptance with God through Christ; and filled their minds with uneasiness and apprehension, by telling them that they were not safe as they were, but must do something else if they wished to really possess the Divine favour. Others, however, connect the verb with the notion of civil disturbance, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-8.htm">Acts 17:8</a>, and thus with raising seditions and shaking men's allegiance, in conformity with the metaphor of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 6. <span class="cmt_word">And would pervert the gospel of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">and would fain turn into its clean contrary the gospel of Christ.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is an appropriate one to use with reference to such a misrepresentation of the gospel as the one now in the apostle's view; for this converted it from a doctrine of emancipation into a doctrine of renewed bondage (comp. ch. 5:1-4). So the verb is used in the only other passages in which it is found in the New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>, "The sun shall be turned into darkness;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-9.htm">James 4:9</a>, "Let your laughter be turned into mourning." So in Sirach 11:31, "Turning good things into evil." Liddell and Scott ('Lexicon') cite <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>   =   "<span class="accented">contrariwise</span>," Plato, 'Gorg.,' 456 E; 'Rep' 587, D.

It was no less than THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST that these men were tampering with. "The gospel of Christ" means here the gospel of which Christ is the Author, as in "the gospel of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>). and which he had sent forth his apostles to proclaim. The peculiar emphasis and the connection forbid our taking the genitive as denoting merely the subject-matter. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Another (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;)<p>A different gospel is not another gospel.
