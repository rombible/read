The doctrine to which they had at first given in their adhesion was a doctrine of salvation by grace: they now imagined that they were only hearing a different version of the same truths. A different version? How was that possible? There could not be any second gospel, nor was there really anything of the kind. It was not a new gospel, but only a factious perversion of the <span class= "ital">old.</span> Those who do this—no matter who they be—are accursed. That, at least, is plain speaking, and no one can accuse it of time-serving.<p>The Apostle had ended his address to the Galatians abruptly, and now he plunges abruptly, and without more preface, into the midst of his charges against them. He cannot understand their sudden apostasy.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Removed.</span>—The Greek word is one regularly used for a “deserter,” “turn-coat,” or “apostate,” either in war, politics, or religion. The tense is strictly present: “You are now, at this moment, in the act of falling away.”<p><span class= "bld">Him that called you.</span>—The call of the Christian is attributed by St. Paul to God the Father; so even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-6.htm" title="Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:">Romans 1:6</a>. The Christian, having been <span class= "ital">called</span> by God, <span class= "ital">belongs to</span> Christ. The part taken by Christ in the calling of the Christian is rather a mediate agency, such as is expressed in the next phrase.<p><span class= "bld">Into the grace of Christ.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">by the grace of Christ.</span> The grace (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the free love) of Christ becomes the instrument of the divine calling, inasmuch as it is through the preaching of that free love and free gift that the unbeliever is at first attracted and won over to the faith. The “grace of Christ” is His voluntary self-surrender to humiliation and death, from no other prompting than His own love for sinful men.<p>(6, 7) <span class= "bld">Unto another gospel: which is not another.</span>—It is to be regretted that the English language hardly admits the fine shade of distinction which exists here in the Greek. The Greek has two words for “another:” one (the first of those which is here used) implying a difference in kind, the other implying mere numerical addition.<p>Another gospel do I call it? That would seem to concede its right to be called a gospel at all. It might be supposed to be some alternative theory, existing side by side with that which you originally heard; but this cannot be. This “other gospel” is not a second gospel; for there cannot be two gospels. The inference, therefore, to be drawn is that it is not a gospel in any sense of the word. This, then, may be dismissed. It is no true gospel, but only mischievous and factious meddling on the part of certain false teachers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:...">Galatians 1:6-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">I marvel that ye are so soon </span>— After my leaving you; <span class="ital">removed from him that called you into the grace </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">by, </span>or through the grace; <span class="ital">of Christ </span>— His gracious gospel, and his gracious power. God is generally said to <span class="ital">call </span>men into the grace of Christ, but the phraseology seems here to point out <span class="ital">Paul, </span>and not <span class="ital">God, </span>as the person spoken of. For as he wrote this chapter to prove himself an apostle, his success in calling the Galatians to the Christian faith was fitly mentioned as one of the proofs of his apostleship, as it implied that he was assisted in that work by God. <span class="ital">Unto another gospel </span>— Or pretended revelation from God, concerning the way of attaining justification and salvation, a way entirely inconsistent with the very fundamental principles of that doctrine which you were first taught. As these Galatians were descendants of the Gauls, as has been observed in the preface, it is the less to be wondered at that they were so unstable; the inhabitants of France, as M. Saurin observes, having been always reproached with taking impressions easily, and as easily suffering them to be effaced. <span class="ital">Which is not </span>indeed properly <span class="ital">another gospel </span>— For what ye have now received is no gospel at all. It is not glad, but heavy tidings, as setting your acceptance with God upon terms impossible to be performed. <span class="ital">But there </span>are <span class="ital">some </span>— Who, on pretence that their doctrine of justification by the law of Moses is authorized by God; <span class="ital">trouble you </span>— With doubts concerning my doctrine, and disturb the peace of the church; <span class="ital">and would </span>— If they were able; <span class="ital">pervert </span>and overthrow <span class="ital">the gospel of Christ</span> — This the Judaizing teachers effectually did by teaching that justification could not be obtained purely by faith in Christ, but that circumcision and the observation of the Jewish ceremonies were necessary thereto; and the better to effect their purpose, they suggested that the other apostles, yea, and Paul himself, insisted on the observance of the law. <span class="ital">But though we </span>— I and all the apostles; <span class="ital">or an angel from heaven </span>— If it were possible; should <span class="ital">preach any other gospel unto you </span>— Any other method of obtaining justification and salvation; <span class="ital">than that which we have </span>formerly <span class="ital">preached unto you </span>— And confirmed by such evident and uncontrolled miracles; <span class="ital">let him, be accursed </span>— Greek, <span class="ital">anathema: </span>let him be cut off from God, and Christ, and his people, and devoted to a perpetual and most dreadful curse. The apostle speaks thus, because he was absolutely certain of his own inspiration, and that the gospel which he had preached was the only true and genuine gospel of Christ.

The apostle presses upon the Galatians a due sense of their guilt in forsaking the gospel way of justification; yet he reproves with tenderness, and represents them as drawn into it by the arts of some that troubled them. In reproving others, we should be faithful, and yet endeavour to restore them in the spirit of meekness. Some would set up the works of the law in the place of Christ's righteousness, and thus they corrupted Christianity. The apostle solemnly denounces, as accursed, every one who attempts to lay so false a foundation. All other gospels than that of the grace of Christ, whether more flattering to self-righteous pride, or more favourable to worldly lusts, are devices of Satan. And while we declare that to reject the moral law as a rule of life, tends to dishonour Christ, and destroy true religion, we must also declare, that all dependence for justification on good works, whether real or supposed, is as fatal to those who persist in it. While we are zealous for good works, let us be careful not to put them in the place of Christ's righteousness, and not to advance any thing which may betray others into so dreadful a delusion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I marvel - I wonder. It is remarked by Luther (his commentary at the place) that Paul uses as mild a word as possible here. He does not employ the language of severe reproof, but he expresses his astonishment that the thing should have occurred. He was deeply affected and amazed, that such a thing could have happened. They had cordially embraced the gospel; they had manifested the tenderest attachment for him; they had given themselves to God, and yet in a very short time they had been led wholly astray, and had embraced opinions which tended wholly to pervert and destroy the gospel. They had shown an instability and inconstancy of character, which was to him perfectly surprising.<p>That ye are so soon - This proves that the Epistle was written not long after the gospel was first preached to them. According to the general supposition, it could not have been more than from two to five years. Had it been a long and gradual decline; had they been destitute for years of the privileges of the gospel; or had they had time to forget him who had first preached to them, it would not have been a matter of surprise. But when it occurred in a few months; when their once ardent love for Paul, and their confidence in him had so soon vanished, or their affections become alienated, and when they had so soon embraced opinions tending to, set the whole gospel aside, it could not but excite Paul's wonder. Learn hence, that men, professedly pious, and apparently ardently attached to the gospel, may become soon perverted in their views, and alienated from those who had called them into the gospel, and whom they professed tenderly to love. The ardor of the affections becomes cool, and some artful, and zealous, and plausible teachers of error seduce the mind, corrupt the heart, and alienate the affections. Where there is the ardor of the first love to God, there is also an effort soon made by the adversary, to turn away the heart from him; and young converts are commonly soon attacked in some plausible manner, and by art and arguments adapted to turn away their minds from the truth, and to alienate the affections from God.<p>So soon removed - Luther remarks that this is also a mild and gentle term. It implies that foreign influence had been used to turn away their minds from the truth. The word used here (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;  metatithesthe) means, "to transpose; to put in another place;" and then, "to go over from one party to another." Their affections had become transferred to other doctrines than those which they had at first embraced, and they had moved off from the only true foundation, to one which would give them no support.<p>From him that called you - There has been great difference of opinion in regard to the sense of this passage. Some have supposed, that it refers to God; others to Christ; others to Paul himself. Either supposition makes good sense, and conveys an idea not contrary to the Scriptures in other places. Doddridge, Chandler, Clarke, Macknight, Locke, and some others refer it to Paul; Rosenmuller, Koppe, and others, suppose it refers to God; and others refer it to the Redeemer. The Syriac renders it thus: "I marvel that ye are so soon turned away from that Messiah (Christ) who has called you." etc. It is not possible, perhaps, to determine the true sense. It does not seem to me to refer to Paul, as the main object of the Epistle is, not to show that they had removed from "him," but from the "gospel" - a far more grievous offence; and it seems to me that it is to he referred to God. The reasons are:<p>(1) That he who had called them, is said to have called them "into the grace of Christ," which would be hardly said of Christ himself; and,<p>(2) That the work of calling people is usually in the Scriptures attributed to God; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>.<p>Into the grace of Christ - Locke renders this, "into the covenant of grace which is by Christ." Doddridge understands it of the method of salvation which is by or through the grace of Christ. There is no doubt that it refers to the plan of salvation which is by Christ, or in Christ; and the main idea is, that the scheme of salvation which they had embraced under his instruction, was one which contemplated salvation only by the grace or favor of Christ; and that from that they had been removed to another scheme, essentially different, where the grace of Christ was made useless and void. It is Paul's object to show that the true plan makes Christ the great and prominent object; and that the plan which they had embraced was in this respect wholly different.<p>Unto another gospel - A gospel which destroys the grace of Christ; which proclaims salvation on other terms than simple dependence on the merits of the Lord Jesus; and which has introduced the Jewish rites and ceremonies as essential, in order to obtain salvation. The apostle calls that scheme the "gospel," because it pretended to be; it was preached by those who claimed to be preachers of the gospel; who alleged that they had come direct from the apostles at Jerusalem, and who pretended to declare the method of salvation. It claimed to be the gospel, and yet it was essentially unlike the plan which he had preached as constituting the gospel. That which he preached, inculcated the entire dependence of the sinner on the merits and grace of Christ; that system had introduced dependence on the observance of the rites of the Mosaic system, as necessary to salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Without the usual expressions of thanksgiving for their faith, &c., he vehemently plunges into his subject, zealous for "the glory" of God (Ga 1:5), which was being disparaged by the Galatians falling away from the pure Gospel of the "grace" of God.<p>I marvel&#8212;implying that he had hoped better things from them, whence his sorrowful surprise at their turning out so different from his expectations.<p>so soon&#8212;after my last visit; when I hoped and thought you were untainted by the Judaizing teachers. If this Epistle was written from Corinth, the interval would be a little more than three years, which would be "soon" to have fallen away, if they were apparently sound at the time of his visit. Ga 4:18, 20 may imply that he saw no symptom of unsoundness then, such as he hears of in them now. But English Version is probably not correct there. See see on [2331]Ga 4:18; [2332]Ga 4:20; also see [2333]Introduction. If from Ephesus, the interval would be not more than one year. Birks holds the Epistle to have been written from Corinth after his FIRST visit to Galatia; for this agrees best with the "so soon" here: with Ga 4:18, "It is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you." If they had persevered in the faith during three years of his first absence, and only turned aside after his second visit, they could not be charged justly with adhering to the truth only when he was present: for his first absence was longer than both his visits, and they would have obeyed longer in his "absence" than in his "presence." But if their decline had begun immediately after he left them, and before his return to them, the reproof will be just. But see on [2334]Ga 4:13.<p>removed&#8212;Translate, "are being removed," that is, ye are suffering yourselves so soon (whether from the time of my last visit, or from the time of the first temptation held out to you) [Par&aelig;us] to be removed by Jewish seducers. Thus he softens the censure by implying that the Galatians were tempted by seducers from without, with whom the chief guilt lay: and the present, "ye are being removed," implies that their seduction was only in process of being effected, not that it was actually effected. Wahl, Alford, and others take the Greek as middle voice. "ye are removing" or "passing over." "Shifting your ground" [Conybeare and Howson]. But thus the point of Paul's oblique reference to their misleaders is lost; and in Heb 7:12 the Greek is used passively, justifying its being taken so here. On the impulsiveness and fickleness of the Gauls (another form of Kel-t-s, the progenitors of the Erse, Gauls, Cymri, and Belgians), whence the Galatians sprang, see [2335]Introduction and C&aelig;sar [Commentaries on the Gallic War, 3.19].<p>from him that called you&#8212;God the Father (Ga 1:15; Ga 5:8; Ro 8:30; 1Co 1:9; 1Th 2:12; 5:24).<p>into&#8212;rather, as Greek, "IN the grace of Christ," as the element in which, and the instrument by which, God calls us to salvation. Compare Note, see on [2336]1Co 7:15; Ro 5:15, "the gift by (Greek, 'in') grace (Greek, 'the grace') of (the) one man." "The grace of Christ," is Christ's gratuitously purchased and bestowed justification, reconciliation, and eternal life.<p>another&#8212;rather, as Greek, "a second and different gospel," that is, into a so-called gospel, different altogether from the only true Gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/galatians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle here beginneth the matter and substance of his Epistle, with a reprehension of this church; which in, some things is much qualified, in other things much aggravated. His expressing his reproof by the word <span class="bld">marvel, </span> hath in it something of mitigation, and signifieth his better hopes concerning them. The term <span class="bld">removed, </span> also, mollifies the reproof, the apostle thereby rather charging their apostacy upon their seducers, than upon them who were seduced; though they were not to be excused for their so yielding to the temptation, and that in so short a time, either after their first conversion, or after the first attempts upon them to seduce them; and herein was the aggravation of their guilt, that they very little resisted the temptation, but were presently overthrown by it. But it was a greater aggravation of their guilt, that they suffered themselves to be removed <span class="bld">from him that called</span> them. Interpreters doubt whether this be to be understood of God, or of Paul; and if of God, whether of the First or of the Second Person. That which inclineth some to think that Paul meant himself, was his instrumentality in the conversion of these Galatians; and his complaints of them in this Epistle, for their deserting his doctrine, and alienation from him; but then the substantive to the participle must be understood, and the call must be understood of the external call only, by the ministry of the word. It therefore seemeth rather to be understood of God; the apostles generally ascribing calling to God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-8.htm" title="This persuasion comes not of him that calls you.">Galatians 5:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm" title="Faithful is he that calls you, who also will do it.">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-2.htm" title="Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied.">1 Peter 1:2</a>,15 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2 Peter 1:3</a></span>.

The apostle now enters on the subject matter of this epistle, and opens the occasion and design of it, which were to reprove the Galatians for their instability in the Gospel; and, if possible, to reclaim them, who were removed, or removing from the simplicity of it; and which was very surprising to the apostle, who had entertained a good opinion of them, looked upon them as persons called by the grace of God, well established in the doctrines of the Gospel, and in no danger of being carried away with the error of the wicked the person from whom he says they were removed is, <p>from him that called you into the grace of Christ; by whom is meant, not the apostle himself, who had been an instrument in the calling of them to the knowledge of Christ, and the participation of his grace, and from whose Gospel, or the Gospel as preached by him, in its clearness and purity, they were now departing; but either Christ, and so the Syriac and Arabic versions read the words, "from Christ who called you by own grace"; or rather God the Father, and some copies read, "into", or "by the grace of God": to whom calling is most commonly ascribed in the sacred writings: and which is to be understood, not of a ministerial call, or a call to preach the Gospel of Christ; though there might be some in these churches who were called both internally and externally to that sacred office; nor a mere outward call by the ministry: for though doubtless there might be some among them who were only so called, yet as much as they were under profession of Christ, and nothing appearing to the contrary, they were all in a judgment of charity looked upon as effectually called by the grace of God; which calling is here meant: for they were called "into the grace of Christ"; some read it, "in", or "by the grace of Christ": referring it either to the moving cause of calling, which is not the works and merits of men, but the free grace and favour of God in Christ; or to the efficient cause of it, which is not the power and will of man, but the efficacious grace of Christ, through the powerful operations of his Spirit: but the words are well rendered, "into the grace of Christ"; that is, to the enjoyment of the fulness of grace which is in Christ; of all the blessings of grace he has in his hands; such as justification, peace, pardon, atonement, wisdom, strength, joy, comfort, and every supply of grace; and particularly fellowship with him, into which the saints are called, and than which nothing is more desirable: but the difficulty is, how such persons can be said to be removed from God, who has thus called them to partake of grace in Christ. They are not, nor can they be removed from the everlasting and unchangeable love of God to them in Christ, of which their calling is a fruit, effect, and evidence; nor from their covenant interest in him, which is immovable and inviolable; nor from a state of justification, in which they openly are, who in the effectual calling have passed from death to life, and so shall never enter into condemnation; nor from the family and household of God, in which they are; no, nor from the grace of calling with which they are called by God, and which has eternal salvation inseparably connected with it; but this must be understood doctrinally of their removal from the Gospel of Christ, though not of a total and final one. It is observed by some, that the word used is in the present tense, and shows that they were not gone off from the Gospel, but were upon going, so that the apostle had some hopes, yea, confidence of their being restored, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-10.htm">Galatians 5:10</a>. And besides, though such as are truly called by grace cannot be finally and totally deceived by false prophets and false teachers, yet they may be greatly unhinged by them, and may fall from some degree of steadfastness in the doctrine of faith, which was the case of these Galatians: but what increased the apostle's surprise, and aggravated their sin and weakness, was, that they were "so soon" removed from the simplicity of the Gospel; he having been with them but a few years before, and preached the Gospel to them, which the means of their conversion, and of planting churches among them; at least he had lately paid them a visit, when he afresh strengthened them in the faith of the Gospel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>. Or this may regard that easiness of mind which appeared in them, who upon the first attack of them by the false teachers, were weakly and cowardly giving up their faith, and at once giving into the notions of these men, as soon as they were proposed unto them. That which they are said to be removed <p>unto is <p>another Gospel, different from that, and very unlike to what had been preached to them, and they had received; which had nothing of the grace of Christ, of the doctrines and blessings of grace that had, by which they were called; very different from the Gospel of Christ, and his apostles, insomuch that it did not deserve the name of a Gospel; and the apostle calls it so, not that he thought it to be one, but because it was in the opinion of others, and was so styled by the false apostles; wherefore, by way of concession, he so calls it, though he immediately corrects it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> I marvel that ye are so soon <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</span><p>(3) The first part of the epistle, in which he witnesses that he is an apostle, nothing inferior to those chief disciples of Christ, and wholly agreeing with them, whose names the false apostles abused.

There could be but one true Gospel; this new doctrine was no Gospel at all, but only a heretical perversion of the truth by foreign agitators.

Even for the Corinthians, notwithstanding the party spirit which prevailed among them and the grievous sin which called for sharp rebuke, he has words of affection and even thankfulness.

It cannot fail to strike every careful reader. <span class="cmt_word">I marvel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">I do marvel.</span> The verb is used here with reference to something disappointing, something felt to be painful as well as strange. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a> with reference to the unbelief of the Nazarenes. It is unjust to the apostle to take this "I do marvel" of his as a mere artifice of politic address: though unquestionably, as Chrysostom and Luther have well noted, it does soften his rebuke. The apostle was genuinely surmised; for he had had so much reason for thinking well of them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-14.htm">Galatians 4:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>). How could converts, once so cordial and affectionate, have possibly been so misled? As he reflects on the case, whatever feeling of resentment mingled with his surprise turns off upon the pseudo-evangelists misleading them; and accordingly it is upon these that his anathema is pronounced, not upon <span class="accented">them</span> at all (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9, 12</a>). They, indeed, by listening to the false teaching, were in danger of falling from grace; but this he rather compassionates than angrily denounces. <span class="cmt_word">That ye are so soon removed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">that ye are so quickly falling away.</span> This "quickly" has been taken by many as meaning "so soon after ye were called," and as consequently furnishing some ground for determining the time of the writing of the Epistle. But the comparison of the use of the same adverb (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>, "Be not quickly shaken;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a>, "Lay hands hastily on no man," suggests rather the meaning, "so quickly upon being solicited thereto." The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to transfer one's self to a different course of thinking, acting, partisanship (cf. Liddell and Scott, 'Lexicon'), is used both in an unfavourable and in a good sense. Thus 2 Macc. 7:24, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> "If he would give over following the laws of his country;" Appian, 'Bell. Mithr.,' 41: "Falling away, going over, from (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) Archelaus to Sylla;" Jamblich, 'Protrept,' 17, "Change from (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) a restless and profligate mode of life to an orderly one." The verb, being in the present tense, and not in the aorist or the perfect, suggests the idea of an action in its commencing stage, and not yet fully consummated; as Chrysostom observes: "That is, 'I do not yet believe nor suppose that the delusion has got to be complete' - the language of one who will fain win them back." <span class="cmt_word">From him that called you into the grace of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">from him that called you w be in the grace of Christ.</span> The phrase, "he that called you," recites the personality of "our God and Father," spoken of in vers. 3, 4. The calling of man into the kingdom of God is habitually ascribed by St. Paul to the First Person in the Trinity (cf. ver. 15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>). God's name is omitted, as in ver. 15 (where it is wanting in the more recent texts), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8</a>, "For he that wrought for Peter." The apostle impressively, even startlingly, describes their defection from the truth of the gospel as no other than a defection from God himself; similarly to the strain of language pursued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-15</a>. "The grace of Christ" recites the state of acceptance with God into which Christians are brought by Christ through faith in him. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>. "Fallen  away from grace;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>, "Through whom we have also had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand." The genitive, "of Christ," denotes the Author, as in" the peace of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>); "righteousness of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>, etc.). There is a pathos in the word "grace," as referring to the sweet gentleness of Christ's yoke as contrasted with the yoke of ceremonial-ism which the Galatians were so foolishly hankering after. The construction, "Called you in the grace of Christ," is similar to "Called us in peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>); "Ye were called in one hope of your calling" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>); "Called us... in sanctification" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>). The verb "call," implying as it does the bringing into a certain state, suggests the sense here given to the clause, in preference to our taking it as meaning "called you by the grace of Christ." <span class="cmt_word">Unto another gospel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">unto another</span> (or, <span class="accented">a new</span>) <span class="accented">sort of gospel.</span> The adjective <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;</span> used in the next verse, appears to intimate the changed quality of the object, its strange new-fangled character. The adjective does sometimes take this shade of meaning. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "By men of strange tongues, and by lips of strangers;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-4.htm">2 Corinthians 11:4</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>," Different spirit...  different gospel;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "Teach a different doctrine." The reader will find a brief but instructive description of the difference at times observable between <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in Bishop Lightfoot's note on the passage; who cites the Septuagint rendering in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a> of the Hebrew "new king," which it gives <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3c2;</span>: and a passage in Xenophon's 'Cyclopaedia,' 8:3, 8, "If you accuse me... another time when I serve you...  you will find me (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>) another sort of attendant." The phrase, "another sort of gospel," so far as giving the new form of doctrine the title of "gospel" at all, is paradoxical and sarcastic. The paradox is corrected in what follows. The substantive, "gospel." is borrowed, not without a tinge of irony, from the pretensions of the innovators; they, of course, would be ready to designate their mangled form of Christian doctrine as still "the gospel." The epithet which the apostle adds gives his own view of its character. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I marvel (&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;)<p>Often by Greek orators of surprise as something reprehensible.
