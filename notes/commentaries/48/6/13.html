But the apostle professes his own faith, hope, and joy; and that his principal glory was in the cross of Christ. By which is here meant, his sufferings and death on the cross, the doctrine of salvation by a crucified Redeemer. By Christ, or by the cross of Christ, the world is crucified to the believer, and he to the world. The more we consider the sufferings of the Redeemer from the world, the less likely shall we be to love the world. The apostle was as little affected by its charms, as a beholder would be by any thing which had been graceful in the face of a crucified person, when he beholds it blackened in the agonies of death. He was no more affected by the objects around him, than one who is expiring would be struck with any of the prospects his dying eyes might view from the cross on which he hung. And as to those who have truly believed in Christ Jesus, all things are counted as utterly worthless compared with him. There is a new creation; old things are passed away, and new views and dispositions are brought in under the regenerating influences of God the Holy Spirit. Believers are brought into a new world, and being created in Christ Jesus unto good works, are formed to a life of holiness. It is a change of mind and heart, whereby we are enabled to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to live to God; and where this inward, practical religion is wanting, outward professions, or names, will never stand in any stead.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For neither they themselves who are circumcised - The Jewish teachers, or perhaps all Jews. It was true in general that the Jews did not wholly and entirely obey the Law of Moses, but it is probable that the apostle refers particularly here to the judaizing teachers in Galatia.<p>Keep the law - The Law of Moses, or the Law of God. Paul's idea is, that if they were circumcised they brought themselves under obligation to keep the whole law of God; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>. But they did not do it.<p>(1) no person perfectly observes the whole law of God.<p>(2) the Jewish nation as such were very far from doing it.<p>(3) it is probable that these persons did not pretend even to keep the whole Law of Moses.<p>Paul insists on it that if they were circumcised, and depended on that for salvation, they were under obligation to keep the whole law. But they did not. Probably they did not offer sacrifice, or join in any of the numerous observances of the Jewish nation, except some of the more prominent, such as circumcision. This, says Paul, is inconsistent in the highest degree; and they thus show their insincerity and hypocrisy.<p>That they may glory in your flesh - In having you as converts, and in persuading you to be circumcised, that they may show their zeal for the Law, and thus escape persecution. The phrase "in your flesh" here, is equivalent to "in your circumcision;" making use of your circumcision to promote their own importance, and to save themselves from persecution. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

That is, the pleaders for, and preachers of circumcision, whether they themselves were actually circumcised, or not; it means those that were of the circumcision, on that side of the question, whether heartily or not: <p>keep the law; of circumcision, as persons may preach up that, which they themselves do not practise; as did the Pharisees, the predecessors of these men; or if they did keep the law, and submit to it, yet this might be done, not out of regard unto it, and zeal for it, but for some other end; as Simon Magus submitted to baptism, and others preached Christ of envy and contention, and not of good will; or if they did do it in obedience to the law, yet this was not keeping the whole law, which circumcision obliged to; and which, unless they did so keep it, would signify nothing; and this no man is capable of keeping perfectly, and consequently no righteousness, life, and salvation, can be had hereby: besides, though these men were so zealous for the lighter matters of the law, the rites and ceremonies of it, as circumcision, &amp;c. they disregarded the weightier and more material parts of it, as judgment, mercy, and faith; these they kept not, nor attended to: and many of them lived very dissolute lives and conversations, at least secretly, if not openly; which abundantly proved that they were far from keeping the law; and that their pleading for it, and submitting to some of the rituals of it, were not out of pure love and strict regard to it, but for some other end: <p>but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh; that is, in the circumcision of it; or, as the Ethiopic version, "in your bodies". Their view in bringing persons to submit to circumcision was, that they might have occasion to glory among the Jews, and boast to them of the numbers of proselytes they brought, and of the service they did to Judaism, and so increase their fame and glory among them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> your flesh.</span><p>(l) That they have entangled you in Judaism, and yet he dwells on the aspect of circumcision.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/galatians/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-13.htm" title="For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.">Galatians 6:13</a>.

But the <span class="ital">ground</span> for their non-observance of the Mosaic law is conceived by Paul to be, neither their distance from Jerusalem (Theodoret and others; also Schott), nor the general impossibility of a complete fulfilment of the law (Jerome, Estius; comp.

The emphasis is, however, on <span class="greekheb">ὑμετέρᾳ</span>;[268] hence Olshausen is the more wrong in finding a contrast—which is quite out of place here—to the <span class="ital">souls</span>, which those false teachers ought to have sought after.

It is a <span class="greekheb">καυχάσθαι</span>, in the face not of <span class="ital">heathenism</span> (Holsten), but of the <span class="ital">non-Christian Judaism</span>, from whose side the persecution on account of the cross of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm" title="As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.">Galatians 6:12</a>) was threatened.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[267] 1 As at any rate the false teachers are meant, and these were <span class="ital">Jewish Christians</span>, the reading <span class="greekheb">περιτεμνόμενοι</span> is plainly absurd. They were, in fact, not subjected to circumcision (Reithmayr), but <span class="ital">circumcised</span>, and could not therefore be designated, “according to their quality as Jews” (Moeller on de Wette), as <span class="greekheb">περιτεμνόμενοι</span> (<span class="ital">present</span>). See especially Reiche, p. 93. The idea that these people were formerly <span class="ital">Gentiles</span>, part of whom were still <span class="ital">on the point</span> of accepting circumcision, and that their <span class="ital">adherents</span> are included (de Wette), is quite as unhistorical (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm" title="And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brothers, and said, Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.">Acts 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm" title="But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.">Acts 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-22.htm" title="Are they Hebrews? so am I.

In his <span class="ital">Zeitschr</span>. 1860, p. 220, Hilgenfeld appeals to <span class="greekheb">οἱ περιτεμνόμενοι</span> in the <span class="ital">Act. Petr. et Pauli</span>, 63; but wrongly, because there (see the sequel) the subject is moral circumcision. The view of Neander is also mistaken, p. 366. According to Wieseler and Matthias, who likewise read <span class="greekheb">περιτεμνόμενοι</span>, the <span class="greekheb">περιτεμνόμενοι</span> were those among the <span class="ital">Galatian Gentile Christians</span>, who, led away by the pseudo-apostles, <span class="ital">allowed themselves to be circumcised</span>. In that case we must with these expositors make the seducers themselves, the pseudo-apostles, the subject of <span class="greekheb">θέλουσιν</span>. But this view is intolerable; how could Paul enable the reader to guess this change of subject? The subject of <span class="greekheb">φυλάσσ</span>. must also be the subject of <span class="greekheb">θέλουσιν</span>, or else Paul must have written as awkwardly as possible. Consequently the subject of both the verbs can only be the false apostles, who, however, were <span class="greekheb">περιτετμημένοι</span>, and not <span class="greekheb">περιτεμνόμενοι</span>.—Hofmann and Holsten are of opinion that the present participle is intended to denote the <span class="ital">Jews generally</span>, inasmuch as <span class="ital">circumcision was in use</span> among them. Against this view it may be decisively urged, that the subjects of the following <span class="greekheb">θέλουσιν</span> can be no other than <span class="greekheb">οἱ περιτεμνόμενοι</span>, and thus likewise the Israelites generally (as Hofmann consistently explains it); nevertheless these <span class="greekheb">θέλοντες</span> (ver. 13) must necessarily be the very same as those to whom the <span class="greekheb">θέλουσιν</span> in ver. 12 applies, and therefore not the Jews generally, but the <span class="ital">Judaistic adversaries</span>. Moreover, to these only is the <span class="greekheb">οὐδέ</span>, <span class="ital">not even</span>, suitable, which presupposes in those concerned a <span class="ital">higher degree</span> of obligation than in the case of others who were bound to obey the law. The forced expedient of Holsten is highly arbitrary: that Paul included the false teachers (consequently, according to our reading and interpretation, the <span class="greekheb">περιτετμημένοι</span>) in the <span class="ital">category</span> of those <span class="ital">circumcising themselves</span> (and therefore the <span class="greekheb">περιτεμνόμενοι</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[268] Not on <span class="greekheb">σαρκί</span> (Matthias, Holsten), as if Paul had written <span class="greekheb">τῇ σαρκὶ ὑμῶν</span>.

He justifies the imputation of a bad motive, by a fact which cannot be denied. The Judaizers could not pretend that they so complied with the terms of the Law as perfectly to fulfil its requirements. They could not be justified by the Law. They acknowledged in some sense their need of Christ. And if so, why impose one of the legal ceremonies as necessary to salvation?

"For;" pointing back to the words," only that," "for no other reason than that," of the previous verse. The apostle means, it is from no zeal for the Law itself that they do what they do, for they are at no pains to keep the Law; but only with the object of currying favour with the Jews. The present participle <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is the reading more generally accepted, though the perfect <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> has a competing amount of documentary authentication. The perfect is so much the easier reading to understand ("not even those who have actually been circumcised") as to be much more likely to be a correction displacing <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> than the converse hypothesis of the latter being a correction of the other borrowed from ver. 3. "They who are being circumcised" may be understood of a party, <span class="accented">including those who first set the movement ageing</span>, who were one after another undergoing the rite. Another turn is given to this participial phrase, as meaning "who are eager for circumcision," "who are all for being circumcised, the circumcision  party." Bishop Lightfoot is in favour of this view, referring to "the apt quotation" from an apocryphal book, in which the phrase appears used in this very sense (see his note). It is a sense grammatically difficult to sustain from the usage of the New Testament; for <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-23.htm">Galatians 1:23</a>, which has been cited on its behalf, does not bear it out. But the passion of scorn with which the apostle writes make the supposed strain upon strict grammatical propriety not altogether improbable. "Themselves;" this is inserted with allusion to the zeal shown by those men, both the first promoters and those drawn in by them, in urging upon <span class="accented">others</span> the observance, not indeed of the whole Law, but of certain of its prescriptions. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is used similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-26.htm">Romans 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>. The sense seems founded upon the notion of watching the Law to see what it requires, as one is endeavouring to carry it out. The article is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, though specifically denoting the Law of Moses, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25, 27</a>, and often. <span class="cmt_word">But desire to have</span> <span class="cmt_word">you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">but they desire you to receive circumcision</span>, <span class="accented">that in your flesh they may have whereof to glory.</span> The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> is used in its proper original sense, "instead of that." All that they want is that in their intercourse with the Jews they may have your circumcision to refer to as evidence of the high respect which they and you as influenced by them have for the Law. "See! so far from trampling upon the Law, we and these our brethren too are adopting the very badge of the servants of the Law." The word "flesh" is in this clause used in its strictly literal signification. The account which the apostle here gives of the motives actuating this particular section of Judaizing reactionaries was no doubt grounded on specific information which he had just received. But such information, both in respect to its general probability and to its grave importance, was doubtless corroborated to his own mind by large experience which he had had elsewhere among the Gentile Churches of the behaviour of unsteady and imperfectly instructed Gentile converts. In almost every important place where Gentiles were won to the faith, there were previously existing communities of Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>); and contact with these must have given rise to an endless diversity of relations both of attraction and of repulsion. Everywhere, from the very first, the contact of Christianity with Judaism gave birth to varying phases of Judaico-Christian-ism such as afterwards developed into monstrous forms of error. It was no new thing with the apostle that he should find himself called upon to check, on the part of weak or insincere brethren, a tendency to draw towards Judaism at the cost of not merely unseemly but even fundamentally fatal compliances. The peril was always very near, and had to be constantly watched and guarded against. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Neither they themselves who are circumcised (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; - &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>For neither, translate not even.

The participle tells nothing as to the antecedents of these persons, whether Jewish or heathen. It is general, those who are receiving circumcision. It is  equals  the circumcision-party; and the present participle represents them as in present activity. They are circumcised themselves, and are endeavoring to force circumcision upon others.<p>Keep the law (&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>.
