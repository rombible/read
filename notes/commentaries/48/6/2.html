Our Lord Himself was said to “bear” the physical infirmities of those whom He healed. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a> : “He bare our sicknesses.”)<p><span class= "bld">So fulfil.</span>—The reading here is somewhat doubtful, and the balance of authorities interesting. On the one hand, for the Received text adopted in our version is a large majority of the MSS.; on the other hand, the reading, <span class= "ital">ye shall fulfil,</span> is found in the Vatican and two good Græco-Latin<span class= "note">[62]</span> MSS., but has besides <span class= "ital">an almost unanimous support</span> from the versions. As several of these were composed at a very early date, and as they necessarily represent a wide geographical dispersion; as, further, the MS. authority for the reading—though small in quantity is good in quality—also representing the evidence of widely separated regions; and as, finally, the internal evidence or probabilities of corruption are also in favour of the same reading, it would seem, on the whole, to have the greater claim to acceptance. The meaning is that by showing sympathy to others in their distress, of whatever kind that distress may be—whether physical, mental, or moral—the Christian will best fulfil that “new commandment” bequeathed to him by his Master, the “law of love.” (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-23.htm" title="And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.">1John 3:23</a>.)<p><span class= "note">[62] Practically, these two MSS. can only count as one as both seem to have been copied from the same original.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/6-2.htm" title="Bear you one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ....">Galatians 6:2-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Bear ye one another’s burdens </span>— Sympathize with and assist each other, in all your weaknesses, grievances, trials. The apostle alludes to the custom of travellers, who, when too heavily laden with their baggage, relieve one another by bearing the burdens of the weak or fatigued, and in that manner show their good disposition toward each other; <span class="ital">and so fulfil the law of Christ </span>— Even that law of love, which he particularly and especially enjoins, terming it his new commandment, and making it the distinguishing mark of his disciples; and surely we may willingly receive that law from one who was himself such an unequalled example of love, and who with so gracious a sympathy bore our burdens of sorrow, and carried away the load of our guilt. <span class="ital">For if a man </span>— If any one; <span class="ital">think himself to be something </span>— Above his brethren, and take up an overweening opinion of himself; <span class="ital">when he is nothing — </span>Like what he apprehends himself to be; and in particular if he be so conceited of his own sufficiency, as to imagine that he is able to resist temptation by his own strength, or by the strength of inherent grace, and thereupon insults over or despises his fallen brother, in comparison of himself, and is not compassionate and friendly to him; <span class="ital">he deceiveth himself </span>— Is entirely mistaken in the judgment he forms of his own state and character. <span class="ital">But let every man </span>— To prevent so great an evil; <span class="ital">prove his own work </span>— Narrowly examine all he is, all he has, and all he doth; <span class="ital">and then </span>— If his spirit and conduct be found agreeable to the rule God has given him, and so be approved by God; <span class="ital">he shall have rejoicing in himself </span>— In what God has done for him and in him, by pardoning and renewing him, and enabling him to walk before him in all well-pleasing; he will find matter of comfort in knowing that his heart is right with God, and that he has his conversation according to the gospel; <span class="ital">and not in another </span>— That is, not in the applause he receives from another, nor in glorying over others, as inferior to himself in gifts or graces, in holiness or usefulness. <span class="ital">For every man — </span>In the day of final judgment; <span class="ital">shall bear his own burden </span>— Shall give an account of himself to God; shall answer for his own actions only, and not for those of others.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 We are to bear one another's burdens. So we shall fulfil the law of Christ. This obliges to mutual forbearance and compassion towards each other, agreeably to his example. It becomes us to bear one another's burdens, as fellow-travellers. It is very common for a man to look upon himself as wiser and better than other men, and as fit to dictate to them. Such a one deceives himself; by pretending to what he has not, he puts a cheat upon himself, and sooner or later will find the sad effects. This will never gain esteem, either with God or men. Every one is advised to prove his own work. The better we know our own hearts and ways, the less shall we despise others, and the more be disposed to help them under infirmities and afflictions. How light soever men's sins seem to them when committed, yet they will be found a heavy burden, when they come to reckon with God about them. No man can pay a ransom for his brother; and sin is a burden to the soul. It is a spiritual burden; and the less a man feels it to be such, the more cause has he to suspect himself. Most men are dead in their sins, and therefore have no sight or sense of the spiritual burden of sin. Feeling the weight and burden of our sins, we must seek to be eased thereof by the Saviour, and be warned against every sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bear ye one another's burdens - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1</a>. Bear with each other; help each other in the divine life. The sense is, that every man has special temptations and easily besetting sins, which constitute a heavy burden. We should aid each other in regard to these, and help one another to overcome them.<p>And so fulfil the law of Christ - The special law of Christ, requiring us to love one another; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>. This was the distinguishing law of the Redeemer; and they could in no way better fulfil it than by aiding each other in the divine life. The law of Christ would not allow us to reproach the offender, or to taunt him, or to rejoice in his fall. We should help him to take up his load of infirmities, and sustain him by our counsels, our exhortations, and our prayers. Christians, conscious of their infirmities, have a right to the sympathy and the prayers of their brethren. They should not be cast off to a cold and heartless world; a world rejoicing over their fall, and ready to brand them as hypocrites. They should be pressed to the warm bosom of brotherly kindness; and prayer should be made to ascend without ceasing around an erring and a fallen brother. Is this the case in regard to all who bear the Christian name? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Which may be understood either of sins, which are heavy burdens to sensible sinners, to all that are partakers of the grace of God; Christ is only able to bear these burdens, so as to remove them and take them away, which he has done by his blood, sacrifice, and satisfaction; saints bear one another's, not by making satisfaction for them, which they are not able to do, nor by conniving at them, and suffering them upon them, which they should not do, but by gently reproving them, by comforting them when overpressed with guilt, by sympathizing with them in their sorrow, by praying to God for to manifest his pardoning grace to them, and by forgiving them themselves, so far as they are faults committed against them: or else the frailties and infirmities of weak saints, which are troublesome, and apt to make uneasy, are meant; and which are to be bore by the strong, by making themselves easy with them, and by accommodating themselves to their weakness, and by abridging themselves of some liberties, which otherwise might be lawfully taken by them; or afflictions may be designed, which are grievous to the flesh, and are bore by others, when they administer help and relief under them, whether in a temporal or spiritual way; and when they condole them, and sympathize with them, bear a part with them, and make others' griefs and sorrows their own: <p>and so fulfil the law of Christ; which is the law of love to one another, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a> in opposition to the law of Moses, the judaizing Galatians were so fond of, and by which Christ's disciples may be distinguished from those of Moses, or any others. This is a law or doctrine which Christ has clearly taught, and recovered from the false glosses of the Pharisees; it is his new commandment, which he has strengthened and enforced by his own example in dying for his people, and which he, by his Spirit, inscribes upon their hearts.

The <span class="ital">mutual bearing</span> of moral burdens is the <span class="ital">mutual, loving participation in</span> another’s <span class="ital">feeling of guilt</span>, a weeping with those that weep in a <span class="ital">moral</span> point of view, by means of which moral sympathy the pressure of the feeling of guilt is reciprocally lightened.[250] As to this <span class="ital">fellowship in suffering</span>, comp. the example of the apostle himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-29.htm" title="Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?">2 Corinthians 11:29</a>.

What Paul here requires, is conceived by him as the <span class="ital">culminating point</span> of such a service. He speaks of the <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> of Christ in relation to the Mosaic law (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-14.htm" title="For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Galatians 5:14</a>), which had in the case of the Galatians—and how much to the detriment of the sympathy of love—attained an estimation which, on the part of Christians, was not at all due to it; they desired to be <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ νόμον</span>, and thereby lost the <span class="greekheb">ἔννομον Χριστοῦ εἶναι</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-21.htm" title="To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.">1 Corinthians 9:21</a>).

These words, <span class="ital">burdens</span> and <span class="ital">the law</span>, involve a Mimesis[59] in reference to the Galatians, who were eagerly trying to come under <span class="ital">the burden of the law</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[59] See App. An allusion to the opinions or words of him whom you wish to correct.—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bear ye one another's burdens</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">carry ye</span>, or, <span class="accented">be ready to carry</span>, <span class="accented">the heavy loads of one another.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> gives it especial prominence; as it stands here it seems pregnant with the exhortation, look not every man only at his own griefs, but at the griefs also of others" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>). The word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, weight, points to an excessive weight, such as it is a toil to carry. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-12.htm">Matthew 20:12</a>, "who have borne the burden (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) and heat of the day." So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>, "weight of glory," the phrase, suggested by the double sense of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">kabhod</span>, indicates the enormous greatness of the future glory. The supposition that the apostle was glancing at the burden of Mosaical observances, superseded as a matter for care on our part by the burdens of our brethren, seems far-fetched. These "heavy loads" are those which a man brings upon himself by acts of transgression: such as an uneasy conscience; difficulties in his domestic, social, or Church relations; pecuniary embarrassments; or other. But the precept seems to go beyond the requirements of the particular case of a peccant brother which has suggested it, and to take in all the needs, spiritual or secular, which we are subject to. (For <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of carrying a toilsome burden, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>.)  <span class="cmt_word">And so fulfil the law of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> [or, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">and so fulfil</span> (or, <span class="accented">ye shall fulfil</span>) <span class="accented">the law of Christ.</span> The sense comes to much the same, whether in the Greek we read the future indicative or the aorist imperative. If the imperative be retained, it yet adds no new element of precept to the foregoing; the clause so read <span class="accented">prescribes</span> the fulfilment of Christ's law in the particular form of bearing one another's burdens. If we read the future, the clause <span class="accented">affirms</span> that in so doing we shall fulfil his law; which in the other case is implied. Many have supposed the word "law" to be here used for a specific commandment; as for example Christ's new commandment that we should love one another, So St. James (it. 8) writes of the "royal law." St. Paul, however, never uses the term in this sense in his own writing, though in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 8:10; 10:16), the plural "laws" occurs in citation from Jeremiah. It seems better to take it of the whole moral institution of Christ, whether conveyed in distinct precept or in his example and spirit of action. Compare with the present passage the advice which St. Paul gives the "strong" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1-4</a>), that they should bear (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as here, "carry") the infirmities of the weak, and not wish to please themselves; after Christ's pattern set forth in prophetical Scripture, of old time written in order to instruct us how we should act. It has been often observed that the phrase, "the law of Christ," was selected with allusion to the stir now being made among the Galatians respecting the Law of Moses. "Satisfy ye the requirements of the Law - not of Moses which some are prating about, but the law of Christ, a more perfect law than that other, and more our proper con-corn." Possibly the words <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> were added as a pointed surprise of style - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, as the scholiasts on Aristophanes are wont to express it - "and thus fulfil the law - of Christ!" <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>One another's burdens (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;)<p>The emphasis is on one another's, in contrast with the selfishness which leaves others to take care of themselves.
