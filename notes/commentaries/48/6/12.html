By suppressing this side of Christian teaching, the Judaisers could easily obtain toleration for their other tenets. If, on the other hand, they were to emphasise it, the full weight of persecution would fall upon them—its ostensible ground being the doctrine of a crucified Messiah. Accordingly, they persuaded as many of the Galatians as they could to accept circumcision, and made the most of this propagandist zeal to their Jewish neighbours.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/6-12.htm" title="As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ....">Galatians 6:12-13</a></span>.

The apostle’s meaning is, that the false teachers wished to appear well in the eyes of the Jews, on account of their attachment to the law of Moses, which in other passages he terms <span class="ital">the flesh, </span>in opposition to the spiritual dispensation of the gospel. <span class="ital">Only lest,</span> &c. — As if he had said, They do not act thus with a single eye to the glory of God, or from a principle of conscience, but <span class="ital">only lest they should</span> <span class="ital">suffer persecution </span>— From the unbelieving Jews; <span class="ital">for the cross of Christ </span>— For maintaining that faith in a crucified Saviour is alone sufficient for justification. It is well known that the Jewish chief priests and elders were great persecutors of the disciples of Christ, and began their persecution very early. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-22.htm" title="These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.">John 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-22.htm" title="Philip comes and tells Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.">John 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-38.htm" title="And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, sought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave.

The false teachers, therefore, of whom the apostle speaks, to recommend themselves to these rulers at Jerusalem, who stirred up the unbelieving Jews every where against the Christians, fell upon the scheme of blending Judaism with the gospel; and, as the apostle informs us, urged the Gentiles to receive circumcision, merely that they themselves might not be persecuted for the gospel doctrine of salvation through a crucified Messiah. <span class="ital">For neither they themselves </span>— Who are circumcised, and so are solemnly obliged to observe the whole of it; <span class="ital">keep the law </span>— Namely, in other points of greater importance; so far are they from a real zeal for it, or from acting uprightly and conscientiously in this matter; <span class="ital">but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh </span>— May boast of you as their proselytes, and make a merit of this with the other Jews.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:12-15 Proud, vain, and carnal hearts, are content with just so much religion as will help to keep up a fair show. But the apostle professes his own faith, hope, and joy; and that his principal glory was in the cross of Christ. By which is here meant, his sufferings and death on the cross, the doctrine of salvation by a crucified Redeemer. By Christ, or by the cross of Christ, the world is crucified to the believer, and he to the world. The more we consider the sufferings of the Redeemer from the world, the less likely shall we be to love the world. The apostle was as little affected by its charms, as a beholder would be by any thing which had been graceful in the face of a crucified person, when he beholds it blackened in the agonies of death. He was no more affected by the objects around him, than one who is expiring would be struck with any of the prospects his dying eyes might view from the cross on which he hung. And as to those who have truly believed in Christ Jesus, all things are counted as utterly worthless compared with him. There is a new creation; old things are passed away, and new views and dispositions are brought in under the regenerating influences of God the Holy Spirit. Believers are brought into a new world, and being created in Christ Jesus unto good works, are formed to a life of holiness. It is a change of mind and heart, whereby we are enabled to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to live to God; and where this inward, practical religion is wanting, outward professions, or names, will never stand in any stead.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh - To be distinguished for their conformity to external rites and customs. To be known for their zeal in this cause. They sought to show their zeal by making converts, and by inducing others also to conform to those customs. Paul here refers, doubtless, to the Jewish teachers, and he says that their main object was to evince their zeal in the observance of rites and ceremonies.<p>They constrain you - You who are Gentiles. They insist on circumcision as indispensable to salvation.<p>Only lest they should suffer persecution - It is not from any true love for the cause of religion. It is, that they may avoid persecution from the Jews. If they should renounce the doctrine which taught that circumcision was indispensable, they would be exposed to the rage of the Jews, and would suffer persecution. Rather than do this, they make a show of great, zeal in inducing others to be circumcised.<p>For the cross of Christ - From attachment to the cause of a crucified Saviour. If they insisted on entire dependence on the merits of his blood, and renounced all dependence on rites and ceremonies, they would suffer persecution. This verse shows the true cause of the zeal which the Judaizing teachers evinced. It was the fear of persecution. It was the want of independence and boldness in maintaining the doctrine that people were to be saved only by the merits of the Lord Jesus. By attempting to blend together the doctrines of Judaism and Christianity; by maintaining that the observance of the Jewish rites was necessary, and yet that Jesus was the Messiah, they endeavored to keep in with both parties; and thus to escape the opposition of the Jews. It was an unhallowed compromise It was an attempt to blend things together which could not be united. One must really displace the other. If people depended on the rites of Moses, they had no need of dependence on the Messiah; if they professed to depend on him, then to rely on anything else was in fact to disown and reject him. Embracing the one system was in fact renouncing the other. Such is the argument of Paul; and such his solemn remonstrance against embracing any doctrine which would obscure the glory of simple dependence on the cross of Christ. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The apostle saith, that these false teachers, who so zealously urged circumcision upon this Gentile church, did it for the avoiding the danger of persecution; which they saw would follow their standing fast in their gospel liberty, and not bringing themselves under the law: which persecution, he tacitly hinteth, ought not to be so industriously shunned and avoided, because it was for Christ’s sake, who had endured the cross for them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/galatians/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh,.... By whom are meant the false apostles, who are here described, and their views, aims, and ends, opened and exposed. These were very desirous to carry a good face of things outwardly, of appearing outwardly righteous before men, and to be accounted so by them; and therefore did all they to be seen of them, and gain applause from them. They were such, as the Syriac version renders the words, as desired  "to glory in the flesh"; their carnal descent and privileges, in their being Hebrews, the seed of Abraham, of the stock of Israel; and in the circumcision of their flesh; or in their external gifts, their natural parts, acquired abilities, learning, eloquence, and the like: moreover, as the Vulgate Latin version reads, "they were willing to please in the flesh": to please carnal men, Israel after the flesh, in carnal and fleshly things; they sought not to please God or Christ, but men, and so were not the servants of either. They were desirous, as the Arabic version renders the words, "that honour should be done them in" "the flesh"; they sought external glory from men, and to be outwardly and publicly honoured by them; and all their religion was a mere outward show, a piece of pageantry; which lay in the observation of carnal ordinances, such as respected meats and drinks, circumcision in the flesh, and other carnal commandments: <p>they constrain you to be circumcised; not by using any outward force and violence; but either by their example, which had great influence, as that has both with respect to the embracing of evil principles, and giving in to bad practices: or by their doctrine; the arguments they made use of to persuade them to it, being formed and managed with great art and subtlety, wrought strongly upon them: or rather by overawing them, with threatenings of hell and damnation; affirming, that unless they were circumcised, they could not be saved: and their end was, <p>only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ, or "by the cross of Christ"; meaning either the manner in which persecution might be suffered, as by being reproached, ill used, and suffering death as Christ did; or by bearing the cross of affliction and tribulation Christ has appointed for, and calls his followers to; or else the object for which it is endured, the preaching of the cross, or the Gospel of salvation by a crucified Christ; for this doctrine, and the preaching and professing of it, and living a life answerable to it, always bring persecution with them: and that persecution, which is more especially here regarded, was what came from the Jews, who in general were greatly offended at the preaching of a crucified Christ; and particularly from the professing part among them, who though they believed in Christ, and were not displeased at preaching in his name; yet were greatly affronted at, and highly resented, and as much as in them lay, by reproaches and hard censures, and the like, persecuted those who opposed circumcision, and the ceremonies of the law; and to avoid the ill will, contempt, and persecution of these, the false teachers preached up circumcision, and obliged their people to submit to it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As many as desire to make a <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> fair shew in <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> cross of Christ.</span><p>(h) He sets a fair show against the truth.<p>(i) In the keeping of ceremonies.<p>(k) For the preaching of him that was crucified.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/galatians/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm" title="As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.">Galatians 6:12</a>.[265] <span class="ital">All those whose wish and will are directed to making a fair show in the flesh</span>, that is, to the having a specious appearance, while they are involved in fleshly habits,—<span class="ital">this</span> class of men <span class="ital">force circumcision upon you</span>, and they <span class="ital">do so solely for the reason that they may not bring on themselves persecution on account of the cross of Christ</span>.

Comp. Wieseler. And how feeble and inexpressive, when placed at the commencement of so energetic a passage, would be the description of the misleaders which this interpretation would yield! Holsten interprets in a similar way, but developes the sense more accurately, and takes <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΣΑΡΚΊ</span></span></span> as the sphere in which the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕὐΠΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> manifests itself, “all who desire a fair show <span class="ital">in the fleshly domain;</span>” this applies in the concrete to <span class="ital">circumcision</span>, which could have true significance only as a sign of inward righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a> f.), but to which these persons adhered “<span class="ital">for its fair show of righteousness</span>.” But it is not until <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-13.htm" title="For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.">Galatians 6:13</a> that <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> obtains its reference in harmony with the text to circumcision; in respect to which, moreover, the idea, that circumcision is the <span class="ital">seal of righteousness</span>, is not at all intimated in the connection of our passage. Lastly, Chrysostom and his successors, Erasmus, Calvin, Estius, Grotius, and others, have assigned to <span class="greekheb">ἑν σαρκί</span> the unmeaning sense <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡʼ ἈΝΘΡΏΠΟΙς</span></span></span>; and Hofmann has arrived at the trifling interpretation, that the idea meant was “<span class="ital">a pleasing cheerfulness of outward appearance, springing from and testifying to a natural amiability</span>, to which the opponents of the apostle aspired: <span class="ital">they would fain appear with the expression of natural amiability</span>.” Thus the description of the opponents placed at the head of this final outburst, so full of holy severity and indignation, would simply amount to the assertion of an amiable <span class="ital">bonhommie</span> by which they were impelled.

They had probably, like the Jewish Christians at Antioch (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-13.htm" title="And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.">Galatians 2:13</a>), been guilty of inconsistency in their practice: but Paul apparently relies also on his argument in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm" title="Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.">Galatians 2:16</a> that Jewish converts had by the mere act of embracing Christ confessed their own inability to keep the Law, and could not therefore be sincere in preaching to others obedience to its rules.—<span class="greekheb">τῷ σταυρῷ</span>.

The correct translation seems to be, <span class="ital">persecuted with the cross, i.e.</span>, the cross of outward suffering which was in those days the lot of so many converted Jews, and notably of Paul himself.

They were Gentile Christians and not Jews; this appears from their not themselves wishing to keep the Law; for if they had been Jews, the external observance of the Law, being natural to them from their infancy, would have been with them a matter of course: St. Paul himself would probably not have urged them to relinquish it. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is not found by the critics in any earlier Greek writer, though the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, fair-faced, is used of "specious" answers in Herodotus (7:168), and "specious words" conjoined with "fables" in Demosthenes ('De Corinthians,' p. 277). Aristophanes uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> ('Nub.,' 362) to "<span class="accented">carry</span> a solemn and worshipful face." The notion of falsity, plainly hinted by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, reminds us, Bishop Lightfoot observes, of our Lord's words respecting whited sepulchres, which "outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). Compare the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, face, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>, "<span class="accented">glory</span> in <span class="accented">appearance</span>, and not in heart." As the aorist of verbs denoting a certain state frequently expresses an entrance upon such a state (see <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a> and note), it probably is intimated that the persons referred to were conscious that their "<span class="accented">outward</span> appearance" was hitherto not acceptable to Jewish minds, but that they now were desirous of making it so. Time had been when they did not care so much about it. "In the flesh." This word "flesh" not unfrequently designates men's condition as unmodified by the Spirit of God; as when the apostle speaks of "<span class="accented">being</span> in the flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-8.htm">Romans 8:8, 9</a>): thence also circumstances or relations pertaining to this unspiritual condition, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3, 4</a>; where the apostle speaks of "having confidence in the flesh," and goes on, in vers. 5, 6, to enumerate some of those circumstances or relations. Thus, again, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>, "ye, the Gentiles in the flesh," that is, who in that state of things in which men lived before the spiritual economy intervened, were the "uncircumcision (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)," while the Jews were the "<span class="accented">circumcision."</span> But as the distinction between these two classes was signalized by an external corporeal mark, the apostle in that passage immediately after uses the expression, "in the flesh," in a varied sense, with reference to this latter, "that which is called circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands." With similar variation of meaning the word "<span class="accented">flesh"</span> is used here. The Christians spoken of, losing sight of the cross of Christ and the Spirit's work, were becoming possessed by feelings belonging to the old "<span class="accented">carnal"</span> relations between Jews and Gentiles, and so were making it their ambition to figure with advantage in the eyes of the circumcision, as well as to escape their enmity. And then, as in the passage just referred to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>), the apostle passes from this sense of the phrase, "in the flesh," to another relating to corporeal flesh; for this he does in the next verse, in the words, "that they may glory in your flesh." <span class="cmt_word">They constrain you to be circumcised</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">these compel you to be circumcised.</span> "Compel;" the same verb as was used above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>) of St. Peter's attitude towards the Gentile believers at Antioch. <span class="accented">As here applied</span>, <span class="accented">it means</span> "<span class="accented">advise</span>," "<span class="accented">urge</span>," argue for it as right and necessary for salvation, insist upon it as a condition of friendship. "These;" not, perhaps, meaning "<span class="accented">these</span> only," "<span class="accented">none</span> but these;" it appears enough to suppose that the apostle, from definite information which he had received, was persuaded that some of those who took the lead in urging onward the Judaizing movement were led to join in it by the cowardly motives here described. With indignant scorn, he says," As surely as a man wants to stand well with the world, so surely will he be found with these circumcisers."<span class="cmt_word">Only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> [Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>]); <span class="accented">only that they may not by means of the cross of Christ suffer persecution.</span> "Only that;" that is, for no other reason than that. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> is thrust out of its proper position in the sentence (which is that assigned to it in the Textus Receptus) by the fervent of the writer's feelings. To himself the cross of Christ seemed the centre of all glory and blessedness; to be connected with it he would be well pleased to suffer martyrdom; but these men could be well content to shelve it out of sight, and, in fact, were doing so; and  what for? because the Jews did not like it, and they did not wish to get into trouble by offending <span class="accented">them</span>! A grand disdain prompts the apostle, at the cost of impairing the smooth run of the sentence, to (as it were) balance against each other the "cross of Christ" and "not being persecuted." The construction of the dative to express "by means of," that by which a certain result is brought about, is not very common; but we have it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and ibid., 30, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. Our attention is in this passage again drawn to the manner in which the Jews regarded "the word of the cross" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>), as that "word" was unfolded by St. Paul and received by his disciples among the Gentiles. The great point of offence (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in the apostle's teaching respecting it lay in his presenting its pollution in the view of the Law, as inferring the abrogation of the ceremonial institute itself. On this account the Jews could not abide him nor those who attached themselves to him as their teacher, though in a degree able to put up with Christians not anti-Judaists. To the Galatians he had presented "Christ crucified" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>) as <span class="accented">he</span> saw him to be, and they had accepted the doctrine. But now some, at least, of them were beginning to feel uneasy at observing how the Jews in their neighbourhood regarded Paul and those who attached themselves closely to Paul. Had not the Jews (they felt) high claims to consideration? Were they not the original depositaries of the oracles of God? Was not their religion venerable for its antiquity, magnificent in its temple and ritual, and in origin Divine? To these new converts from the gross spiritual darkness and degradation of heathenism, some of them, perhaps, drawn from it originally by the teaching of non-Christian Jews, the adherents to the ancient faith would naturally appear entitled to high respect - respect which they themselves were also not backward in claiming (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-19.htm">Romans 2:19, 20</a>). When the personal influence exercised upon their minds by the holy love and fervour of the apostle had through his absence begun to wane, they also, we may imagine, began to get disheartened, by feeling that their Christian discipleship was viewed with disfavour by their Jewish neighbours, by reason of its Pauline complexion; that on this account the Jews looked upon themselves, though worshippers of the same God, as unworthy of notice; nay, were even disposed to point them out to the surrounding heathens, only too willing to follow up the hint, as proper objects of contempt and ill usage (see for illustration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18.htm">Acts 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14-16</a>). And herewith we have to bear in mind also that Judaism was in Roman jurisprudence treated as a tolerated religion (<span class="accented">religio licita</span>); and that, as long as Christians were regarded as belonging to a sect or branch of Judaism, they might seem to be entitled, in the eyes of Roman law, to the same toleration as the Jews themselves enjoyed. But if the Jews cast them off or disowned them they might forfeit such immunity, and become liable to be treated, not only by mobs, but by the Roman law itself, as offenders. The persons, then, here censured by the apostle may be supposed to have pursued the course they did with the idea that, by making themselves acceptable to the Jews through the adoption to a limited extent of Jewish ceremonies, and especially through the acceptance in their own person and the urging upon others of circumcision, they would relieve themselves of "the offence of the cross" (ch. 5:4). Without ceasing to be Christians, they would wipe themselves clear of the odium which with the Jews attached to Paul and those who held with Paul. Such seems to be the situation to which St. Paul's words allude. Bishop Lightfoot interprets it somewhat differently. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>To make a fair show (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>N.T.o. oClass. olxx.<p>In the flesh (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;)<p>Qualifying the verb to make a fair show.
