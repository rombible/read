Let a man judge his own work, not by comparison with others, but by the ideal standard, then he will see what it is worth and how much he has to boast of. His boasting will be at least real, and not based upon any delusive comparisons. He must stand or fall by himself. He must bear the weight of his own virtues and his own sins. By them he will be judged, and not by any fancied superiority or inferiority to others. For the thought, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/10-12.htm" title="For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.">2Corinthians 10:12-14</a>.<p>(4) <span class= "bld">Prove.</span>—<span class= "ital">Test,</span> or <span class= "ital">examine,</span> by reference to an objective standard.

His standard will be absolute and not relative, and the amount of his boasting will be proportioned accordingly. He will not seek to excuse himself by dwelling upon his neighbour’s weaknesses.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-5 We are to bear one another's burdens. So we shall fulfil the law of Christ. This obliges to mutual forbearance and compassion towards each other, agreeably to his example. It becomes us to bear one another's burdens, as fellow-travellers. It is very common for a man to look upon himself as wiser and better than other men, and as fit to dictate to them. Such a one deceives himself; by pretending to what he has not, he puts a cheat upon himself, and sooner or later will find the sad effects. This will never gain esteem, either with God or men. Every one is advised to prove his own work. The better we know our own hearts and ways, the less shall we despise others, and the more be disposed to help them under infirmities and afflictions. How light soever men's sins seem to them when committed, yet they will be found a heavy burden, when they come to reckon with God about them. No man can pay a ransom for his brother; and sin is a burden to the soul. It is a spiritual burden; and the less a man feels it to be such, the more cause has he to suspect himself. Most men are dead in their sins, and therefore have no sight or sense of the spiritual burden of sin. Feeling the weight and burden of our sins, we must seek to be eased thereof by the Saviour, and be warned against every sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But let every man prove - That is, try or examine in a proper manner. Let him form a proper estimate of what is due to himself, according to his real character. Let him compare himself with the word of God, and the infallible rule which he has given, and by which we are to be judged in the last great day; compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-28.htm">1 Corinthians 11:28</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a> note.<p>His own work - What he does. Let him form a fair and impartial estimate of his own character.<p>And then shall he have rejoicing - That is, he will be appropriately rewarded, and will meet with no disappointment. The man who forms an improper estimate of his own character will be sure to be disappointed. The man who examines himself, and who forms no extravagant expectation in regard to what is due to himself, will be appropriately rewarded, and will be made happy. If, by the careful examination of himself, he finds his life to be virtuous, and his course of conduct pure; if he has done no wrong to others, and if he finds evidence that he is a child of God, then he will have cause of rejoicing.<p>In himself alone - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-14.htm">Proverbs 14:14</a>; "A good man shall be satisfied from himself." The sentiment is, that he will find in himself a source of pure joy. He will not be dependent on the applause of others for happiness. In an approving conscience; in the evidence of the favor of God; in an honest effort to lead a pure and holy life, he will have happiness. The source of his joys will be within; and he will not be dependent, as the man of ambition, and the man who thinks of himself more highly than he ought, will, on the favors of a capricious multitude, and on the breath of popular applause.<p>And not in another - He will not be dependent on others for happiness. Here is the true secret of happiness. It consists:<p>(1) In not forming an improper estimate of ourselves; in knowing just what we are, and what is due to us; in not thinking ourselves to be something, when we are nothing.<p>(2) in leading such a life that it may be examined to the core, that we may know exactly what we are without being distressed or pained. That is, in having a good conscience, and in the honest and faithful discharge of our duty to God and man.<p>(3) in not being dependent on the fickle applause of the world for our comfort. The man who has no internal resources, and who has no approving conscience; who is happy only when others smile, and miserable when they frown, is a man who can have no security for enjoyment. The man who has a good conscience, and who enjoys the favor of God, and the hope of heaven, carries with him the source of perpetual joy. He cannot be deprived of it. His purse may be taken, and his house robbed, but the highwayman cannot rob him of his comforts. He carries with him an unfailing source of happiness when abroad, and the same source of happiness abides with him at home; he bears it into society, and it remains with him in solitude; it is his companion when in health, and when surrounded by his friends, and it is no less his companion when his friends leave him, and when he lies upon a bed of death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. his own work&#8212;not merely his own opinion of himself.<p>have rejoicing in himself alone&#8212;Translate, "Have his (matter for) glorying in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another (namely, not in regard to his neighbor, by comparing himself with whom, he has fancied he has matter for boasting as that neighbor's superior)." Not that really a man by looking to "himself alone" is likely to find cause for glorying in himself. Nay, in Ga 6:5, he speaks of a "burden" or load, not of matter for glorying, as what really belongs to each man. But he refers to the idea those whom he censures had of themselves: they thought they had cause for "glorying" in themselves, but it all arose from unjust self-conceited comparison of themselves with others, instead of looking at home. The only true glorying, if glorying it is to be called, is in the testimony of a good conscience, glorying in the cross of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let every man prove his own work:</span> the apostle, by a man’s <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">own work</span> here, understands his own actions and manners, which he would have every man to busy himself to search, try, and examine by the Divine rule, whether they be conformable to the will of God, yea or no; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and then, </span> he saith, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another; </span> a man shall (if he findeth his work such as is agreeable to the will of God) have a cause to rejoice in himself; not in the merit or perfection of his works, but in his own works; not in others; that is, he shall rejoice in something which God hath wrought in and by him, and not in others. This the apostle wisely propounds, as a means to bring a man to know his own measures; it being a great error for men to measure themselves by the measures of other men, their perfections by others’ imperfections. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/galatians/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But let every man prove his own work,.... Not concern himself about the actions and works of others; let him review his own heart and actions; let him examine, try, and prove his whole conduct in life by the rule of God's word, when he will find enough at home, without bearing hard upon, and censuring others: <p>and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another; which is either ironically said, he will then see what reason he has to rejoice and glory in his own works, and vaunt over others, and to boast of his performances, and despise others; so far from it, that he will have reason to be ashamed of himself, and to own and acknowledge his unworthiness and unprofitableness: or if, upon such a review, examination, and probation of his works, it shall appear that he has had his conversation in the world, by the grace of God, in simplicity and godly sincerity, this testimony of his conscience will be his rejoicing; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>. He may rejoice "in himself", in his own works, as the fruits of grace, but not as the effects of his own power and strength; and may glory and boast of them before men, in vindication of his cause and character, and as evidences of the truth of grace, but not before God, as if they were the matter of his justification and acceptance: <p>and not in another; that is fallen into sin; making use of his sins and faults to set off himself, and to increase his own praise and condemnation; rejoicing in this, that he is better than others, and is not, as the Pharisee said, as other men are, as wicked as they, or has not fallen into such sins as others have done. He will have occasion to take such a method as this, if his conversation will bear the test; he will have rejoicing in the testimony of his own conscience, and will have no need to compare himself with others; his glorying will be on account of his own actions, and not through a comparison of other men's. This no ways contradicts a man's glorying in God, and rejoicing in Christ Jesus alone, in the business of salvation. It only regards a man's glorying before men, in a modest and humble manner, of what he is enabled to do, by the grace of God, without fetching in the characters of other men that are wicked, or have fallen, to illustrate his own. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/galatians/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-4.htm" title="But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.">Galatians 6:4</a>.

Know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, and always). Nearest to the view of Koppe in <span class="ital">sense</span> come those of Winer: “non tantas in se ipso reperiet laudes, quibus apud alios quoque glorietur;” of Usteri: “then will he have to glory towards himself alone, and not towards others,”—a delicate way of turning the thought: “<span class="ital">then he will discover in himself faults and weaknesses sufficient to make him think of himself modestly;</span>” and of Wieseler, “he will be silent toward others as to his <span class="greekheb">καύχημα</span>.” But in accordance with the context, after the requirement of self-examination, the most natural sense for <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> (on account of the antithesis, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἑαυτὸν</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν ἕτερον</span>) is: <span class="ital">in respect to, as regards;</span> moreover, in the above-named interpretations, neither the singular nor the article in <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἕτερον</span> obtains its due weight. The sentence must be explained: <span class="ital">then will he have cause to glory merely as regards himself, and not as regards the other;</span> that is, then will he have cause to boast merely in respect of good of his own, which he may possibly find on this self-examination, and not in reference to the other, with whom otherwise he would advantageously compare himself. Castalio aptly remarks: “probitas in re, non in collatione;” and Grotius: “gaudebit recto sui examine, non deteriorum comparatione,”—as, for instance, was done by the Pharisee, who compared himself with robbers, adulterers, etc., instead of simply trying his own action, and not boasting as he looked to others, whom he brought into comparison. Comp. Calvin and others; also Reithmayr. <span class="greekheb">καύχημα</span> <span class="ital">with the article</span> denotes, not <span class="ital">absolute glory</span> (Matthies), which no one has (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm" title="For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;">Romans 3:23</a>), but the <span class="ital">relevant</span> cause for the <span class="greekheb">καυχᾶσθαι</span> which he finds in himself, so far as he does so, on that trial of his own work. It is therefore the <span class="greekheb">καύχημα</span>, supposed or conceived by Paul, as the result of the examination in the several cases; Bernhardy, p. 15. This relative character of the idea removes the seeming inconsistency with <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-3.htm" title="For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.">Galatians 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-5.htm" title="For every man shall bear his own burden.">Galatians 6:5</a> (in opposition to de Wette), and excludes all untrue and impious boasting; but the taking <span class="greekheb">καύχημα ἔχειν</span> <span class="ital">ironically</span> (against which Calvin justly pronounces), or as <span class="ital">mimesis</span> (Bengel and others; also Olshausen: “a thorough self-examination reveals so much in one’s own heart, that there can be no question of glory at all”),1[251] is forbidden even by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΟὐΚ ΕἸς ΤῸΝ ἝΤΕΡΟΝ</span></span></span>. Hofmann interprets, although similarly in the main, yet without irony, and with a more exact unfolding of the purport: “<span class="ital">while otherwise he found that he might glory as he contrasted his own person with others, he will now in respect to the good which he finds in himself, seeing that he also discovers certain things in himself which are not good, have cause to glory only towards himself—himself, namely, who has done the good, as against himself, who has done what is not good</span>.” But in this interpretation the ideas, which are to form the key to the meaning, are gratuitously imported; a paraphrase so subtle, and yet so clumsy, especially of the words <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἑαυτὸν μόνον</span>, could not be expected to occur to the reader. More simply, but introducing a different kind of extraneous matter, de Wette interprets: “<span class="ital">and then he will for himself alone</span> (to his own joy) <span class="ital">have the glory</span> (if he has any such thing, which is evidently called in question) <span class="ital">not for others</span> (in order thereby to provoke and challenge them).” But how arbitrary it is to assign to <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> two references so entirely different, and with regard to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΎΧΗΜΑ</span></span></span> to foist in the idea: “if he has <span class="ital">aught such</span>”! A most excellent example of the <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἑαυτὸν <span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΌΝΟΝ ΤῸ ΚΑΎΧΗΜΑ ἜΧΕΙΝ</span></span></span> is afforded by Paul himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-12.htm" title="For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>.

The distinction which ordinarily obtains between verbals of the form of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and those of the form of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> appears to hold good also in respect to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the substantive seems to mean "boast," that is, what is said in boasting, as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the action of uttering a beast. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, with its derivatives - a favourite term with St. Paul  - often appears to mean "rejoicing" rather than" boasting" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>); but it seems desirable as a rule to render it by "glorying," with the understanding that the writer has frequently the joyous state of feeling more prominently in his view than the utterance of self-gratulation. What the apostle meant by "having one's ground of glorying in regard to one's own self alone," is well illustrated by what he says respecting himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>,  "Our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward." he had been himself in the habit of testing his conduct and spirit by the standard of Christ's law; and this was the fruit. <span class="cmt_word">And not in another</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">and not in regard to that neighbour of his.</span> The article probably points to that neighbour with whom he has been comparing himself; and so, perhaps, also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-1.htm">Romans 2:1</a>. But it may be simply "his neighbour;" "the man who is other than himself;" as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-1.htm">1 Corinthians 6:1</a> and 1 Cor 10:24, in neither of which passages has any particular "other person" been before referred to. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Prove (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;)<p>In Class. of assaying metals Comp. lxx, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a>; Sir. 2:5: also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>.
