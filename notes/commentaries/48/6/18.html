The blessings are, peace and mercy. Peace with God and our conscience, and all the comforts of this life, as far as they are needful. And mercy, an interest in the free love and favour of God in Christ, the spring and fountain of all other blessings. The written word of God is the rule we are to go by, both in its doctrines and precepts. May his grace ever be with our spirit, to sanctify, quicken, and cheer us, and may we always be ready to maintain the honour of that which is indeed our life. The apostle had in his body the marks of the Lord Jesus, the scars of wounds from persecuting enemies, for his cleaving to Christ, and the doctrine of the gospel. The apostle calls the Galatians his brethren, therein he shows his humility and his tender affection for them; and he takes his leave with a very serious prayer, that they might enjoy the favour of Christ Jesus, both in its effects and in its evidences. We need desire no more to make us happy than the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. The apostle does not pray that the law of Moses, or the righteousness of works, but that the grace of Christ, might be with them; that it might be in their hearts and with their spirits, quickening, comforting, and strengthening them: to all which he sets his Amen; signifying his desire that so it might be, and his faith that so it would be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Brethren, the grace ... - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

So he calls them, to testify his affection for them, notwithstanding their infirmity and instability, and the roughness with which he had treated them; and to show his great humility and condescension in owning the relation, and putting them on a level with himself, which the pride of the false teachers would not suffer them to do. <p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit: which is his concluding benediction and usual salutation and token in all his epistles: he wishes that more gifts of grace might be bestowed upon them; that the Gospel of the grace of God might be continued with them; that the love of Christ might be shed abroad in their hearts; that they might receive out of his fulness grace for grace; that there might be an increase of grace in their souls; that it might abound in them, and they grow in the exercise of it: he does not pray that the law of Moses, or the righteousness of works, but that the grace of Christ might be with them; not in the mere notion of it, but in the spiritual experience of it; that it might be in their hearts, and with their spirits, quickening, comforting, and strengthening them; making them more spiritual and evangelical in their frames and duties, and freeing them from a carnal and legal spirit: to all which he sets his <p>Amen; signifying his desire that so it might be, and his faith that so it would be.

The pre-eatery imperative "be," which, of course, is to be supplied, clothes a friendly wish in the pious form of a prayer. "With," the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> which, in the Septuagint, represents the Hebrew '<span class="accented">im</span>, meaning "present to help," is illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-4.htm">Ruth 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>; 28:90; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-32.htm">John 16:32</a>.

It expresses his desire that Christ's grace might be <span class="accented">very</span> near to them - near to the most intimate and most controlling part of their nature.
