But the apostle professes his own faith, hope, and joy; and that his principal glory was in the cross of Christ. By which is here meant, his sufferings and death on the cross, the doctrine of salvation by a crucified Redeemer. By Christ, or by the cross of Christ, the world is crucified to the believer, and he to the world. The more we consider the sufferings of the Redeemer from the world, the less likely shall we be to love the world. The apostle was as little affected by its charms, as a beholder would be by any thing which had been graceful in the face of a crucified person, when he beholds it blackened in the agonies of death. He was no more affected by the objects around him, than one who is expiring would be struck with any of the prospects his dying eyes might view from the cross on which he hung. And as to those who have truly believed in Christ Jesus, all things are counted as utterly worthless compared with him. There is a new creation; old things are passed away, and new views and dispositions are brought in under the regenerating influences of God the Holy Spirit. Believers are brought into a new world, and being created in Christ Jesus unto good works, are formed to a life of holiness. It is a change of mind and heart, whereby we are enabled to believe in the Lord Jesus, and to live to God; and where this inward, practical religion is wanting, outward professions, or names, will never stand in any stead.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For in Christ Jesus - In his religion; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>.<p>But a new creature - The fact that a man is created anew, or born again, constitutes the real difference between him and other people.

Under the law, indeed, there was something in circumcision, as it was God’s covenant in the flesh to that people to whom he gave it, and the uncircumcised were strangers to the covenants of promise, and aliens to the church of God; but under the gospel, circumcision and uncircumcision are of no significancy; God neither regardeth any for the former, nor rejecteth any for the latter, he only looketh at the heart and inward man, whether that be renewed and sanctified, yea or no. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/galatians/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For in Christ Jesus,.... These words are omitted in the Syriac and Ethiopic versions; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-19.htm">1 Corinthians 7:19</a>, they contain a reason why the apostle gloried in a crucified Christ, and looked upon the world as dead to him, and he to that, in every state of it; particularly as it may design "the worldly sanctuary" of the Jews, and all the rites and ceremonies appertaining to it; and among the rest <p>circumcision, which availeth not anything; neither as a command, type, or privilege; or in the business of salvation, being abolished by Christ: <p>nor uncircumcision; being now no bar to the Gospel, Gospel ordinances, or a Gospel church state; or to any of the blessings of the everlasting covenant, which come upon the uncircumcision, as well as the circumcision. But to apply these words to baptism and non-baptism is a wretched perversion, and making a very ill use of them, whereby the minds of men are worked up to an indifference to a Christian institution; for though baptism is of no avail in the business of salvation, yet it cannot be said of it, as of circumcision, that it avails not anything as a command; for it is a standing ordinance of Christ; or as an emblem and sign, for it is significative of the death and burial, and resurrection of Christ; or as a privilege, for it is of use to lead the faith of God's people to his blood and righteousness for pardon and justification; for he that believes, and is baptized, shall be saved; and it is necessary to church communion: and, on the other hand, it cannot be said that non-baptism avails not; it is a bar to church fellowship; and a neglect of baptism in those who are the proper subjects of it, is resented by Christ, and is a rejecting of the counsel of God against themselves; which was the case of the Pharisees, in the time of John the Baptist: <p>but a new creature. The phrase is Rabbinical; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a> by which is meant, not a new creation of a man, as a man, of the members of his body, or of the faculties of his soul; nor of an external reformation, or a walking in newness of life, which is the fruit and effect of this new creation work; but an internal principle of grace, a good work of God begun in the soul, called the hidden man of the heart, the new man, Christ formed in us, of which faith that works by love is a part: this is called a "creature", and so not of man, but God; for none can create but himself; and in which work man is purely passive, as the heavens and the earth were in their creation: it is "but" a creature, and therefore needs divine support, fresh strength from God, and frequent supplies of grace to maintain and preserve it; nor is it to be trusted in, but the grace which is in Christ, from whence it comes, and by which it is secured. This is a "new" creature, in opposition to the old man; and because it is a principle in man, which never was there before; it consists of a new heart and spirit, of new eyes, ears, hands, and feet, expressive of new principles and actions, of new light, life, love, desires, joys, comforts, and duties: now this is of avail; it is a branch of the new covenant of grace, which God has therein promised to bestow on his people; it is an evidence of interest in Christ, the new and living way to the Father, and eternal life; such are newborn babes, regenerated persons, and have a right and meetness for the kingdom of God; shall possess the new Jerusalem, shall dwell in the new heavens and new earth; they are called by the Lord's new name, the adopted children of God; and have a new song put into their mouths, which none but redeemed and newborn souls can sing; and shall drink the new wine of endless joys and everlasting pleasures with Christ, in his Father's kingdom.

But by almost all recent editors this reading is replaced by the one given above. That <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the true reading, and not <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, all are agreed in thinking; <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> being regarded as a correction imported from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>. The evidence for the rejection of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, which is found in all the uncial manuscripts except the Vatican, is by no means equally decisive. The presence of those words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>, where they are very suitable to the context, has with great probability been supposed to explain their being also found here, being introduced, like <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> from the former passage, by the copyists; but here the qualification made by them is not so certainly required. The apostle felt it to be not merely true <span class="accented">relatively</span>, that is, for those "in Christ Jesus," but, since Christ died on a cross, true <span class="accented">absolutely</span>, that for salvation neither circumcision was aught, nor uncircumcision, but only a new creature. For the discussion of the terms of the aphorism as here stated, as compared with its form in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-19.htm">1 Corinthians 7:19</a>, the reader is referred to the notes on Galatians 5:6. The words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> may mean either "a new creature," or "a new act of creation making a man a new creature." It is hardly admissible to take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> as "creation" in a collective sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>; though this <span class="accented">may</span>, perhaps, be its meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, "If any man is in Christ, there is a new creation," that is (perhaps), he finds himself, as it were, in a new heaven and a new earth. Christians as such are elsewhere described by the apostle as the product of God's creative hand; thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, "For we are his workmanship (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), created (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) in Christ Jesus for good works." As "begotten again" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), or "born anew" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>), subjects of a "regeneration" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>), they must, of course, be the products of a new act of creation. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14-18</a> the sentence, "If any man is in Christ, there is a new creation," or "he is a new creature," lies embedded in a passage which describes in language of remarkable intenseness the transforming influence of Christ's death, wherever by faith it has been fully grasped. That passage, occurring as it does in an Epistle written nearly at the same time as the Epistle to the Galatians, leaves no doubt as to the ideas which in the apostle's mind cluster round the term" new creation," mentioned, here too as in effect there, in close connection with the cross of Christ, his sole supreme glory. It points to the state of a sinner consciously reconciled to God by the death of Christ, and finding himself thus translated into the midst of new perceptions, new joys, new habits of life. new expectations. "The old things are passed away" - guilt, the overmastering power of sin, laborious effort after goodness frustrated after all and ineffectual, the servile routine of a dead unquickening ceremonialism: "behold, all things are become new, and all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself through Christ." The phrase, "a new creature," appears to have been used by the Jews to describe the change resulting in the case of a heathen becoming a proselyte. <span class="accented">That</span> was no doubt a great change; but far greater seemed to the apostle to be the transformation in the case of one translated from the bondage and darkness of the "letter" into the "newness of the Spirit" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>). lie had himself experienced how marvellously great as well as how blessed the transition was; and he has described it in  glowing terms also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-2:10</a>. In the present passage the particle "for" seems to point back, not exclusively to ver. 14, but to the general tenor of the whole passage in vers. 12-14, as rebuking that great ado about circumcision which the innovators referred to were making in the Galatian Churches, thereby diverting the minds of those that listened to them from the Christian's true business. This sense of the particle may seem somewhat loose; but it suits well the rapid, decisive, summarizing strain with which the apostle is now closing up his letter. The supreme concern, he means, for every one who wishes to be a member of God's kingdom is that he shall realize in his own experience the "new creation;" alike in the freedom and joy of adoption which appertains thereto (ch. 4.), and also in that walking of the Spirit which includes the crucifixion of the flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>). On this point we may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-23.htm">Ephesians 4:23, 21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A new creature (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>.
