These Judaising teachers only wish to have you circumcised as a matter of outside show, in order to disguise their own professed Christianity from their fellow Jews, and so escape persecution. They show that they really care nothing for circumcision, for they freely break the rest of the Law to which they affect to give in their adhesion. Their true object is to make capital out of their influence over you, to boast publicly of your submission to the rite. I, too, will boast, but of something very different. My boast is in the cross of Christ. When I attached myself to the crucified Messiah, from that moment the world became nothing to me. Circumcision and uncircumcision matter not. The essential point is that total change which such a relation implies. On all who take this for their rule I can invoke a blessing, for they are the true Israel. Enough. I have a right to claim exemption from these attacks. The scars that I bear upon me are marks of the place I hold in my Master’s service.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Ye</span> <span class= "bld">see.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">See.</span> The Apostle calls the attention of his readers to the handwriting of these concluding paragraphs.<p><span class= "bld">How large a letter.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">in what large letters: i.e.,</span> characters. The exact significance of these words is somewhat enigmatic, and can only be matter of conjecture. Two points, however, are clear:—(1) The latter part of the Greek phrase means “in” or “with” letters—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> characters of hand-writing—and not “a letter,” “an epistle,” as it is taken in the Authorised version; (2) The former half of the phrase means “how large,” strictly in respect of size. The Apostle, for some reason or other, points out that the characters in which he is writing are larger than usual. What is his reason? It is hard to say. Some have thought that the reference was to the “shapelessness” of the letters, whether as due to the fact that the Apostle himself was not accustomed to the manual work of writing, or possibly to physical weakness from the hardships that he had undergone. The idea of “shapelessness,” however, is not necessarily included in that of size. It seems, on the whole, most probable that the size of the characters express the emphasis and authority with which the Apostle is writing. He adds to the Epistle—which had so far been written by an amanuensis—a few bold incisive strokes in his own hand, trenchantly exposing the motives of the Judaising faction, and re-asserting his own position.<p><span class= "bld">I have written.</span>—Must this be so taken: <span class= "ital">I have written?</span> or may it be idiomatically translated: <span class= "ital">I write?</span> In other words, does it refer to the whole previous portion of the Epistle, or only to these concluding paragraphs? The question turns upon a nice point of Greek scholarship, on which such authorities as Bishop Ellicott and Dr. Lightfoot take different sides. It will only be possible in a Commentary like this to express a general conclusion, without going into the arguments on which it is based. That conclusion would be that the Greek may, quite fairly and tenably, be translated: <span class= "ital">I write;</span> and that being so, considerations of exegesis would seem to tell somewhat decidedly in the same direction. The whole character of this concluding section is very much what we should expect if St. Paul followed his usual custom of taking the pen from the amanuensis to write it, and its brief weighty summarising style would correspond well with the “largo letters” in which he says that it was written. If this description is to be applied to the whole Epistle, it must remain a riddle to which there is no clue.<p><span class= "bld">With mine own hand.</span>—It was the Apostle’s custom to make use of an amanuensis, and only to add a few final words in proof of the genuineness of the writing. (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2Thessalonians 3:17</a>; and comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-21.htm" title="The salutation of me Paul with my own hand.">1Corinthians 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-18.htm" title=" The salutation by the hand of me Paul.

He generally wrote by an amanuensis. The original expression here used, <span class="greekheb">πηλικοις γραμμασιν</span>, which we render <span class="ital">how large a letter, </span>is, by Whitby, Doddridge, and some others, following Jerome, Chrysostom, and Theophylact, translated, <span class="ital">with what kind of, </span>or <span class="ital">with what large letters I have written unto you, </span>supposing it to be an apology for the in elegance of the writing. For from the apostle’s making use of an amanuensis in his other letters, they infer that he was not accustomed to write Greek. “The inference, however,” says Macknight, “does not follow. Eminent men, much engaged in affairs, commonly employ others to write for them, notwithstanding they are able to write very well themselves. I therefore prefer the translation in our Bibles, which represents the apostle as informing the Galatians that he wrote this large epistle with his own hand, to show how anxious he was to reclaim them from their errors, and to give them the fullest assurance of the truth of the doctrines contained in it; and that he uniformly preached the same doctrines everywhere.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:6-11 Many excuse themselves from the work of religion, though they may make a show, and profess it. They may impose upon others, yet they deceive themselves if they think to impose upon God, who knows their hearts as well as actions; and as he cannot be deceived, so he will not be mocked. Our present time is seed time; in the other world we shall reap as we sow now. As there are two sorts of sowing, one to the flesh, and the other to the Spirit, so will the reckoning be hereafter. Those who live a carnal, sensual life, must expect no other fruit from such a course than misery and ruin. But those who, under the guidance and influences of the Holy Spirit, live a life of faith in Christ, and abound in Christian graces, shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. We are all very apt to tire in duty, particularly in doing good. This we should carefully watch and guard against. Only to perseverance in well-doing is the reward promised. Here is an exhortation to all to do good in their places. We should take care to do good in our life-time, and make this the business of our lives. Especially when fresh occasions offer, and as far as our power reaches.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye see - This might be rendered see, in the imperative. So Tyndale renders it, "Behold." But it is more commonly supposed that it should be rendered in the indicative. The sense is not materially different whichever translation is adopted. The object of the apostle is, to direct their attention to the special proof of his love, which he had manifested in writing such a letter.<p>How large a letter - Considerable variety has existed in regard to the interpretation of this phrase. The word used here and translated "how large" (&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  pe&#772;likos), means. properly, "how great." Some have supposed that it refers to the size of the letters which Paul made in writing the Epistle - the length and crudeness of the characters which he used. Such interpreters suppose that he was not well versed in writing Greek, and that he used large letters. and those somewhat rudely made, like the Hebrew. So Doddridge and Whitby interpret it; and so Theodoret, Jerome, Theophylact, and some others. He might not, says Doddridge, have been well versed in the Greek characters; or "this inaccuracy of his writings might have been owing to the infirmity or weakness of his nerves, which he had hinted at before." Jerome says, that Paul was a Hebrew, and that he was unacquainted with the mode of writing Greek letters; and that because necessity demanded that he should write a letter in his own hand, contrary to his usual custom, he was obliged to form his characters in this crude manner. According to this interpretation, it was:<p>(1) A pledge to the Galatians that the Epistle was genuine, since it bore the marks of his own handwriting; and,<p>(2) It was proof of special affection for them that he was willing to undergo this labor on their account.<p>Others suppose that he means to refer to the size of the Epistle which he had written. Such is the interpretation of Grotius, Koppe, Bloomfield, Clarke, Locke, Chandler, and is, indeed, the common interpretation, as it is the obvious one. According to this, it was proof of special interest in them, and regard for them, that he had written to them a whole letter with his own hand. Usually he employed an amanuensis, and added his name, with a brief benediction or remark at the close; see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm">Romans 16:22</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-21.htm">1 Corinthians 16:21</a> note. What induced him to depart from his usual custom here is unknown. Jerome supposes that he refers here to what follows from this verse to the end of the Epistle, as that which he had written with his own hand, but the word &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;  egrapsa, says Rosenmuller, refers rather to what he had written, than to that which he intended to write. On this verse, the reader may consult with advantage, Tholuck on the Life and Writings of Paul: German Selections, by Edwards and Park, Andover, 1839, pp. 35, 64, 65. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Rather, "See in how large letters I have written." The Greek is translated "how great" in Heb 7:4, the only other passage where it occurs in the New Testament. Owing to his weakness of eyes (Ga 4:15) he wrote in large letters. So Jerome. All the oldest manuscripts are written in uncial, that is, capital letters, the "cursive," or small letters, being of more recent date. Paul seems to have had a difficulty in writing, which led him to make the uncial letters larger than ordinary writers did. The mention of these is as a token by which they would know that he wrote the whole Epistle with his own hand; as he did also the pastoral Epistle, which this Epistle resembles in style. He usually dictated his Epistles to an amanuensis, excepting the concluding salutation, which he wrote himself (Ro 16:22; 1Co 16:21). This letter, he tells the Galatians, he writes with his own hand, no doubt in order that they may see what a regard he had for them, in contrast to the Judaizing teachers (Ga 6:12), who sought only their own ease. If English Version be retained, the words, "how large a letter (literally, 'in how large letters')," will not refer to the length of the Epistle absolutely, but that it was a large one for him to have written with his own hand. Neander supports English Version, as more appropriate to the earnestness of the apostle and the tone of the Epistle: "How large" will thus be put for "how many."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/galatians/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Paul made use of the hands of others in the writing some others of the Epistles, as appears from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22</a></span>, and sometimes he himself only wrote the salutation, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-21.htm" title="The salutation of me Paul with my own hand.">1 Corinthians 16:21</a></span>: but he tells them he wrote this Epistle to them wholly with his own hand, that he might thereby more commend his love to them and care over them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/galatians/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye see how large a letter,.... Whether it be read as imperative, "see ye", observe, take notice; or as indicative, "ye see", ye do see, or you may see with your own eyes, it is of no great consequence: "how large a letter", or "with what letters"; which some understand of the largeness of the characters he wrote in; others of the deformity of them, he not writing a good hand, being an Hebrew, and not used to writing Greek; others of the grand and sublime matter which it contained; though neither of these seem to be the apostle's meaning; but he intends the length of the epistle, the prolixity of his writing; and which he mentions, as an instance and expression of his love to then, care of them, and concern for them: inasmuch as he took so much pains to write so long a letter to them, in order to set things right in their view, and recover them from error: not but that he had sent as long, or longer letters to other churches, as to the Romans, the Corinthians, and Hebrews: but then it is to be observed what follows, <p>I have written unto you with my own hand. The epistle to the Romans was written by Tertius, though dictated by the apostle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm">Romans 16:22</a> as very likely the others were by Timothy, or some other amanuensis. The apostle only put his name, and wrote his salutation, which was his token, in all his epistles, of the truth and genuineness of them; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a>, but this was not only dictated by him, but wrote with his hand, which very probably the Galatians knew; and since it was not usual for him to do so, it was the greater proof of his affection for them; that amidst so much work, and such labours as he was employed in, he should sit down and write so long an epistle to them with his own hand, in order to expose the errors of the false teachers, and reclaim them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</span><p>(9) The fourth and last part of the epistle, in which he returns to his principal end and purpose: that is, that the Galatians should not allow themselves to be led out of the way by the false apostles.

The native of Tarsus and Roman citizen, who from his youth had enjoyed a learned training in Jerusalem, where the Greek language was very current among the Jews (see Hug, <span class="ital">Einl</span>. II. § 10)—the man who handled with so much delicacy and skill the Greek literary language, who was familiar with the works of the Greek poets (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm" title="For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.">Acts 17:28</a>), and who was in constant intercourse with Greek Jews and Gentiles,—is it to be thought that such an one should not have possessed even the humble attainment of writing Greek without making the letters of an unshapely size? In Wieseler’s view, the <span class="ital">large</span> letters were very <span class="ital">legible</span> (for the public reading of the epistle); and in calling attention to this circumstance, Paul desires to bring into prominence his great love for his readers, which shuns no trouble on their account. But even thus the matter would amount only to a trifle. The Galatians were in possession of far greater proofs of his love than the size of the characters in his own handwriting, which, besides, might be something very different from legibility.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[259] 1 From <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a> it is to be assumed that Paul closed <span class="ital">all</span> his epistles with his own hand, even when he does not expressly <span class="ital">say so</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[260] The principal emphasis is on the word <span class="greekheb">πηλίκοις</span>, which is therefore placed apart; the secondary stress lies on <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἐμῇ χειρί</span>. It may, however, be doubtful whether Paul wrote <span class="ital">merely</span> ver. 12 with larger letters, and the sequel with his own hand but in his ordinary mode of writing, <span class="ital">or</span> whether he continued the large characters down to ver. 16 <span class="ital">or</span> to ver. 18. The internal connection of vv. 12–16, the uniform solemn tone of these verses down to their solemn conclusion, and the abrupt character of ver. 17, all unite in inducing us to adopt the <span class="ital">second</span> view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[261] In adopting this view various grounds have been guessed for its autograph composition. Pelagius: “that Paul desired to show that <span class="ital">he was not afraid!</span>” Ambrosiaster, comp. Augustine and Michaelis: “that he desired to prove the <span class="ital">genuineness of the epistle</span>.” Chrysostom (who, moreover, assumes in addition the cause assigned by Pelagius), Luther, Calvin, Calovius, and many others: “that his intention was to show the Galatians his <span class="ital">earnest care</span> for them, to make them attentive in reading, and the like.” Hilgenfeld: “that he <span class="ital">attached so much importance</span> to the epistle.” Ewald: “that <span class="ital">Timothy had not been with him just</span> at the time when he composed the epistle; and he thus wished, in the postscript written at a somewhat later period, to make excuse for the large inelegant letters in which the epistle had been written.” Hofmann: “that the autograph writing was intended <span class="ital">to bring the apostle as it were vividly before the eyes of his readers</span>.” Hofmann is also of opinion that Paul had not elsewhere written with his own hand, that he might not needlessly curtail the time for procuring his bodily maintenance. As if the <span class="ital">dictating</span> to the pen of another would not have involved just as much loss of time! Tertius and Timothy were hardly shorthand writers. Or is Paul supposed to have been occupied in tent-making <span class="ital">during the time when</span> he was dictating his letters, which presuppose so much abstraction and concentration of mental labour?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[262] This is not, as is often stated, the view of Jerome, who, on the contrary, specifies this view only to reject it, and assumes that down to ver. 11 the epistle was written by the amanuensis, but after ver. 11 by Paul himself in very large characters, in order that his readers should recognise his genuine handwriting and at the same time his solicitous care for them. Jerome therefore comes nearest to our view, but introduces into the <span class="greekheb">πηλίκοις</span> purposes which have no natural connection with the largeness of the characters, and could not, without further intimation, have been understood by the reader. Theodore of Mopsuestia explains it better, likewise understanding <span class="greekheb">πηλίκοις γράμμασιν</span> correctly (<span class="greekheb">μείζοσιν ἐχρήσατο γράμμασιν</span>), and specifying as Paul’s object that he, <span class="greekheb">μέλλων καθάπτεσθαι τῶν ἐναντίων</span>, wished to intimate that he neither <span class="greekheb">ἐρυθριᾷ οὔτε ἀρνεῖται τὰ λεγόμενα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[263] Taking the word by itself, there can be no doubt that <span class="greekheb">γράμμα</span> (<span class="ital">scriptum</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm" title="And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 3:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-47.htm" title="But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?">John 5:47</a>) may, according to the context, mean <span class="ital">epistle</span>, so that in the plural it would denote <span class="ital">epistolae</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-21.htm" title="And they said to him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning you, neither any of the brothers that came showed or spoke any harm of you.">Acts 28:21</a>, and often in Greek authors), but may also apply to a <span class="ital">single</span> epistle. Thus, for instance, Thuc. vii. 8. 3, where <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστολή</span> is used shortly before; Xen. <span class="ital">Cyr</span>. iv. 5. 26, where <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστολή</span> occurs immediately after; Xen. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a></span> and Locella <span class="ital">in loc</span>.

Many ancient and most modern expositors take this to refer not to the length of the Epistle—which is certainly not ‘large’ as compared with those to the Romans and Corinthians—but to the nature of the characters employed. It is curious that the exact meaning of this word rendered ‘how large’ should have been so far overlooked as to suggest the explanation, ‘in how rude characters,’ as though the Apostle called attention to his want of skill in writing Greek. This view might have been left unnoticed, but for the distinguished name of Chrysostom, who among others maintains it. A second explanation supposes that St Paul, in calling attention to the large characters which he used, intended to hint at the cause, either general bodily ill-health, or local infirmity, such as weak eyesight. If this latter suggestion be adopted, it will confirm the hypothesis mentioned in the note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm" title="You know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel to you at the first.">Galatians 4:13</a>. But it is on the whole more probable that the largeness of the letters was intended to express the importance of the message to be conveyed. To those who have studied carefully the character of the great Apostle this view, suggested by the ablest of his early commentators and adopted by the greatest of modern expositors of his Epistles, will commend itself as in keeping with what we know of the man, and as congruous with any just estimate of the scope of the Epistle itself. In the verses which follow St Paul sums up the whole argument of the Epistle, a weighty argument on a cardinal doctrine, gathered up in a summary, weighty and powerful, and emphasised by the very characters in which it was written, ‘Golden words, proportionately transcribed.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But do the words, ‘See in what large letters I write unto you with mine own hand,’ apply to the whole Epistle, or only to this concluding paragraph? It may be admitted that so far as the words employed in this verse are concerned, either alternative may be adopted. Alford is of opinion that ‘on account of the peculiar character of this Epistle, St Paul wrote it all with his own hand,—as he did the Pastoral Epistles,’ and he finds ‘confirmation of this, in the partial resemblance of its style to those Epistles.’ Others with more probability regard the Apostle as having employed an amanuensis thus far, and at this verse to have taken the pen into his own hand. The reasons assigned for this conclusion are drawn from what we know of his practice in other Epistles. It seems from an expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>, where he cautions his converts against being unsettled ‘by epistle as from us,’ that letters had been forged purporting to have been written by him—such forgeries were not uncommon in the subsequent history of the early Church—and as a mark of genuineness he adopted the practice of adding at the end of his Epistles a few lines in his own hand, the rest having been written by Tertius, or some other amanuensis. Thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2 Thessalonians 3:17</a>, ‘The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every Epistle: so I write.

Also the former is compared to hortatory, the latter to polemic theology.[63] He had not heretofore written a longer epistle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[63] And as compared respectively with their subjects, the Epistle to the Hebrews was short, that to the Galatians long.—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>); <span class="accented">see with what large pieces of writing</span> (or, <span class="accented">with what large letters</span>) <span class="accented">I have written</span> (or, <span class="accented">I write</span>) <span class="accented">unto you with mine own hand.</span> There can be hardly any doubt that the rendering "ye see" of the Authorized Version, supposing, as it seems to do, that this is meant as an indicative, must be wrong (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-29.htm">John 4:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>).

What appears to the present writer the most probable view he must explain as  briefly as he is able. The interrogative <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means "how great," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-2.htm">Zechariah 2:2</a> (Septuagint); <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-4.htm">Hebrews 7:4</a>. Accordingly, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> in Polyb., 1:2, 8 (cited in Liddell and Scott's 'Lexicon') means "how many and how large." Many, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Chrysostom, have supposed that the word includes a reference to clumsiness, ungainliness, as attaching to the apostle's handwriting ("with what big letters!'). But no example of the word being used in this sense of "ungainliness" has been adduced; and it seems safer not to import into its rendering this additional shade of meaning. The dative <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> Bishop Lightfoot proposes to connect closely with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> are often used in familiar style, with the sense <span class="accented">mark you</span>! But there is no instance of this use of the dative pronoun in the Greek Testament (see Winer, 'Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 22, 7, Anna. 2, p. 140); and here surely it more naturally connects itself with <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span>. It is not uncommon with St. Paul to insert some word or words between a substantive and its adjective or dependent genitive, as here between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15</a>, etc.). In the instances now cited there appears no more logical occasion for such a seeming disarrangement of the words than there does here. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> is used with no objective accusative following, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>; the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> being in the dative, because the apostle is referring merely to the <span class="accented">form</span> of the medium of communication, and not to the substance of the communication itself. The rendering of the Authorized Version, "how large a letter I have written," cannot be defended as a literal translation, though it may be allowed on one view of the passage to give the sense rightly. But though the plural noun <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, in ordinary Greek, like <span class="accented">literae</span> in Latin, sometimes occurs in the sense of a single epistle or letter, it is never so used by St. Paul, who always employs the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> to express this notion, which he does no less than seventeen times. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-21.htm">Acts 28:21</a> it is rendered "letters," in the plural number; being properly "communications in writing." The noun <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> was the word ordinarily employed in Greek to designate a letter of the alphabet. It also denotes "a writing," as when in the plural we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-47.htm">John 5:47</a>, "if ye believe not his writings," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>," the sacred writings," or Scriptures. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-6.htm">Luke 16:6, 7</a> "take thy bill" is literally, "take thy writings" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> being the now accepted reading in the Greek text). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>, "the ministration of death in writings," the word probably refers to the ten commandments, each forming one writing; though it <span class="accented">may</span> mean "in characters of writing." In ordinary Greek it sometimes denotes a passage of a treatise or book (Liddell and Scott, under the word, 2:4). Next <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> ("I have written") may be understood, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>, "I have written the more boldly unto you," etc., with reference to the entire letter, now nearly complete, as it lies before him. In that case the apostle's words may be rendered, "See, with what long writings [or, 'pieces of writing'] I have written unto you with mine own hand." Through some cause or other, we know not what the cause was, writing with his own hand was not a welcome employment to him; so far unwelcome that he generally devolved the actual penning of his letters upon an amanuensis, merely authenticating each letter as his own by a postscript added in his own hand (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3</a>. <span class="accented">fin</span>.). Perhaps Philemon forms the only' exception (see ver. 19), apart from this letter to the Galatians. We may, therefore, imagine the apostle as painfully and laboriously penning one portion after another of the Epistle; often pausing weariedly in the work as he came to the end of each <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, that is, to the end of each section of his argument, each seeming to him a long and toilsome effort. And now at last he exclaims," Look, what long, laborious performances of handwriting I have achieved in writing to you! And from that learn how deeply I am concerned on your behalf, and how grave your present spiritual peril appears to me to be!" Ordinarily it was only a brief "piece of writing" that he wrote with his own hand; here, long pieces, added one after another with painful effort. Or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the verb "I have written" may be referred to what the apostle is now beginning to pen, not merely because the epistolary style of the ancients, Greek and Roman, was wont to place the writer of a letter in the temporal standing-point of its recipient, as when Cicero dates his letters <span class="accented">scribebam Id</span>., etc., but because under some circumstances it is natural that the writer should thus refer himself to the view of his correspondent. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-19.htm">Philemon 1:19</a>, "I Paul have written it (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>) with mine own hand, I will repay it." It would be quite obvious to ourselves to express our meaning in the same manner. So far, then, as such considerations reach, it appears quite supposable that the apostle, having employed an amanuensis as usual as far as the end of ver. 10, then himself took up the pen for the customary addition of an authenticating postscript; and that, for the purpose of adding especial emphasis to the postscript which he here thought advisable to add, he made his handwriting most unusually large, and that it is to this emphatic style  of penmanship that he here draws attention. Many modern critics have acquiesced in this explanation; and if <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "<span class="accented">letters</span>," that is, characters of the writing, it seems the most probable; for it does not seem likely that the whole Epistle was written in letters of an extraordinary size; while, if the characters were those of his ordinary style of penmanship, the remark would be too trivial to come from him. The present writer inclines to the former method of interpretation. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>How large a letter (&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>More correctly, with how large letters. &#x393;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; may mean an epistle, as Lat. literae, or epistles; but Paul habitually uses &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; for an epistle. &#x393;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; means with characters, and &#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; refers to their size. It is claimed by some that the large characters are intended to call the attention of the readers to the special importance of the close of the letter. See below.<p>I have written (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;)<p>The aorist may refer to the whole of the preceding letter, or to the concluding verses which follow. In either case it is probably an instance of the epistolary aorist, by which the writer puts himself at the time when his correspondent is reading his letter. To the correspondent, I write has changed itself into I wrote. Similarly the Lat. scripsi. &#x395;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1; I sent is used in the same way. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-30.htm">Acts 23:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-28.htm">Philippians 2:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-8.htm">Colossians 4:8</a>; Plm 1:11.<p>With mine own hand (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;)<p>The aorist &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1; is epistolary, and refers to what follows. The concluding verses emphasize the main issue of the letter, that the Judaising intruders are trying to win the Galatians over to the economy of circumcision which is opposed to the economy of the cross. It is therefore quite probable that Paul may have wished to call special attention to these verses. If so, this special call lies in the words with my own hand, and not in with how large letters, which would seem to have been added to call attention to the apostle's handwriting as distinguished from that of the amanuensis. "Mark carefully these closing words of mine. I write them with my own hand in the large characters which you know." </body></html>
