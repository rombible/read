In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-19.htm" title="Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.">Acts 19:19</a> we read that at Ephesus, “many of them which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men;” and there is other evidence to the same effect.<p><span class= "bld">Variance.</span>—<span class= "ital">Strife,</span> or <span class= "ital">contention.</span><p><span class= "bld">Emulations.</span>—Singular and plural are somewhat strangely mixed throughout the list. There is a division of authorities as to the reading in the case <span class= "ital">of</span> this word. It seems probable, upon the whole, that the singular is right—<span class= "ital">emulation,</span> or <span class= "ital">jealousy.</span> “Wrath,” on the other hand, should be <span class= "ital">wraths</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> ebullitions or outbreaks of wrath. (See the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Strife.</span>—This appears to be a mistake in the Authorised version. The word was supposed to be connected with that translated “variance” above, and the two words received the same translation indifferently. The word <span class= "ital">ereis,</span> which is here translated “variance,” is rendered by “strife” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?">1Corinthians 3:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:">Philippians 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-4.htm" title="He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,">1Timothy 6:4</a>; on the other hand, the word <span class= "ital">eritheia</span> is rendered by “strife” here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2Corinthians 12:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm" title="Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.">Philippians 2:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/3-14.htm" title="But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.">James 3:14-16</a>. It is rendered by “contention” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm" title="But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,">Romans 2:8</a> (“them that are contentious”) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-16.htm" title="The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:">Philippians 1:16</a>. The true derivation of this latter word is, however, something quite different: it is to be sought in a word meaning “a day-labourer.” Hence we get the senses—(1) labour for hire; (2) interested canvassing for office; (3) a spirit of factious partisanship; factiousness. (This word, too, is really in the plural.)<p><span class= "bld">Seditions, heresies.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">divisions, parties.</span> The Authorised version has too special and technical a sound, as if the first related to factions in the State, and the second in the Church. This is not really so. The two words are distinguished from each other, as the lighter and more aggravated forms of division: the first. divisions; the second, divisions organised into parties.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:16-26 If it be our care to act under the guidance and power of the blessed Spirit, though we may not be freed from the stirrings and oppositions of the corrupt nature which remains in us, it shall not have dominion over us. Believers are engaged in a conflict, in which they earnestly desire that grace may obtain full and speedy victory. And those who desire thus to give themselves up to be led by the Holy Spirit, are not under the law as a covenant of works, nor exposed to its awful curse. Their hatred of sin, and desires after holiness, show that they have a part in the salvation of the gospel. The works of the flesh are many and manifest. And these sins will shut men out of heaven. Yet what numbers, calling themselves Christians, live in these, and say they hope for heaven! The fruits of the Spirit, or of the renewed nature, which we are to do, are named. And as the apostle had chiefly named works of the flesh, not only hurtful to men themselves, but tending to make them so to one another, so here he chiefly notices the fruits of the Spirit, which tend to make Christians agreeable one to another, as well as to make them happy. The fruits of the Spirit plainly show, that such are led by the Spirit. By describing the works of the flesh and fruits of the Spirit, we are told what to avoid and oppose, and what we are to cherish and cultivate; and this is the sincere care and endeavour of all real Christians. Sin does not now reign in their mortal bodies, so that they obey it, Ro 6:12, for they seek to destroy it. Christ never will own those who yield themselves up to be the servants of sin. And it is not enough that we cease to do evil, but we must learn to do well. Our conversation will always be answerable to the principle which guides and governs us, Ro 8:5. We must set ourselves in earnest to mortify the deeds of the body, and to walk in newness of life. Not being desirous of vain-glory, or unduly wishing for the esteem and applause of men, not provoking or envying one another, but seeking to bring forth more abundantly those good fruits, which are, through Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Witchcraft - Pretending to witchcraft. The apostle does not vouch for the actual existence of witchcraft; but he says that what was known as such was a proof of the corrupt nature of man, and was one of the fruits of it. No one can doubt it. It was a system of imposture and falsehood throughout; and nothing is a better demonstration of the depravity of the human heart than an extended and systematized attempt to impose on mankind. The word which is used here (&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  pharmakeia, whence our word "pharmacy," from &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  pharmakon, a medicine, poison, magic potion) means, properly, the preparing and giving of medicine. Then it means also poisoning, and also magic art, or enchantment; because in savage nations pharmacy or medicine consisted much in magical incantations. Thence it means sorcery or enchantment, and it is so used uniformly in the New Testament. It is used only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-23.htm">Revelation 18:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>. Some have supposed that it means poisoning here, a crime often practiced; but the more correct interpretation is, to refer it to the black art, or to pretensions to witchcraft, and the numerous delusions which have grown out of it, as a striking illustration of the corrupt and depraved nature of man.<p>Hatred - Greek: "hatreds," in the plural. Antipathies, and lack of love, producing contentions and strifes.<p>Variance - Contentions; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>.<p>Emulations - (&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  ze&#772;loi). In a bad sense, meaning heart-burning, or jealousy, or perhaps inordinate ambition. The sense is ardor or zeal in a bad cause, leading to strife, etc.<p>Wrath - This also is plural in the Greek (&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768;  thumoi), meaning passions, "bursts of anger;" see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>.<p>Strife - Also plural in the Greek; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a><p>Seditions - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>.<p>Heresies - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. witchcraft&#8212;sorcery; prevalent in Asia (Ac 19:19; compare Re 21).<p>hatred&#8212;Greek, "hatreds."<p>variance&#8212;Greek, "strife"; singular in the oldest manuscripts.<p>emulations&#8212;in the oldest manuscripts, singular&#8212;"emulation," or rather, "jealousy"; for the sake of one's own advantage.

The apparent derivation of this word from <span class="greekheb">ἔριθος</span> (<span class="ital">a hireling</span>) points to mercenary motives. The Apostle elsewhere associates it with jealousy, envy and vainglory, and contrasts it with sincerity, union and love. It denotes, probably, selfish intrigues.—<span class="greekheb">αἱρέσεις</span>.

The second class of sins are those which concern religion—idolatry and sorcery, or witchcraft. The word ‘idolatry’ is probably to be understood here in its literal sense, the worship of false deities, and not in the metaphorical and wider sense in which it is employed by St Paul, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>, a passage which is, however, strikingly parallel to this. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm" title=" Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:">Colossians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-11.htm" title="But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortionist; with such an one no not to eat.">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>. The connexion with ‘sorceries’, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm" title="But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.">Revelation 21:8</a>, seems to limit the meaning to the superstitious worship of the heathen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word rendered ‘witchcraft’ originally meant ‘the use of drugs’, then, in a bad sense, ‘poisoning’. Those who ‘used curious arts’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-19.htm" title="Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.">Acts 19:19</a>) combined demonology or witchcraft with the use of drugs as philtres, &c. For an illustration of this compare the well-known 5th Epode of Horace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The next eight ‘works of the flesh’ are those which are <span class="ital">directly</span> opposed to love of our neighbour or Christian charity. Translate, ‘enmities, strife, rivalry, angers, factions, divisions, sects, envyings’. The first four of these are enumerated in the same order, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">heresies</span>] Rendered rightly ‘sects’ by Wiclif, Tyndale, and Cranmer, and also in the Rhemish N. T. The Vulgate has ‘sectæ’. It means the formation of ‘distinct and organized parties’—a further development of ‘divisions’; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.">1 Corinthians 11:18</a>. It is applied to the Sadducees, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm" title="Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,">Acts 5:17</a>; to the Pharisees, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm" title="But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.">Acts 15:5</a>; to the Nazarenes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm" title="For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:">Acts 24:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">murders</span>] Possibly this should be omitted with R.V. There is an alliteration between the Greek words rendered ‘envyings, murders’, which is lost in a translation. They occur together <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm" title="Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,">Romans 1:29</a>. See the reference to Jerome in note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,...">Galatians 5:19-21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">drunkenness, revellings</span>] Probably no better rendering can be found for the latter of these words. In Classical Greek it is used of those nightly revellings in which the wealthier young men indulged, when after an evening spent in debauchery they disturbed the quiet of the streets by ribald songs and noisy violence. Readers of the <span class="ital">Spectator</span> will remember that such ‘revellings’ were common enough in London at the beginning of the last century to provoke the rebuke of the moralist: <span class="ital">Spectator</span>, No. 324; Macaulay, <span class="ital">Hist</span>. c. 111. p. 360. Drunkenness may be secret, or it may result in orgies or riot. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-18.htm" title="And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;">Ephesians 5:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and such like</span>] = ‘such things’ in the following clause. The catalogue, terribly large as it is, does not specify every form of working under which the flesh manifests itself. ‘Man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the Spirit’. Art. ix.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I tell you before … in time past</span>] <span class="bld">In respect of which I forewarn you, even as I forewarned you</span>, when I was present with you.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they which do</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">who practise</span>. Exclusion from the Kingdom of Heaven is denounced not against all who have at any time committed any of these sins (for who then can be saved?) but against all who remain impenitent, and who do not ‘through the Spirit mortify the deeds of the body’. In two other Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,...">1 Corinthians 6:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>), St Paul uses nearly the same terms as to the sins which <span class="ital">disinherit</span> a man from ‘the Kingdom of God’. The Kingdom is not the visible Church, in which the tares and the wheat grow together: neither is it the Gospel dispensation—a sense in which it is sometimes used, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-2.htm" title="And saying, Repent you: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.">Matthew 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-28.htm" title="For I say to you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.">Luke 7:28</a>—but that Kingdom for whose Advent we pray in the Lord’s Prayer, which has been the hope of loyal hearts from early days, the theme of Psalmist and Prophet, the vision of the beloved disciple in Patmos—not heaven, though ‘<span class="ital">of</span> heaven’, not earth, though ‘on the earth’—the Kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world for the beloved of the Father, the adopted ‘sons and daughters of the Lord Almighty’.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/galatians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm" title="Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,">Galatians 5:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Φαρμακεία</span>) See LXX., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm" title="Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.">Exodus 7:11</a>, and in many other passages.

We may compare, "in respect to the former, the temptations which the apostle recognizes the danger of in the case of the Corinthians (1 Corinthians rift. and 10.). "Sorcery." The word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, originally denoting the use of drugs merely, means, sometimes, their use for poisoning; but this sense would not be very suitable here. But the nouns <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, like <span class="accented">veneficus</span> and <span class="accented">veneficium</span> in Latin, are also often used with reference to the employment of drugs in charms and incantations; and thence of the employment of black arts in general - magic, sorcery, witchcraft; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-21.htm">Revelation 9:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>; where the Authorized Version gives "sorceries," "sorcerers;" and in the Septuagint, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-18.htm">Exodus 8:18</a> (Authorized Version, "magicians" ); <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9, 12</a> ("enchantments" ).

The claim to the possession of <span class="accented">such</span> powers, common at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-13.htm">2 Timothy 3:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), and rife, perhaps, universally among heathens, certainly so in the Roman empire round the Mediterranean, had no doubt been a snare also to the Galatians. Bishop Lightfoot adverts to a very stringent canon of the Council of Ancyra (the capital of Galatia), A.D. 314, condemning <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It may be doubted whether the apostle himself would regard, or had reason to regard, pretensions to such supernatural arts as merely delusive or superstitious. Experiences such as that recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16-18</a>, would hardly permit him to do so<span class="cmt_word">. Hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditious, heresies</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>], <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">enmities</span>, <span class="accented">strife</span>, <span class="accented">jealousies</span>, <span class="accented">wraths</span>, <span class="accented">factions</span>, <span class="accented">divisions</span>, <span class="accented">heresies</span> (or, <span class="accented">parties</span>). This third group, to which belongs also the <span class="accented">envyings</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), together with the probably not genuine <span class="accented">murders</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) of the next verse, is bound together by the common characteristic of malignity. This vice of our nature, so inveterate in our fallen state - the antithesis to the love which  is the essence of goodness - is, strangely enough as it at first sight seems, most readily stimulated into rancour by differences in religion. As at this very same time at Corinth, so here in Galatia likewise, the "flesh" displayed its malignity in "jealousy, strife, and divisions (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)," originating from this cause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>). "Emnities;" manifestations of aversion openly displaying itself. "Strife;" the outward mutual conflict of persons animated with such sentiments. The plural number of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, strifes, given by the Textus Receptus, as well as, perhaps, the plural of <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, jealousies, which not improbably should also be read in the singular, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, jealousy, may have owed its introduction by the copyists to the plural number of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which is not questioned. The precise import of <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, rendered "jealousy," is not easily determined. It is spoken of as a virtue in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>, "the zeal of thine house;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>, "zeal for God;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6</a>, "touching zeal, persecuting the Church;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>, "your fervent mind [or, 'your zeal'] for me;" ibid., ver. 11, "what zeal" But in perhaps all these cases, the ardent favouring of what is good is thought of as either ready to take, or actually taking, the aspect of <span class="accented">boiling</span> resentment against its assailants; thus also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a> ("fiery indignation," Authorized Version), literally, "zeal of fire." So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>, "zealous;" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "jealous God" (Authorized Version); Hebrews <span class="accented">el qanna</span> To this line of meaning is to be referred <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>, "filled with indignation (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." In another class of passages the word denotes a wrong state of feeling, where in the Authorized Version it is uniformly rendered "envy" or "envying.' ' These are <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a> (Revised Version, "jealousy" ), where it surely means the resentment which the Jews felt at the supposed invasion of their own theocratic prerogatives. In the remaining passages of the New Testament in which it occurs it is linked either with "strife," as it is here; namely, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; or with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14, 16</a>. In these passages there does not seem any reason on the face of them for supposing that it means "envy," that is, grudging to another some advantage; this in Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. A more probable view is that <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> denotes eagerness to find in another some ground for hot resentment against him. Perhaps we have no single equivalent word in our language, "jealousy" being the nearest approach. In the Epistle of Clement of Rome to the Corinthians, ch. 4-6, we have a long list of instances given of persons who have suffered through being objects of <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: in many of them "envy," or "rivalry," would seem to be the more prominent notion in the word; but in others it appears to mean rather "jealousy;" in some the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a> or Acts 13:45. The next word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, wraths, denotes violent ebullitions of passionate anger; the plural pointing to different occasions prompting such. The following term, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (rendered "factious" ), was formerly imagined to be etymologically connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, strife - a notion which is now generally abandoned. The verb from which it is derived, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, is to act the part of an <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, day-labourer, the noun signifying "labour for hire;" then, scheming or intriguing for a post of employment; and next, "party-action," "the contentious spirit of faction., In the New Testament it occurs six times besides here. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (Authorized Version, "them who are contentious" ), it appears to denote those who set themselves in factious opposition to the truth, the apostle having no doubt especially in his eye Jewish gainsayers of the gospel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-16.htm">Philippians 1:16</a>, "some preach Christ <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>," it points to factious opposition to Christ's divinely appointed heralds. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>, "let nothing be done <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>," the same sense of factious opposition to others is quite suitable. In the remaining passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, come together as they do here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14-16</a>, where, as above noted, it is coujoined with <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the notion of "factiousness," or "faction," perfectly satisfies the context. In the present passage the plural, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, denotes factious feelings roused on behalf of this cause and that; such sentiments as are likely to eventuate in <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, divisions, that is, more distinctly formed parties "standing apart" from each other; whilst these again culminate in <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>, where they are spoken of as indicative of <span class="accented">a fleshly</span> mind. and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>, "Mark them which cause divisions and (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) occasions of stumbling." We may regard this word as standing in the same relation to <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> as the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "<span class="accented">divisions</span>," or "schisms," do which are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-18.htm">1 Corinthians 11:18</a>," When ye come together in the Church, I hear that <span class="accented">divisions</span> exist among you; and I partly believe it; for there must be also <span class="accented">heresies</span> among you." In endeavouring to ascertain the exact import of this last word (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), "heresies," we must first ascertain the sense in which <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> was currently used before it was employed to describe phenomena appearing in the Church. The proper sense of "<span class="accented">choice"</span> was in this word often limited to the specific sense of "<span class="accented">choice</span> of views," particularly in philosophy or religion; that is, it meant "ways of thinking;" and then,  by an easy transition, "those who followed a particular way of thinking"- "a school of thought." Thus it occurs in Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 'De Dora. et Arist.,' 7, etc. (see Liddell and Scott). This sense was so current in Dionysius's time as to appear in Latin in the contemporary writings of Cicero; thus, in 'Protein. Parad.,' Cicero writes, "Care in ea est haeresi [sc. the Stoic], quae nullum sequitur florem orationis;" 'Ad Famil.,' 15:16; 'Ad Att.,' 14:14. Similarly Vitruvius writes, 'Prier.,' 5, "Pythagorae haeresin sequi." It is not always easy to discriminate whether the "school of thought" so designated means the way of thinking itself or the set of men who held it. In this sense the word is used in the New Testament. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>, "the high priest and all they that were with him, which is the <span class="accented">heresy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) of the Sadducees;" where it means the sect, and not their views. So again, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>, "certain of those of the <span class="accented">heresy</span> of the Pharisees;" ibid., 24.5, "ringleader of the <span class="accented">heresy</span> of the Nazaraeans," where Tertullus plainly meant those who held the views of the Nazaraeans, and not the views themselves. But, on the other hand, in the same chapter St. Paul in his reply (ver. 14), when he says, "After the way which they call a <span class="accented">heresy</span>, so serve I the God of our fathers," evidently uses the term as applying to "the Way" itself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>), and not to the people who followed it. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a>, "after the straitest <span class="accented">heresy</span> of our religion (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) I lived a Pharisee," the word may be taken either way. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm">Acts 28:22</a>. "concerning this <span class="accented">heresy</span>, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against," it seems, of the two, to be rather the more obvious way to take it of "what Paul thought," than of the persons so thinking. If, however, it be taken of persons, it is of course to be taken of them as holding and representing such views. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, "false teachers, who shall privily bring in <span class="accented">heresies</span> of perdition," the qualifying genitive, "of perdition," would seem to favour our understanding the "heresies" of the doctrines of these false teachers, rather than of the parties following their teaching. On the whole review of these passages, it is of the utmost importance to note the manner in which, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>, etc., St. Paul treats Tertullus's application of the term to the Christian faith. "I confess," he says, "that after the way which they call <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the Law, and which are written in the prophets: having hope towards God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection, both of the just and unjust." In thus speaking, the apostle repudiates the application of the term <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> to the Christian faith; not, however, on the ground that the term denoted a flagrantly erroneous and vicious form of doctrine; for there is nothing to show that this was the idea which Tertullus meant to convey to Felix's mind, in so designating either Christians or their faith: what, indeed, should Felix care about the soundness or unsoundness of their doctrines? The apostle rather repudiates the term, because, as signifying" choice," it implied that the views referred to were adopted on the prompting of individual opinion or liking. That it was not this, he shows by referring partly to the broad basis of Divine revelation in general as propounding the doctrine of the resurrection, which lay at the foundation of the Christian faith; and partly to the fact that his accusers themselves admitted that doctrine. Christians believed that Jesus was raised from the dead, not because they "chose" to think so, but because God's Word taught them so to believe. We are thus landed at the conclusion that, antecedently to its introduction into the language of the Church, the term <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> denoted a school of thought or a set of opinions; sometimes the opinions them-solves; sometimes the people holding them; but that it was understood to do so with reference to points on which there did not appear to be any decisive authority to determine men's convictions, and respecting which, therefore, men might <span class="accented">choose</span> their own opinions as they thought themselves best able, This conclusion will help us to understand its import in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>, in the passage before us, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, as well as the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10, 11</a>, in which the case of "a man that is an heretic (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>)" is dealt with. It is clear, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>, that the apostle regarded the "gospel" which had been delivered to the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>) by himself and his fellow-apostles, as being a revelation so certain and authoritative that any teacher introducing doctrine seriously infringing upon its substantial import would subject himself to the extreme malediction of God. The whole tenor of this Epistle shows that its author considered the Churches of Galatia as at this very time in danger of either producing from their own bosom, or else admitting from the teaching of others, doctrine which would be thus fatally subversive of the truth. Was it not, then, extremely probable that, when here enumerating, with an especial eye to the case of the Churches he was addressing, "the works of the flesh," which would cut off those who gave themselves up to their practice from the inheritance of the kingdom of God, he would specify this particular "work" of propounding, or embracing when propounded by  others, doctrine which should vitally deprave the truth which God had revealed? Any doctrine which thus tampered with the gospel would, of course, be a <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - views of men's own devising and "choosing." The term, as has been seen, might also describe a body of adherents to such false doctrine. But in the passage before <span class="accented">us</span>, in which the works of the flesh are recited, and not the doers of such works, the term must describe, not persons, but acts - acts, that is, of conceiving or propounding in the Church views subversive of the gospel, and gathering adherents to such views; such adherents would, among Christians, form a <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> antagonistic to the doctrine of Christ received in the Church. "Caballings" and "divisions,' ' <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, might arise among Christians who still held fast to the substance of the gospel; fatal to the spiritual life, it might be, of those indulging in them; but yet essentially different from "heresies," because not involving departure from the faith once for all delivered to the saints, or conscious rebellion against the accredited organ d. It is of prime importance in estimating the nature of this "work of the flesh," with a practical view to our present circumstances, that we bear in mind this feature of it - that it is a relinquishment, a conscious relinquishment of the teaching of Christ, a breaking off from "the Head." The above view is precisely that given by Tertullian, ' De Prsescriptionibus Haereticorum,' 6. Bishop Lightfoot, in his Introduction to his Commentary on this Epistle, pp. 30, 31, writes thus: "<span class="accented">It</span> is not idle, as it might seem at, first sight, to follow the stream of history beyond the horizon of the apostolic age. The fragmentary notices of its subsequent career reflect some light on the temper and disposition of the Galatian Church in St. Paul's day. To Catholic writers of a later date, indeed, the failings of its infancy seemed to be so faithfully reproduced in its mature age, that they invested the apostle's rebuke with a prophetic import. Asia Minor was the nursery of heresy: and of all the Asiatic Churches it was nowhere so rife as in Galatia. The Galatian capital [Ancyra] was the stronghold of the Montanist revival, which lingered on for more than two centuries, splitting into diverse sects, each distinguished by some fantastic or minute ritual observance. Here, too, were to be found Ophites, Manicheans, sectarians of all kinds." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Witchcraft (&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;)<p>Or sorcery.
