Believers are engaged in a conflict, in which they earnestly desire that grace may obtain full and speedy victory. And those who desire thus to give themselves up to be led by the Holy Spirit, are not under the law as a covenant of works, nor exposed to its awful curse. Their hatred of sin, and desires after holiness, show that they have a part in the salvation of the gospel. The works of the flesh are many and manifest. And these sins will shut men out of heaven. Yet what numbers, calling themselves Christians, live in these, and say they hope for heaven! The fruits of the Spirit, or of the renewed nature, which we are to do, are named. And as the apostle had chiefly named works of the flesh, not only hurtful to men themselves, but tending to make them so to one another, so here he chiefly notices the fruits of the Spirit, which tend to make Christians agreeable one to another, as well as to make them happy. The fruits of the Spirit plainly show, that such are led by the Spirit. By describing the works of the flesh and fruits of the Spirit, we are told what to avoid and oppose, and what we are to cherish and cultivate; and this is the sincere care and endeavour of all real Christians. Sin does not now reign in their mortal bodies, so that they obey it, Ro 6:12, for they seek to destroy it. Christ never will own those who yield themselves up to be the servants of sin. And it is not enough that we cease to do evil, but we must learn to do well. Our conversation will always be answerable to the principle which guides and governs us, Ro 8:5. We must set ourselves in earnest to mortify the deeds of the body, and to walk in newness of life. Not being desirous of vain-glory, or unduly wishing for the esteem and applause of men, not provoking or envying one another, but seeking to bring forth more abundantly those good fruits, which are, through Jesus Christ, to the praise and glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let us not be desirous of vainglory - The word used here (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  kenodoxoi) means "proud" or "vain" of empty advantages, as of birth, property, eloquence, or learning. The reference here is probably to the paltry competitions which arose on account of these supposed advantages. It is possible that this might have been one cause of the difficulties existing in the churches of Galatia, and the apostle is anxious wholly to check and remove it. The Jews prided themselves on their birth, and people are everywhere prone to overvalue the supposed advantages of birth and blood. The doctrines of Paul are, that on great and most vital respects people are on a level; that these things contribute nothing to salvation (notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>); and that Christians should esteem them of little importance, and that they should not be suffered to interfere with their fellowship, or to mar their harmony and peace.<p>Provoking one another - The sense is, that they who are desirous of vainglory, do provoke one another. They provoke those whom they regard as inferiors by a haughty carriage and a contemptuous manner toward them. They look upon them often with contempt; pass them by with disdain; treat them as beneath their notice; and this provokes on the other hand hard feeling, and hatred. and a disposition to take revenge. When people regard themselves as equal in their great and vital interests; when they feel that they are fellow-heirs of the grace of life; when they feel that they belong to one great family, and are in their great interests on a level; deriving no advantage from birth and blood; on a level as descendants of the same apostate father; as being themselves sinners; on a level at the foot of the cross, at the communion table, on beds of sickness, in the grave, and at the bar of God; when they feel this, then the consequences here referred to will be avoided. There will be no haughty carriage such as to provoke opposition; and on the other hand there will be no envy on account of the superior rank of others.<p>Envying one another - On account of their superior wealth, rank, talent, learning. The true way to cure envy is to make people feel that in their great and important interests they are on a level. Their great interests are beyond the grave. The distinctions of this life are temporary, and are comparative trifles. Soon all will be on a level in the grave, and at the bar of God and in heaven. Wealth, and honor, and rank do not avail there. The poorest man will wear as bright a crown as the rich; the man of most humble birth will be admitted as near the throne as he who can boast the longest line of illustrious ancestors. Why should a man who is soon to wear a "crown incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away," envy him who has a ducal coronet here, or a royal diadem - baubles that are soon to be laid aside forever? Why should he, though poor here, who is soon to inherit the treasures of heaven where "moth and rust do not corrupt," envy him who can walk over a few acres as his own, or who has accumulated a glittering pile of dust, soon to be left forever?<p>Why should he who is soon to wear the robes of salvation, made "white in the blood of the Lamb," envy him who is "clothed in purple and fine linen," or who can adorn himself and his family in the most gorgeous attire which art and skill can make, soon to give place to the winding-sheet; soon to be succeeded by the simple garb which the most humble wears in the grave? If men feel that their great interests are beyond the tomb: that in the important matter of salvation they are on a level; that soon they are to be undistinguished beneath the clods of the valley, how unimportant comparatively would it seem to adorn their bodies, to advance their name and rank and to improve their estates! The rich and the great would cease to look down with contempt on those of more humble rank, and the poor would cease to envy those above them, for they are soon to be their equals in the grave; their equals, perhaps their superiors in heaven! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

Ambitious of being thought wiser, and richer, and more valuable than others; of having the preeminence in the management of all affairs, and of having honour, esteem, and popular applause from men: this may well be called vain glory, since it is only in outward things, as wisdom, riches, strength, and honour, and not in God the giver of them, and who can easily take them away; and therefore is but for a time, and is quickly gone, and lies only in the opinion and breath of men. <p>Provoking one another; not to good works, which would be right, but to anger and wrath, which is contrary to Christian charity, or true love; which, as it is not easily provoked, so neither will it provoke others to evil things.

Indeed, as in outward term of expression this verse coheres with ver. 25, so also in substance it coheres strictly with the whole passage beginning with ver. 13; for this is throughout levelled against a spirit of contentiousness then rife in the Galatian Churches. One cause to which the apostle thinks this ill state of things to be especially due was the spirit of vainglory or self-vaunting - a weakness to which the Celtic race has ever been markedly prone (see Lightfoot's 'Introduction,' p. 14). The softened form of exhortation visible in the use of the first person plural has been traced also by many critics in the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> as if the writer meant to imply that they were not as yet really vainglorious, but were in danger of <span class="accented">becoming</span> so. This, however, is not so clear. This verb is often used when there is no reference at all intended to passing out of a former state into a new one, but simply as meaning" show one's self," "be in act, so and so." Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-2.htm">Romans 16:2</a>, "she hath been (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) a succourer of many;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6</a>, "found (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) blameless;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>, "what manner of men we showed ourselves (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>);" ibid., 1 Thessalonians 2:7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>. Very often is this verb so used in exhortations, and especially in the present tense; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>, "Be not (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) wise in your own conceits;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-16.htm">1 Corinthians 4:16</a>, "Be (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) imitators of me;" (so ibid., 1 Corinthians 11:1; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-32.htm">1 Corinthians 10:32</a>, "Be giving no occasion for stumbling (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>);" 14:20, "Be (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) not babes in understanding, but in understanding be (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) full-grown men;" and so often. In many of such cases there can be no reference to preceding conduct, whether in the way of approval or disapproval, but simply an exhortation to be or not to be so and so. The Authorized Version, therefore, is quite right in here rendering, "Let us not be," etc. The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> occurs only here in the New Testament, as the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is only found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>. The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> from which it is derived may be either "notion," "opinion," or "glory."

But here <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is considered by most critics to mean "affecting, desirous of, empty glory;" so the Authorized Version, "desirous of vain glory," where "vain glory" are two words, not one. Such empty glory would mean glory founded on distinctive qualities, which either are merely imaginary, not existing at all, or which, if there, give no real title to honour. Perhaps, however, the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> of this compound is always "notion," "opinion," only varying so far in meaning as sometimes to denote opinions respecting ourselves; as Suidas says, "<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, a vain thinking respecting one's self;" at other times, notions about ether matters. The best interpretation of the word as here used is suggested by the apostle's own words in the next chapter (ver. 3), "if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself." As again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>," Doing nothing through faction or through vain glory;" the sense of the second noun is illustrated by the converse, "But in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself," suggesting its meaning to be the disposition to claim a superiority over others which we are not entitled to. "Wise in our own conceits" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>) is one form of this vicious quality; but there are others, all, however, fundamentally and intensely inimical to a spirit of loving sympathy with other men. <span class="cmt_word">Provoking one another, envying one another</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">challenging one another</span>, <span class="accented">envying one another.</span> Here again are two Greek words found nowhere else in the New Testament <span class="accented">-</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;</span>. The rendering of the first in the Authorized Version, "provoking," is perhaps not meant in the sense in which this English verb is now commonly used, and in which it <span class="accented">also</span> frequently occurs in our English Bible, of "making angry," but in the proper sense of the Latin verb <span class="accented">prorocantes</span>, "challenging,' ' <span class="accented">e.g</span>., to legal controversy, or to battle, or to mutual comparative estimation in any way. Any superiority, real or imaginary, in gifts spiritual (as <span class="accented">eharisms</span>) or natural, in eloquence, in theological acquirements, in qualification for office, in public estimation, even in moral consistency (for what follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a> seems to point in this last direction), might be among the Galatians either an occasion for self-vaunting or a subject of envy on the part of those who felt themselves  cast in the shade. What it was in actual facts which gave the apostle Occasion for administering this implied reproof, it is impossible to conjecture Therein an evident correlation between the "challenging: on the part of those who felt themselves strong, and the "envying" on the part of those who found themselves weak; both faults being, however, traceable to one and the same root - the excessive wish to be thought much of. <p> <p> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Desirous of vainglory (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>N.T.o. Better, vainglorious. The noun &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; vainglory only <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>. In lxx see Wisd. 14:14; 4 Macc. 2:15; 8:18. Originally, vain opinion, error. Ignatius, Magn. xi., speaks of falling into &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; the hooks or clutches of error. &#x394;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; has not the sense of opinion in N.T., but that of reputation, glory. This compound means having a vain conceit of possessing a rightful claim to honor. Suidas defines any vain thinking about one's self. It implies a contrast with the state of mind which seeks the glory of God. The modes in which vainglory may show itself are pointed out in the two following participles, provoking and envying.<p>Provoking (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>N.T.o. lxx, only 2 Macc. 8:11. Lit. calling forth, challenging, and so stirring up strife. Very common in Class. </body></html>
