It is not as if you were ignorant of better things. The crucified Saviour, the one great object of faith, has been preached before you in a way too plain to be mistaken. It has been written, as it were, in large characters before your eyes. It could only be some kind of evil enchantment or fascination that has prevented you from looking upon it. You have given up Christ and gone back to the Law. Yet, let me ask you—and surely no other proof is needed—all this outpouring of spiritual gifts that you have enjoyed since you became Christian, to what do you owe it? Is that due to the Law and works, or is it due to Christ and faith in Him? The one system is spiritual, the other is carnal and material. Will you begin with what is high and descend to what is low? Will you by such a declension practically admit that all the persecutions that you underwent were undergone in a mistaken cause? (I can hardly believe it.) At this present moment the gift of spiritual grace and miraculous power still in some measure continues, and where it is seen, is it not in clear connection—not with legal observances—but with faith in Christ?<p>In the last section of the last chapter the Apostle had been gradually working away from the historical retrospect with which he had begun to the doctrinal polemic in which he is about to engage, and now he addresses the Galatians with impassioned directness and earnestness, upbraiding them with their shameful apostasy.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Foolish.</span>—The same word as that which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm" title="Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:">Luke 24:25</a>, “O ye fools and slow of heart,” and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-14.htm" title="I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.">Romans 1:14</a>, “wise and foolish,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm" title="But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.">1Timothy 6:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-3.htm" title="For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.">Titus 3:3</a>, but not the same as that which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-26.htm" title="And every one that hears these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, which built his house on the sand:">Matthew 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-17.htm" title="You fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?">Matthew 23:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-40.htm" title="You fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?">Luke 11:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-22.htm" title="Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,">Romans 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?">1Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-10.htm" title="We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are despised.">1Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-19.htm" title="For you suffer fools gladly, seeing you yourselves are wise.">2Corinthians 11:19</a>, &c. The combination, “fools and slow of heart,” helps to bring out its meaning. “Slow of heart” refers to deadness of the moral affections; “fools” and “foolish” to the absence or undisciplined condition of the reasoning faculty. The Gauls of Galatia were a people intellectually shallow and frivolous. A little reason and reflection would have kept them from so gross an inconsistency.<p><span class= "bld">Bewitched you.</span>—The Greek word for this is probably connected in origin with the Latin word from which is derived our own “fascinate,” and the idea prominent in both is that which is embodied in the popular superstition of the evil eye. This superstition lingers still, especially in some southern countries, such as Italy and Spain. In Italy it is well known under the names “jettatura,” “occhio cattivo.” In Spain its existence has been graphically illustrated by a picture of the late J. Phillip, R.A., now in the museum at Stirling.<p>The metaphor here is strikingly in harmony with that which follows. The cross of Christ has been “evidently set forth” (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> posted up in large and bold characters) before the Galatians, but some evil fascination (that of their Judaising teachers) has drawn away their eyes from looking upon it, and held them fixed upon another object (legal observances), as baneful as the cross was salutary.<p><span class= "bld">That ye should not obey the truth.</span>—These words are omitted by the best MSS. and by all recent editors. They were, without doubt, originally a gloss, put in to explain more fully the single word “bewitched.” As an explanation they are sufficiently right, but they certainly did not form part of the text as it left the hands of St. Paul.<p><span class= "bld">Evidently set forth.</span>—This hardly brings out the full force of the metaphor, which is that of a picture or writing conspicuously and publicly exhibited.<p><span class= "bld">Crucified.</span>—This word is emphatic: “Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.”<p><span class= "bld">Among you.</span>—If these words are to be retained in the text they must, of course, be taken, not with “crucified,” but with “evidently set forth.” They will then be a repetition, intended to enhance the force of the phrase “before whose eyes”—“before whose eyes and in whose very midst Jesus Christ was set forth crucified.” But the probability is that the words ought to be omitted altogether, as they are wanting in the four most ancient MSS., as well as in a majority of the oldest versions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/galatians/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Galatians<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE EVIL EYE AND THE CHARM</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm" title="O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?">Galatians 3:1</a>The Revised Version gives a shorter, and probably correct, form of this vehement question. It omits the two clauses ‘that ye should not obey the truth’ and ‘among you.’ The omission increases the sharpness of the thrust of the interrogation, whilst it loses nothing of the meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, a very striking metaphor runs through the whole of this question, which may easily be lost sight of by ordinary readers. You know the old superstition as to the Evil Eye, almost universal at the date of this letter and even now in the East, and lingering still amongst ourselves. Certain persons were supposed to have the power, by a look, to work mischief, and by fixing the gaze of their victims, to suck the very life out of them. So Paul asks who the malign sorcerer is who has thus fascinated the fickle Galatians, and is draining their Christian life out of their eyes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Very appropriately, therefore, if there is this reference, which the word translated ‘bewitched’ carries with it, he goes on to speak about Jesus Christ as having been displayed before their eyes. They had seen Him. How did they come to be able to turn away to look at anything else?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But there is another observation to be made by way of introduction, and that is as to the full force of the expression ‘evidently set forth.’ The word employed, as commentators tell us, is that which is used for the display of official proclamations, or public notices, in some conspicuous place, as the Forum or the market, that the citizens might read. So, keeping up the metaphor, the word might be rendered, as has been suggested by some eminent scholars, ‘placarded’--’Before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been placarded.’ The expression has acquired somewhat ignoble associations from modern advertising, but that is no reason why we should lose sight of its force. So, then, Paul says, ‘In my preaching, Christ was conspicuously set forth. It is like some inexplicable enchantment that, having seen Him, you should turn away to gaze on others.’ It is insanity which evokes wonder, as well as sin which deserves rebuke; and the fiery question of my text conveys both.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Keeping to the metaphor, I note first the placard which Paul had displayed.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Jesus Christ crucified has been conspicuously set forth before you,’ he says to these Galatians. Now, he is referring, of course, to his own work of preaching the Gospel to them at the beginning. And the vivid metaphor suggests very strikingly two things. We see in it the Apostle’s notion of what He had to do. His had been a very humble office, simply to hang up a proclamation. The one virtue of a proclamation is that it should be brief and plain. It must be authoritative, it must be urgent, it must be ‘writ large,’ it must be easily intelligible. And he that makes it public has nothing to do except to fasten it up, and make sure that it is legible. If I might venture into modern phraseology, what Paul means is that he was neither more nor less than a bill-sticker, that he went out with the placards and fastened them up.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ah! if we ministers universally acted up to the implications of this metaphor, do you not think the pulpit would be more frequently a centre of power than it is to-day? And if, instead of presenting our own ingenuities and speculations, we were to realise the fact that we have to hide ourselves behind the broad sheet that we fasten up, there would be a new breath over many a moribund church, and we should hear less of the often warrantable sarcasms about the inefficiency of the modern pulpit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But I turn from Paul’s conception of the office to his statement of his theme. ‘_Jesus_ was displayed amongst you.’ If I might vary the metaphor a little, the placard that Paul fastened up was like those that modern advertising ingenuity displays upon all our walls. It was a picture-placard, and on it was portrayed one sole figure--Jesus, the Person. Christianity is Christ, and Christ is Christianity; and wherever there is a pulpit or a book which deals rather with doctrines than with Him who is the Fountain and Quarry of all doctrine, there is divergence from the primitive form of the Gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I know, of course, that doctrines--which are only formal and orderly statements of principles involved in the facts--must flow from the proclamation of the person, Christ. I am not such a fool as to run amuck against theology, as some people in this day do. But what I wish to insist upon is that the first form of Christianity is not a theory, but a history, and that the revelation of God is the biography of a man. We must begin with the person, Christ, and preach Him. Would that all our preachers and all professing Christians, in their own personal religious life, had grasped this--that, since Christianity is not first a philosophy but a history, and its centre not an ordered sequence of doctrines but a living person, the act that makes a man possessor of Christianity is not the intellectual process of assimilating certain truths, and accepting them, but the moral process of clinging, with trust and love, to the person, Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, further, if any of you consult the original, you will see that the order of the sentence is such as to throw a great weight of emphasis on that last word ‘crucified.’ It is not merely a person that is portrayed on the placard, but it is that person _upon the Cross_. Ah! brethren, Paul himself puts his finger, in the words of my text, on what, in his conception, was the throbbing heart of all his message, the vital point from which all its power, and all the gleam of its benediction, poured out upon humanity--’Christ crucified.’ If the placard is a picture of Christ in other attitudes and in other aspects, without the picture of Him crucified, it is an imperfect representation of the Gospel that Paul preached and that Christ was.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Now, think, secondly, of the fascinators that draw away the eyes.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul’s question is not one of ignorance, but it is a rhetorical way of rebuking, and of expressing wonder. He knew, and the Galatians knew, well enough who it was that had bewitched them. The whole letter is a polemic worked in fire, and not in frost, as some argumentation is, against a very well-marked class of teachers--viz. those emissaries of Judaism who had crept into the Church, and took it as their special function to dog Paul’s steps amongst the heathen communities that he had gathered together through faith in Christ, and used every means to upset his work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I cannot but pause for a moment upon this original reference of my text, because it is very relevant to the present condition of things amongst us. These men whom Paul is fighting as if he were in a sawpit with them, in this letter, what was their teaching? This: they did not deny that Jesus was the Christ; they did not deny that faith knit a man to Him, but what they said was that the observance of the external rites of Judaism was necessary in order to entrance into the Church and to salvation. They did not in their own estimation detract from Christ, but they added to Him. And Paul says that to add is to detract, to say that anything is necessary except faith in Jesus Christ’s finished work is to deny that that finished work, and faith in it, are the means of salvation; and the whole evangelical system crumbles into nothingness if once you admit that.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, is there anybody to-day who is saying the same things, with variations consequent upon change of external conditions? Are there no people within the limits of the Christian Church who are reiterating the old Jewish notion that external ceremonies--baptism and the Lord’s Supper--are necessary to salvation and to connection with the Christian Church? And is it not true now, as it was then, that though they do not avowedly detract, they so represent these external rites as to detract, from the sole necessity of faith in the perfected work of Jesus Christ? The centre is shifted from personal union with a personal Saviour by a personal faith to participation in external ordinances. And I venture to think that the lava stream which, in this Epistle to the Galatians, Paul pours on the Judaisers of his day needs but a little deflection to pour its hot current over, and to consume, the sacramentarian theories of this day. ‘O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you?’ Is it not like some malignant sorcery, that after the Evangelical revival of the last century and the earlier part of this, there should spring up again this old, old error, and darken the simplicity of the Gospel teaching, that Christ’s work, apprehended by faith, without anything else, is the means, and the only means, of salvation?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But I need not spend time upon that original application. Let us rather come more closely to our own individual lives and their weaknesses. It is a strange thing, so strange that if one did not know it by one’s own self, one would be scarcely disposed to believe it possible, that a man who has ‘tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come,’ and has known Jesus Christ as Saviour and Friend, should decline from Him, and turn to anything besides. And yet, strange and sad, and like some enchantment as it is, it is the experience at times and in a measure, of us all; and, alas! it is the experience, in a very tragical degree, of many who have walked for a little while behind the Master, and then have turned away and walked no more with Him. We may well wonder; but the root of the mischief is in no baleful glitter of a sorcerer’s eye without us, but it is in the weakness of our own wills and the waywardness of our own hearts, and the wandering of our own affections. We often court the coming of the evil influence, and are willing to be fascinated and to turn our backs upon Jesus. Mysterious it is, for why should men cast away diamonds for paste? Mysterious it is, for we do not usually drop the substance to get the shadow. Mysterious it is, for a man does not ordinarily empty his pockets of gold in order to fill them with gravel. Mysterious it is, for a thirsty man will not usually turn away from the full, bubbling, living fountain, to see if he can find any drops still remaining, green with scum, stagnant and odorous, at the bottom of some broken cistern. But all these follies are sanity as compared with the folly of which we are guilty, times without number, when, having known the sweetness of Jesus Christ, we turn away to the fascinations of the world. Custom, the familiarity that we have with Him, the attrition of daily cares--like the minute grains of sand that are cemented on to paper, and make a piece of sandpaper that is strong enough to file an inscription off iron--the seductions of worldly delights, the pressure of our daily cares--all these are as a ring of sorcerers that stand round about us, before whom we are as powerless as a bird in the presence of a serpent, and they bewitch us and draw us away.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sad fact has been verified over and over again on a large scale in the history of the Church. After every outburst of renewed life and elevated spirituality there is sure to come a period of reaction when torpor and formality again assert themselves. What followed the Reformation in Germany? A century of death. What followed Puritanism in England? An outburst of lust and godlessness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So it has always been, and so it is with us individually, as we too well know. Ah, brethren! the seductions are omnipresent, and our poor eyes are very weak, and we turn away from the Lord to look on these misshapen monsters that are seeking by their gaze to draw us into destruction. I wonder how many professing Christians are in this audience who once saw Jesus Christ a great deal more clearly, and contemplated Him a great deal more fixedly, and turned their hearts to Him far more lovingly, than they do to-day? Some of the great mountain peaks of Africa are only seen for an hour or two in the morning, and then the clouds gather around them, and hide them for the rest of the day. It is like the experience of many professing Christians, who see Him in the morning of their Christian life far more vividly than they ever do after. ‘Who hath bewitched you?’ The world; but the arch-sorcerer sits safe in our own hearts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Lastly, keeping to the metaphor, let me suggest, although my text does not touch upon it, the Amulet.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>One has seen fond mothers in Egypt and Palestine who hang on their babies’ necks charms, to shield them from the influence of the Evil Eye; and there is a charm that we may wear if we will, which will keep us safe. There is no fascination in the Evil Eye if you do not look at it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The one object that the sorcerer has is to withdraw our gaze from Christ; it is not illogical to say that the way to defeat the object is to keep our gaze fixed on Christ. If you do not look at the baleful glitter of the Evil Eye it will exercise no power over you; and if you will steadfastly look at Him, then, and only then, you will not look at it. Like Ulysses in the legend, bandage the eyes and put wax in the ears, if you would neither be tempted by hearing the songs, nor by seeing the fair forms, of the sirens on their island. To look fixedly at Jesus Christ, and with the resolve never to turn away from Him, is the only safety against these tempting delights around us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, brethren, it is the crucified Christ, looking to whom, we are safe amidst all seductions and snares. I doubt whether a Christ who did not die for men has power enough over men’s hearts and minds to draw them to Himself. The cords which bind us to Him are the assurance of His dying love which has conquered us. If only we will, day by day, and moment by moment, as we pass through the duties and distractions, the temptations and the trials, of this present life, by an act of will and thought turn ourselves to Him, then all the glamour of false attractiveness will disappear from the temptations around us, and we shall see that the sirens, for all their fair forms, end in loathly fishes’ tails and sit amidst dead men’s bones.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Brethren, ‘looking _off_ unto Jesus’ is the secret of triumph over the fascinations of the world. And if we will habitually so look, then the sweetness that we shall experience will destroy all the seducing power of lesser and earthly sweetness, and the blessed light of the sun will dim and all but extinguish the deceitful gleams that tempt us into the swamps where we shall be drowned. Turn away, then, from these things; cleave to Jesus Christ; and though in ourselves we may be as weak as a humming-bird before a snake, or a rabbit before a tiger, He will give us strength, and the light of His face shining down upon us will fix our eyes and make us insensible to the fascinations of the sorcerers. So we shall not need to dread the question, ‘Who hath bewitched you?’ but ourselves challenge the utmost might of the fascination with the triumphant question, ‘Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Help us, O Lord! we beseech Thee, to live near Thee. Turn away our eyes from beholding vanity, and enable us to set the Lord always before us that we be not moved. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm" title="O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?">Galatians 3:1</a></span>. St Paul having, by many arguments, proved himself to be a real apostle, and showed that his knowledge of the gospel was given him by immediate revelation from the Lord Jesus, proceeds in this and the following chapter to treat of the doctrines in dispute between him and the false teachers, and especially of that of justification, which these Jewish teachers affirmed could not be obtained by the Gentiles unless they were circumcised, and observed the ceremonies of the law of Moses; but which Paul insisted, was simply and only by faith in Christ. And to impress the Galatians the more strongly with a sense of the danger of the doctrine which his opposers taught, he here charges them with want of understanding or consideration, for listening to it, saying: <span class="ital">O foolish Galatians — </span>Or <span class="ital">thoughtless, </span>as the word <span class="greekheb">ανοητοι </span>may be properly rendered; for it not only signifies persons void of understanding, but also persons who, though they have understanding, do not form right judgments of things, through want of consideration. “The apostle, by calling the Galatians <span class="ital">foolish, </span>doth not contradict our Saviour’s doctrine, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>,) because he doth it not, <span class="greekheb">εικη</span>, <span class="ital">rashly, </span>without cause, saith Theophylact, nor out of anger and ill-will to them, but from an ardent desire to make them sensible of their folly.” — Whitby. <span class="ital">Who hath bewitched, </span>or deceived, <span class="ital">you </span>— For the word <span class="greekheb">βασκανειν </span>is often used for deceiving another with false appearances, after the manner of jugglers; <span class="ital">that</span> <span class="ital">ye should not obey — </span>Should not continue to obey, that is, to be persuaded of, and influenced by; <span class="ital">the truth </span>— That has been so fully declared and proved to you; <span class="ital">before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth </span>— By our preaching; as if he had been <span class="ital">crucified among you — </span>As if he had said, Who hath so deluded you, as to prevail with you thus to contradict both your own reason and experience? For ye have been as fully and clearly informed of the nature and design of Christ’s sufferings, as if they had been endured by him in your very sight; and you have witnessed their efficacy in procuring for you reconciliation with God, peace of conscience, and the gift of the Holy Spirit.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-5 Several things made the folly of the Galatian Christians worse. They had the doctrine of the cross preached, and the Lord's supper administered among them, in both which Christ crucified, and the nature of his sufferings, had been fully and clearly set forth. Had they been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, by the ministration of the law, or on account of any works done by them in obedience thereto? Was it not by their hearing and embracing the doctrine of faith in Christ alone for justification? Which of these had God owned with tokens of his favour and acceptance? It was not by the first, but the last. And those must be very unwise, who suffer themselves to be turned away from the ministry and doctrine which have been blessed to their spiritual advantage. Alas, that men should turn from the all-important doctrine of Christ crucified, to listen to useless distinctions, mere moral preaching, or wild fancies! The god of this world, by various men and means, has blinded men's eyes, lest they should learn to trust in a crucified Saviour. We may boldly demand where the fruits of the Holy Spirit are most evidently brought forth? whether among those who preach justification by the works of the law, or those who preach the doctrine of faith? Assuredly among the latter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O foolish Galatians - That is, foolish for having yielded to the influence of the false teachers, and for having embraced doctrines that tended to subvert the gospel of the Redeemer. The original word used here (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  anoe&#772;toi) denotes void of understanding; and they had shown it in a remarkable manner in rejecting the doctrine of the apostles, and in embracing the errors into which they had fallen. It will be remembered that this is an expression similar to what was applied to them by others; see the introduction, Section I. Thus, Callimachus in his hymns calls them "a foolish people," and Hillary, himself a Gaul, calls them Gallos indociles, expressions remarkably in accordance with that used here by Paul. It is implied that they were without stability of character. The particular thing to which Paul refers here is that they were so easily led astray by the arguments of the false teachers.<p>Who hath bewitched you - The word used here (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  ebaskanen) properly means, to prate about anyone; and then to mislead by pretences, as if by magic arts; to fascinate; to influence by a charm. The idea here is, that they had not been led by reason and by sober judgment, but that there must have been some charm or fascination to have taken them away in this manner from what they had embraced as true, and what they had the fullest evidence was true. Paul had sufficient confidence in them to believe that they had not embraced their present views under the unbiassed influence of judgment and reason, but that there must have been some fascination or charm by which it was done. It was in fact accomplished by the arts and the plausible pretences of those who came from among the Jews.<p>That ye should not obey the truth - The truth of the gospel. That you should yield your minds to falsehood and error. It should be observed, however, that this phrase is lacking in many manuscripts. It is omitted in the Syriac version; and many of the most important Greek and Latin Fathers omit it. Mill thinks it should be omitted; and Griesbach has omitted it. It is not essential to the passage in order to the sense; and it conveys no truth which is not elsewhere taught fully. It is apparently added to show what was the effect of their being bewitched or enchanted.<p>Before whose eyes - In whose very presence. That is, it has been done so clearly that you may be said to have seen it.<p>Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth - By the preaching of the gospel. He has been so fully and plainly preached that you may be said to have seen him. The effect of his being preached in the manner in which it has been done, ought to have been as great as if you had seen him crucified before your eyes. The word rendered "hath been evidently set forth" (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#837;  proegraphe&#772;), means properly to write before; and then to announce beforehand in writing; or to announce by posting up on a tablet. The meaning here is, probably, that Christ has been announced among them crucified, as if the doctrine was set forth in a public written tablet - Robinson's Lexicon. There was the utmost clearness and distinctness of view, so that they need not make any mistake in regard to him. The Syriac renders it, "Christ has been crucified before your eyes as if he had been represented by painting." According to this, the idea is, that it was as plain as if there had been a representation of him by a picture. This has been done chiefly by preaching. I see no reason, however, to doubt that Paul means also to include the celebration of the Lord's supper, in which the Lord Jesus is so clearly exhibited as a crucified Saviour.<p>Crucified among you - That is, represented among you as crucified. The words "among you," however, are lacking in many manuscripts and obscure the sense. If they are to be retained, the meaning is, that the representations of the Lord Jesus as crucified had been as clear and impressive among them as if they had seen him with their own eyes, The argument is, that they had so clear a representation of the Lord Jesus, and of the design of his death, that it was strange that they had so soon been perverted from the belief of it. Had they seen the Saviour crucified; had they stood by the cross and witnessed his agony in death on account of sin, how could they doubt what was the design of his dying, and how could they be seduced from faith in his death, or be led to embrace any other method of justification? How could they now do it, when, although they had not seen him die, they had the fullest knowledge of the object for which he gave his precious life? The doctrine taught in this verse is that a faithful exhibition of the sufferings and death of the Saviour ought to exert an influence over our minds and hearts as if we had seen him die; and that they to whom such an exhibition has been made should avoid being led astray by the blandishments of false doctrines and by the arts of man. If we had seen the Saviour expire, we could never have forgotten the scene! Let us endeavor to cherish a remembrance of his sufferings and death as if we had seen him die. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>Ga 3:1-29.

"You, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been graphically set forth (literally, in writing, namely, by vivid portraiture in preaching) among you, crucified" (so the sense and Greek order require rather than English Version). As Christ was "crucified," so ye ought to have been by faith "crucified with Christ," and so "dead to the law" (Ga 2:19, 20). Reference to the "eyes" is appropriate, as fascination was supposed to be exercised through the eyes.

Referring not to any national character, as some have thought, by which they were distinguished from others for their rudeness in knowledge, their ignorance and folly, as the Cretians for their lying, &amp;c. nor to their former state in unregeneracy, it being common to all men, to God's elect themselves, before conversion, to be foolish in a moral and spiritual sense; but to their present stupidity about the article of justification, it being an instance of most egregious folly to leave Christ for Moses, the Gospel for the law, and the doctrine of free justification by the righteousness of Christ, which brings so much solid peace and comfort with it, for the doctrine of justification, by the works of the law, which naturally leads to bondage. Now this was said, not rashly, nor in anger, or on purpose to reproach and provoke, and so not at all contrary to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a> but in like manner as Christ said to his disciples, "O fools, and slow of heart to believe", &amp;c. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25</a>. So the apostle here, as pitying the Galatians, grieved for them, and as one surprised and astonished that ever people of such light, that had had the Gospel so clearly preached to them, should ever give into such a notion. <p>Who hath bewitched you? some false teacher or another had, or it cannot be conceived how their heads should ever have been turned this way; which must be understood, not in a literal and proper sense, as Simon Magus bewitched the people of Samaria with his sorceries, but in a figurative and improper one; that as sorcerers and enchanters cast a mist before people's eyes, or, by some evil arts or juggling tricks, deceive their sight, and make objects seem to appear which do not, or in a different form than they really do, so these deceitful workers, who had transformed themselves into the apostles of Christ, as Satan sometimes transforms himself into an angel of light, had set this doctrine in a false light before them, thereby to corrupt their minds from the simplicity that is in Christ. Though the apostle reproves the Galatians for their folly and weakness in giving in so easily to such deceptions, yet he imputes the chief fault unto, and lays the greatest blame on the false teachers; whom he represents as sorcerers and enchanters, and their doctrine, particularly that of justification by works, as witchcraft; it being pleasing to men, a gratifying of carnal reason, and operating as a charm upon the pride of human nature. What Samuel said to Saul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> may be applied to the present case, "to obey" the truth "is better than sacrifice", than all the rituals of the ceremonial law: "and to hearken" to the Gospel of Christ, "than the fat of rams", or any of the legal institutions; "for rebellion" against, and opposition to any of the doctrines of the Gospel, and especially to this of justification by the righteousness of Christ, "is as the sin of witchcraft". The Greek word,  signifies "to envy", and hence, "to bewitch"; because the mischief, by witchcrafts, generally proceeds from envy; and so the Syriac version, which the Arabic follows, renders it,  , "who hath envied you", which suggests this sense, that the false apostles envying their light and knowledge in the Gospel, their faith, peace, comfort, and happiness, had endeavoured to introduce another doctrine among them, subversive of all this. <p>That ye should not obey the truth. This clause is left out in the Alexandrian copy, and in some others, and in the Syriac version. By "the truth" is meant, either the whole Gospel, often so called, in opposition to the law, and the types and shadows of it; and because it is contained in the Scriptures of truth, and comes from the God of truth; the substance of it is Christ, who is the truth, and is what the Spirit of truth leads into; or else particularly the doctrine of justification by the righteousness of Christ, which is the truth the apostle is establishing, and these Galatians seemed to be going off from, through the artful insinuations of the false teachers. Formerly these people had not only heard this truth, but embraced it: they received the love of it, were strongly affected to it, and firmly believed but now they began to hesitate and doubt about it; they were not so fully persuaded of it as heretofore; they seemed ready to let it go, at least did not hold it fast, and the profession of it, without wavering as before; they were fallen from some degree of the steadfastness of their faith in, and of the obedience of it to this truth, which is what was the design of the false apostles, and is here charged upon the Galatians. The aggravations of which follow in this, and in some subsequent verses, <p>before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth; meaning in the ministry of the Gospel, in the clear preaching of it by the apostle; Jesus Christ was the sum and substance of his ministry, in which he was set forth and described, and, as it were, painted to the life by him; the glories and excellencies of his divine person, the nature of his office, as Mediator, the suitableness of him as a Saviour, the fulness of his grace, the efficacy of his blood, sacrifice, and righteousness, were so fully, and in such a lively manner expressed, that it was as if Christ was personally and visibly present with them; yea, he was so described in his sufferings and death, as hanging, bleeding, dying on the accursed tree, that he seemed to be as it were, as the apostle adds, <p>crucified among you: for this cannot be understood literally, for he was crucified without the gates of Jerusalem; nor does it respect the sin of the Galatians in departing from the Gospel, as if that was a crucifying of him again, and a putting him to open shame; nor their sufferings for the sake of Christ, as if he, in that sense, was crucified in them, and with them: but it intends the clear Gospel revelation of a crucified Christ, in the preaching of him by the apostle, which was such that no picture, no image, no crucifix would come up to, and which, where such preaching is, are altogether vain and needless; and the clear view these saints had, by faith, in the glass of the Gospel of Christ, and him crucified, which so realized the object, as if it was present and before the natural eye. Now this was an aggravation of their weakness and folly, that after such clear preaching, and clear sight, they had of the Gospel, and of Christ in it, that they should in the least degree depart from it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">O <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</span><p>(1) The third reason or argument taken of those gifts of the Holy Spirit, with which they were endued from heaven after they had heard and believed the gospel by Paul's ministry.

Beitr</span>. 1854, p. 211 f.) even mixes up a stigmatization with the marks of Christ’s wounds, which Paul, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-17.htm" title="From now on let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.">Galatians 6:17</a>, is supposed to have borne on his own body. But these interpretations are opposed not only by the words <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> (see below), but also by the <span class="ital">usus loquendi</span>. For, however frequent may be the occurrence of <span class="greekheb">γράφειν</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">to paint</span>, this signification can by no means be proved as to <span class="greekheb">προγράφειν</span>, not even in Arist. <span class="ital">Av</span>. 450 (see Rettig in <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1830, p. 97). The Greek expression for <span class="ital">showing how to paint, tracing out</span>, in the sense of a picture given to copy, is <span class="greekheb">ὑπογράφειν</span>. Following Elsner and others, Morus, Flatt, and Schott understand it as <span class="ital">palam scriptus est</span> (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/10-36.htm" title="I will further, that there be enrolled among the king's forces about thirty thousand men of the Jews, unto whom pay shall be given, as belongeth to all king's forces.">1Ma 10:36</a>; Lucian, <span class="ital">Tim</span>. 51; Plut. <span class="ital">Mor</span>. p. 408 D, Demetr. 46, Camill. 11 <span class="ital">et al</span>.[112]): “ita Christus vobis est oboculos palam descriptus, <span class="ital">quasi in tabula vobis praescriptus</span>,” Morus. This is inconsistent with <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>, for these words cannot be joined with <span class="greekheb">ἐσταυρωμένος</span> (see below); and Schott’s interpretation: <span class="ital">in animis vestris</span>—so that what was said figuratively by <span class="greekheb">οἷς</span> … <span class="greekheb">προεγρ</span>. is now more exactly defined <span class="ital">sermone proprio</span> by <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>—makes the <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> appear simply as something quite foreign and unsuitable in the connection, by which the figure is <span class="ital">marred</span>. In the two other passages where Paul uses <span class="greekheb">προγράφειν</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-4.htm" title="For whatever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.">Romans 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a>) it means <span class="ital">to write beforehand</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">πρό</span> has a <span class="ital">temporal</span> and not a <span class="ital">local</span> signification (comp. Ptol. viii. 25. 15, and see Hermann on our passage); nor is the meaning different in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-4.htm" title="And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.">Judges 1:4</a> (see Huther). And so it is to be taken here.[113] Paul represents his previous <span class="ital">preaching</span> of Christ as crucified to the Galatians figuratively as a writing, which he had <span class="ital">previously written</span> (<span class="greekheb">προεγράφη</span>) <span class="ital">in their hearts</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:">2 Corinthians 3:2</a> f. In this view <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ὀφθαλμούς</span> is that trait of the figure, by which the personal <span class="ital">oral</span> instruction is characterized: Paul formerly wrote Christ <span class="ital">before their eyes</span> in their hearts, when he <span class="ital">stood before them and preached the word of the cross, which through his preaching impressed itself on their hearts</span>. By his vivid illustration he recalls the fact to his readers, who had just been so misled by a preaching altogether different (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:">Galatians 1:6</a>). With no greater boldness than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:">2 Corinthians 3:2</a> f., he has <span class="ital">moulded</span> the figure <span class="ital">according to the circumstances of the case</span>, as he is wont to do in figurative language (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm" title="My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,">Galatians 4:19</a>); but this does not warrant a pressing of the figure to prove traits physically imcompatible (an objection urged by Reiche). Jerome and others, also Hermann, Bretschneider, and Rettig, <span class="ital">l.c</span>. p. 98 ff., have indeed correctly kept to the meaning <span class="ital">olim scribere</span> (Rettig, however, remarking undecidedly, that it may also mean <span class="ital">palam scribere</span>), but have quite inappropriately referred it to the <span class="ital">prophecies of the O.T.:</span> “quibus ante oculos praedictio fuit Christi in crucem sublati,” Hermann. Apart from the circumstance that the <span class="ital">precise</span> mode of death by <span class="ital">crucifixion</span> is not mentioned in the prophetical utterances, this would constitute a ground for surprise on the part of the apostle of a nature much too general, not founded on the personal relation of Paul to his readers, and therefore by no means adequate as a motive; and, in fact, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-2.htm" title="This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?...">Galatians 3:2-4</a> carry back their memory to <span class="ital">the time, when</span> Paul <span class="ital">was at work among them</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>] is not, with Grotius, Usteri, and others, to be set aside as a Hebrew pleonasm (<span class="greekheb">אֲשֶׁר בָּכֶם</span>), but is to be understood as <span class="ital">in animis vestris</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="You are our letter written in our hearts, known and read of all men:">2 Corinthians 3:2</a>; Soph. <span class="ital">Phil</span>. 1309: <span class="greekheb">γράφου φρενῶν ἔσω</span>; Aesch. <span class="ital">Prom</span>. 791, <span class="ital">Suppl</span>. 991, <span class="ital">Choeph</span>. 450), and belongs to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΕΓΡΆΦΗ</span></span></span>; in which case, however, the latter cannot mean either <span class="ital">palam pictus</span> or <span class="ital">palam scriptus est</span>, because then <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span> would involve a <span class="ital">contradictio in adjecto</span>, and would not be a fitting epexegesis of <span class="greekheb">οἷς</span> (Winer, comp. Schott), for the <span class="ital">depicting</span> and the <span class="ital">placarding</span> cannot take place otherwise than on something external. To take <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> as <span class="ital">among you</span> and connect it with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΕΓΡ</span></span></span>., would yield not a <span class="ital">strengthening</span> of <span class="greekheb">οἷς</span> (as de Wette holds), but an empty addition, from which Reiche and Wieseler also obtain nothing more than a purport obvious of itself.[114] On the other hand, Hofmann hits upon the expedient of dividing the words <span class="greekheb">οἷς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐσταυρ</span>. into <span class="ital">two independent</span> sentences: (1) <span class="ital">Before whose eyes is Jesus Christ;</span> (2) <span class="ital">as the Crucified One, He has been freely and publicly delineated among you</span>. But, apart from the linguistically incorrect view of <span class="greekheb">προεγράφη</span>, this dismemberment would give to the language of the passage a violently abrupt form, which is the more intolerable, as Paul does not dwell further on the asyndetically introduced <span class="greekheb">προεγρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν ἐσταυρ</span>. or subjoin to it any more particular statement, but, on the contrary, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm" title="This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:2</a> brings forward asyndetically a new thought. Instead of introducing it abruptly in a way so liable to misapprehension, he would have subjoined <span class="greekheb">προεγράφη</span>—if it was not intended to belong to <span class="greekheb">οἷς</span>—in some simple form by <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> or <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> or <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span> or <span class="greekheb">ὅσγε</span>. Without any impropriety, he might, on the other hand, figuratively represent that he who preaches Christ to others <span class="ital">writes</span> (not <span class="ital">placards</span> or <span class="ital">depicts</span>) Christ before their eyes in their hearts. Most expositors connect <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐσταυρ</span>., and explain either as <span class="ital">propter vos</span> (Koppe), contrary to the use of <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> with <span class="ital">persons</span> (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-24.htm" title="And they glorified God in me.">Galatians 1:24</a>); or, unsuitably to the figurative idea <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ὀφθαλμοὺς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">in animis vestris</span>;[115] or (as usually) <span class="ital">inter vos:</span> “so clearly, so evidently … just as if crucified among you,” Rückert. But the latter must have been expressed by <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐν ὑμῖν ἐσταυρ</span>., and would also presuppose that the apostle’s preaching of the cross had embodied a vivid and detailed <span class="ital">description</span> of the crucifixion. It was not this however, but the <span class="ital">fact itself</span> (as the <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span>), which formed the sum and substance of the preaching of the cross; as is certain from the apostle’s letters. Lastly, Luther’s peculiar interpretation, justly rejected by Calovius, but nevertheless again adopted in substance by Matthias,—that <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν ἐσταυρ</span>. is a severe <span class="ital">censure, “quod Christus</span> (namely, after the rejection of grace) <span class="ital">non vivit, sed mortuus in eis est</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-6.htm" title="If they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.">Hebrews 6:6</a>),” which Paul had laid before them <span class="ital">argumentis praedictis</span>,—is as far-fetched, as alien from the usual Pauline mode of expression, and as unsuitable to the context as the view of Cajetanus, that, according to the idea “Christ suffers in His members” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>), <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐσταυρ</span>. is equivalent to <span class="ital">for the sake of whom ye have suffered so much</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐσταυρ</span>.] <span class="ital">as the Crucified One</span>, is with great emphasis moved on to the end. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-2.htm" title="For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[112] On this meaning is based the interpretation of Ambrose, Augustine, and Lyra, “He was <span class="ital">proscribed</span>, that is, condemned,” which is indeed admissible so far as usage goes (Polyb. xxxii. 21, 12, xxxii. 22, 1; Plut. <span class="ital">Brut</span>. 27), but quite unsuitable to the context. Comp. Vulgate: <span class="ital">proscriptus est</span>, instead of which, however, Lachmann has <span class="ital">praescriptus est</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[113] So taken correctly also by Matthias, who, however, explains the expression from the idea of an <span class="ital">amulet</span> used against the <span class="ital">enchantment</span>. But this idea would presuppose some <span class="ital">secret writing</span>, the very opposite of which is conveyed by the expression.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[114] Reiche, “id factum esse a se, gentium apostolo, <span class="ital">inter eos praesente</span>” (not, it might be, <span class="ital">alio loco</span> or <span class="ital">per homines sublestae fidei</span>, not <span class="ital">clanculum</span>, but <span class="ital">cunctis, publico eorum conventu</span>, etc.). Wieseler: “not merely <span class="ital">from a distance</span> by means of an <span class="ital">epistle</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[115] To this category belongs Bengel’s mystical interpretation, “<span class="ital">forma crucis</span> ejus in corde vestro per fidem expressa, ut jam vos etiam cum illo crucefigeremini.” Thus the expression would signify the killing of the old man which had taken place through ethical fellowship in the death of Christ, to which <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐσταυρ</span>. is referred by Storr also. A similar view is taken by Jatho, <span class="ital">Br. an d.

Justification by Faith, the dispensation of the Spirit<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. In the concluding verses of the preceding chapter the Apostle has not been directly addressing the Galatians. He has rather been following up his rebuke to Peter by an argument—a soliloquy—ending in a <span class="ital">reductio ad absurdum</span>. A doctrine which practically makes the death of Christ superfluous is impious and revolting. ‘And is this the doctrine which you were lightly disposed to accept? O foolish Galatians, to what spell of sorcery have you succumbed? Christ Crucified was lifted up before you as the object of faith. Instead of looking away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm" title="Looking to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.">Hebrews 12:2</a>) from all else to Jesus Christ alone, you allowed your eyes to wander to the Law and your own works, and so yielded to the deadly fascination of these Judaizing teachers.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">O foolish Galatians</span>] The epithet ‘foolish’ does not refer to a national characteristic. The Galatians, like other Keltic races, were quick-witted. Their folly consisted in not seeing the inconsistency of the new teaching with their own experience (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm" title="This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:2</a></span>) and the impious conclusion to which it inevitably led, c. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-21.htm" title="I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.">Galatians 2:21</a>. Our Lord addressed the two disciples at Emmaus in the same terms—“O fools, &c.” <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm" title="Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:">Luke 24:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath bewitched</span>] Rather, ‘bewitched’, cast a spell over you, the allusion being to the time when they ‘so readily’ (c. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:">Galatians 1:6</a>) transferred their allegiance to the Judaizing teachers. The change so sudden, and so senseless, seems like the effect supposed to be produced by magical arts. This verb does not occur elsewhere in N. T., though not uncommon in Classical Greek. It is used of the spell which was supposed to be cast over persons, especially children, by the influence of the <span class="ital">evil eye</span>—a superstition prevalent in ancient times, and still existing in the East, in Italy and among the Kelts in Brittany. The word sometimes expresses, as here, the baneful effect on the victim, sometimes the feeling of envy or jealousy on the part of the agent. There may be a combination of these two ideas here; for St Paul alludes (c. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-17.htm" title="They zealously affect you, but not well; yes, they would exclude you, that you might affect them.">Galatians 4:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-12.htm" title="As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.">Galatians 6:12</a>) to the intense spirit of partisanship by which the Judaizers were actuated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that ye should not obey the truth</span>] Rightly omitted in the R.V. The clause is not found in the best MSS., and has probably been inserted from ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm" title="You did run well; who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?">Galatians 5:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">before whose eyes</span>] ‘to whom, confronting you, Christ was set forth’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath been evidently set forth crucified</span>] This of course does not imply that they had actually witnessed His Crucifixion—indeed the tense of the participle ‘crucified’ (better, ‘as having been crucified’) excludes such an explanation. One verb in the original stands for ‘hath been evidently set forth’. Render, ‘<span class="bld">was set forth</span>’. The same word occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-4.htm" title="For whatever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.">Romans 15:4</a>, where it is rightly translated “were written before”. It is not probable that this can be the sense in this passage, first, because there is no specific mention of our Lord’s death by <span class="ital">Crucifixion</span> in the Messianic prophecies of the O.T.; and secondly, because in such prophecies Christ could not be said to have been described as crucified ‘<span class="ital">before their eyes</span>’. Two other explanations (both in a figurative sense) have been adopted, (1) ‘was described as in a picture, was pourtrayed, or delineated’. This finds favour with Theod. Mops., Luther, Calvin, and others; and (2) ‘was publicly announced, proclaimed’. The latter sense is preferred by Bp. Lightfoot, on the ground of its being “the common word to describe all public notices or proclamations”. In Judges 4 we have a similar thought—‘whose names have been posted up as of men doomed to this condemnation’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">among you</span>] Omitted in many MSS. and in R.V.

The transporting feeling of elevation and joy with which, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19-21</a>, the apostle describes himself as crucified with Christ to the Law, and as living in Christ and through Christ, makes him the more keenly sensible of the senseless folly shown by the Galatians in taking up the observance of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truths?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>; [Receptus adds, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>]); <span class="accented">who in his envy did bewitch you</span>?

We have, therefore, to omit them and to read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as before <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is a remarkable word, and calls for comment. In common Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>, to treat one with malignant words, means either to slander, belie, blacken character, or to cast upon him primarily words conveying baleful spells, and then, in later usage very frequently, baleful spells of any kind, and more especially spells from the "evil eye" (Aristotle, Plutarch); in the language of old English superstition, "forelook" or "overlook." Indeed, so closely did this last notion cling to the verb, as to have suggested to Greek grammarians for its etymology, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to kill with the eyes." The more scientific etymologists of recent days derive it from <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1ffd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, speak; as if it were "to bespeak a man." The nouns <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, following the senses of the verb, express the ideas, either of envious detraction or of sorcery (see Schneider; Passow; Liddell and Scott). In the New Testament the word occurs only here. In the Septuagint we meet with it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54</a>, where, for the words, "His eye shall be evil towards his brother," we have <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, meaning apparently, "He shall grudge with his eye his brother;" and so again in ver. 56, the same phrase is used analogously of the tender woman, "She shall grudge with her eye her husband;" Ecclus. 14:6, "There is not a worse man (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) than he that grudges his own self;" ibid. ver. 8, "Evil is (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>) he that grudgeth with his eye. In Scripture, both in the Old Testament and the New, and in the Apocrypha, the phrases, "the eye being evil," "the evil eye," following the Hebrew, always denote envy, ill nature, niggardliness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54, 56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a> [comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>, "a bountiful eye"]; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-22.htm">Mark 7:22</a>). Nowhere either in the Scriptures or in the Apocrypha is there any reference to "forelooking," unless perchance the <span class="accented">me'onen</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10</a> (Authorized Version, "observer of times"), is etymologically connected with the Hebrew word for "eye," which, however, few critics suppose. Ignatius, 'Ad Romans', 3, has <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "never grudged any man." This Septuagintal use of the verb presents, as the reader will observe, a somewhat different shade of meaning to any of those cited above from the lexicons. Following, however, its guidance, we may  understand the apostle as here asking, "Whoso ill-natured jealousy was it that did light upon you?" and as intending to convey these two ideas: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the envy of their once happy state which actuated the agent referred to; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by <span class="accented">implication</span>, the baleful effect wrought by the envier upon them. The aorist of the verb seems to point to a decisive result. He had, it is hinted, succeeded in his wish; he had robbed them of the blessedness which had excited his jealousy. In respect to the former idea, elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-17.htm">Galatians 4:17</a>, "They would fain shut you out") the apostle ascribes the action of their misleaders to sinister designs against their well-being. It is, indeed, this thought that inspires the extreme severity of his language above in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>; the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, of whom he here speaks, belonged to, or derived from, <span class="accented">them.</span> In short, the pathetic question here before us breathes the like indignation and vexation as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>, "Ye were running on well: who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?" - the last words of which passage, though not admissible here in the text, would, however, if there, form a perfectly correct explanatory clause. The more distinctly to mark the effect actually produced by the envier, very many commentators have enwoven into their interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, besides its Septuagiutal sense, its other sense of blasting with some kind of charm: "The malignity," Chrysostom writes, "of a demon whose spirit [or, 'breath'] had blasted their prosperous estate." Great use has been made, in particular, by many, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jerome and, according to Estius, by Thomas Aquinas, of the superstition of the "evil eye," which, in the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, has in all ages been so rife. Bishop Lightfoot, in his interesting note on the passage, offers the following paraphrase: "Christ's death in vain? O ye senseless Gauls, what bewitchment is this? I placarded Christ crucified before your eyes. Ye suffered them to wander from this gracious proclamation of your King. They rested on the withering eye of the sorcerer. They yielded to the fascination and were riveted there. And the life of your souls has been drained out of you by that envious gaze." It may, however, be questioned whether the apostle would have recognized his own thought in this thorough-going application of the superstition of the "evil eye." It is doubtful whether he used the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> with reference to any species of sorcery at all; but if he did, he may have intended no more than this: "What envious ill-wisher has by some strange, inexplicable sorcery so wrought upon you? Or, how can I explain your behaviour, except that you have been acting under some binding spell? Surely such folly is well-nigh inconceivable with men in free possession of their own souls." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> each of these two renderings of the passage is open to the objection that St. Paul, in writing <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, either might have intended to express by the word "envious grudging," according to its Sep-tuagintal use, or he might have meant some kind of sorcery according to a common acceptation of the term, but could hardly have meant to convey both senses together. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The introduction of the supposition is inconvenient, not only because there could not have really been any such ingredient in the actual circumstances of the present case, but also because its mention would serve to excuse the folly of the Galatians, as indeed Chrysostom observes that it does, rather than to enhance its censure, which latter would have been more to the apostle's purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It seems especially improbable that the apostle was thinking of the "evil eye" when we consider the entire absence of its mention in the sacred writings. <span class="cmt_word">Before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>;); <span class="accented">to whom</span>, <span class="accented">before your very eyes</span>, <span class="accented">Jesus Christ had been</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was</span>) <span class="accented">aforetime</span> (or, <span class="accented">openly</span>) <span class="accented">set forth crucified</span> (<span class="accented">among you</span>)? The genuineness of the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "among you," is very doubtful. The Revised Greek text omits them. The words, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "before your very eyes," are very pointed; for the Greek expression, comp. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>), and Aristoph., 'Ran.,' 625, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x1fc3;</span>, "that he may say it to your very face." The sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span> is much disputed. It is not clear whether the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> is the "before" of time or of place. Of the other passages in the New Testament in which this compound verb occurs, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a> twice, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> is certainly, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a> probably, not so certainly (comp. 1 Macc. 10:36, "enrolled"), "before" of time. In the present passage a reference to the prophecies of the Old Testament seems out of place. It is far more suitable to the connection to suppose that the apostle is referring to his own preaching. Some commentators, retaining the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, connect them with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span> in the sense of "in you," comparing "Christ in you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>), and "written in your hearts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2</a>); and so render the words thus: "written of, or described, before in you." But such an expression, sufficiently awkward in itself, would further be very unsuitably introduced after the words, "before your very eyes." Supposing we take the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> as of time, there is no satisfactory explanation of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span>, if understood in the sense of <span class="cmt_word"></span> writing, there being no tablet (so to speak) suggested on which the writing could be conceived of as done. <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span>, it is true, means "describe" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>; but it is still a description in writing. We are, therefore, driven to assign to the verb the notion of portraying as in a painting, a sense which in Common Greek it certainly does sometimes bear, and which attaches to it in the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10</a> (Septuagint). We thus gain the sense, "had before been set forth or por trayed;" before (that is) the envier assailed you. This same sense, of portraying rather than of writing, would be also the best to give to the verb, supposing the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> to be understood as the "before" of place; which conception of the preposition Bishop Lightfoot contends for, urging the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and the nouns <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, with reference to the placards on which public notices were given of political or other matters of business. When, how ever, we consider how partial the apostle is to verbs compounded with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> of time, as is seen in his use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span>, not a few of which were probably compounded by himself as he wanted them, it appears highly probable that, to serve the present occasion, he here forms the compound <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> in the sense of "portraying before," the compound not existing elsewhere in the same sense. He compares, then, the idea of Christ crucified, presented to his hearers in his preaching, to a portraiture, in which the Redeemer had been so vividly and with such striking effect exhibited to his converts, that it ought in all reason have for ever safeguarded their souls against all danger from teaching of an alien character. If the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, be retained, it appears best, with Chrysostom and many others, to understand it as meaning, that St. Paul had presented Christ crucified in such lively colours to their view, that they had, <span class="accented">as it were</span>, seen him hanging on the cross in their very midst. The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, disconnected from <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> and at the end of the sen tence, gives it intense significance. What the idea of Christ crucified was to his own self, the apostle had just before declared; for him it at once had destroyed all spiritual connection with the ceremonial Law, the Law which bade the crucified One away from itself as accursed, and also by the infinite love to himself which he beheld manifested in Christ crucified <span class="accented">for him</span>, had bound him to him by spiritual ties both all-constrain ing and iudissoluble. And such (he means) should have been the effect produced by that idea upon <span class="accented">their</span> souls. What envier of their happiness in him could, then, possibly have torn them from him? This same portraiture of "Christ crucified" which he reminds the Galatians he had in those days presented to them, he also, as he tells the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20, 21</a>), had been intent on holding up before the Greeks of Achaia; while, further, he intimates to the Romans, in his Epistle to them, how eager he was to come and at Rome also hold up Christ as him whom God had set forth to be a Propitiation, through faith, by his blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-15.htm">Romans 1:15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>). Both to the Jew and to the Gentile, both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to unwise, this, emphatically <span class="accented">this</span>, was the alone and the sovereign salvation. This picturing forth of the crucified One, however, would hardly from Paul's lips concern itself much with the outward particulars of the passion; it might have been this, in a far greater degree, in St. Peter's presentment of it, who had been himself witness of those sufferings; but Paul, with his habits of thought, as we know them from his writings, who knew Christ as in the spirit rather than as in the flesh, would occupy himself more with the spiritual <span class="accented">idea</span> of the cross - its embodiment of perfect meekness and gentleness and self-sacrifice, of humility. of obedience to the Father's will, of love to all mankind, of especial care for his own, and its antagonism to the spirit of Levitical ceremonialism. "Such presentment," remarks Calvin, "as if in a picture, nay, as if actually crucified in the very midst of the hearers themselves, no eloquence, no artifice of rhetoric, can produce, unless that mighty working of the Spirit be assistant of which the apostle speaks in his two Epistles to the Corinthians (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4, 5, 13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3, 6</a>). If any, therefore, would fain duly discharge the ministry of the gospel, let them learn not so much to apply eloquence and declamation, as to likewise so pierce into men's consciences that these may truly <span class="accented">feet</span> Christ crucified and the dropping upon them of his blood. Where the Church hath painters such as these, she very little needeth any more representations in wood and stone, that is, dead images, very little any paintings; and certainly among Christians the doors of the temples were not open for the reception of images and paintings until the shepherds either had grown dumb and become mere dolls, or else did say in the pulpit no more than just a few words, and these in so cold and perfunctory a manner that the power and efficacy of the gospel ministry was utterly extinct." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Foolish (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25</a>.
