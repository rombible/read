It was a sort of measure of police. Its object was to deal with transgressions. It was also a temporary measure, of force only until it should be superseded by the coming of the Messiah. Unlike the promise, too, it was a contract. It was given by a mediator—that is, a person acting between two parties. Two parties were involved, with rigid conditions binding them both. On the other hand, the promise was given unconditionally by the sole act of God.<p>In stating the true function of the Law, the Apostle brings out its inferiority to the promise in four respects. (1) It dealt with sins, not with holiness; (2) it was temporary and transitory; (3) it was given, not directly, but indirectly, through the double mediation of the angels and of Moses; (4) it was conditional, and not like the promise, unconditional. It depended upon the fallible action of man, and not only upon the infallible word of God.<p>(19) <span class= "bld">Wherefore then serveth the law?</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">What then is the Law?</span> What is its object or function? If it did not affect the promise, what did it do? The Apostle proceeds to answer this question.<p><span class= "bld">It was added.</span>—It was not a part of the original scheme, but came in as a sort of marginal addition. It was, as it were, a parenthesis in the design of Providence. The direct line of God’s dealings with man ran through the promise and its fulfilment. The Law came in by the way.<p><span class= "bld">Because of transgressions.</span>—It has been usual to give to this one of two opposite interpretations, to make it mean (1) to check or put down transgressions; (2) to multiply and increase transgressions, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a>. The expression seems wide enough to cover both ideas. The Law was given “<span class= "ital">because of transgressions</span>:” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> it <span class= "ital">had its object in</span> transgressions. Its original purpose was to make them known, and by imposing a penalty to check them; its real effect was to provoke and enhance them. The expression “because of transgressions” leaves it ambiguous which of these points is meant, or rather, it includes them all.<p><span class= "bld">Till the seed should come to whom the promise was made.</span>—By “the seed” is meant, as above, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>, Christ, the Messiah. The promise is said to have <span class= "ital">been made</span> to Him in whom it is fulfilled, just as, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-14.htm" title="That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.">Galatians 3:14</a>, Christians are said to “receive the promise”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the fulfilment of the promise “of the Spirit.”<p><span class= "bld">Ordained by angels.</span>—The idea of angels having had a share in the giving of the Law appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> : “The Lord came from Sinai . . . He shined forth from mount Paran, and He came with ten thousands of saints.” For “saints” the LXX. substitutes, in the next verse, “angels.” Similar allusions are found at the end of St. Stephen’s speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>): “Who have received the law by the disposition (as ordinances) of angels, and have not kept it;” and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a> : “If the word spoken by (<span class= "ital">through</span>) angels was stedfast.” In this last instance, as in the present passage, the ministration of angels employed in it is quoted as showing the inferiority of the Law to the Gospel. In St. Stephen’s speech and in Josephus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xv. 5, 3) the same ministration is appealed to as enhancing the dignity of the Law. The different point of view is natural enough, according as the subject is regarded from the side of man or from the side of God.<p><span class= "bld">In the hand of a mediator.</span>—Through the instrumentality of a third person, distinct from the contracting parties—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in this case, Moses. The term “mediator” was commonly applied to Moses in the Rabbinical writings, and appears to be hinted at in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>, where our Lord is spoken of as “a mediator of a better covenant.” Many of the fathers, following Origen, took the mediator here to be Christ, and were thus thrown out in their interpretation of the whole passage.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Wherefore then serveth the law </span>— If the inheritance was not by the law, but by the promise, as a free gift, for what purpose was the law given, or what significancy had it? <span class="ital">It was added because of transgressions</span> — That is, to restrain the Israelites from transgressions, particularly idolatry, and the vices connected with idolatry, the evil of which the law discovered to them by its prohibitions and curse. Agreeably to this account of the law, idolatry, and all the abominations practised by the Canaanites, and the other heathen nations who surrounded the Israelites, were forbidden in the law under the severest penalties. Maimonides, a learned Jew, acknowledges, in his <span class="ital">More-Nevochim, </span>that the ceremonial law was given for the extirpation of idolatry; for, saith he, “When God sent Moses to redeem his people out of Egypt, it was the usual custom of the world, and the worship in which all nations were bred up, to build temples in honour of the sun, moon, and stars, and to offer divers kinds of animals to them, and to have priests appointed for that end. Therefore God, knowing it is beyond the strength of human nature instantly to quit that which it hath been long accustomed to, and so is powerfully inclined to, would not command that all that kind of worship should be abolished, and that he should be worshipped only in spirit; but required that he only should be the object of this outward worship; that temples and altars should be built to him alone; sacrifices offered to him only, and priests consecrated to his service.” So Cedrenus, of their festivals, separations, purgations, oblations, &c., observing, God enjoined them, <span class="ital">that, being employed in doing these things to the true God, they might abstain from idolatry. </span>And thus, saith Dr. Spencer, were they kept under the discipline of the law, and shut up from the idolatrous rites and customs of the heathen world, by the strictness of these legal observances, and the penalties denounced against the violators of them. “And it is well-known,” says Whitby, “that all the ancient fathers were of this opinion, that God gave the Jews only the decalogue, till they had made the golden calf; and that afterward he laid this yoke of ceremonies upon them to restrain them from idolatry, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-7.htm" title="Then said I to them, Cast you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.">Ezekiel 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-11.htm" title="And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.">Ezekiel 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/20-24.htm" title="Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols....">Ezekiel 20:24-25</a>,) called by the apostle <span class="ital">the law of carnal commandments, </span>which he says, was abolished for the weakness and unprofitableness of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-16.htm" title="Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.">Hebrews 7:16</a>. Hence these ceremonies were called by St. Paul, <span class="greekheb">στοιχεια του κοσμου</span>, <span class="ital">the rudiments of the world, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>; namely, because for matter they were the same which the heathen used before to their false gods. But this ancient exposition, though partly true, does not contain the whole truth; for the apostle, in the Epistle to the Romans, informs us, that <span class="ital">the law entered that sin might abound; </span>that is, might appear to abound, unto death, that <span class="ital">sin might appear sin, working death in, us, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm" title="Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.">Romans 7:13</a>. And that <span class="ital">the law worketh wrath, </span>namely, by giving us the knowledge of that sin which deserves it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm" title="Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.">Romans 4:15</a>. And this answers to what the apostle here saith, <span class="ital">that the law was added because of transgressions, </span>namely, to discover them, and the punishment due to them. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-22.htm" title="But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.">Galatians 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm" title="Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.">Galatians 3:24</a>. So also Macknight: “The law was added after the promise, to show the Israelites what things were offensive to God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>. Also, that by the manner in which it was given, becoming sensible of their transgressions, and of God’s displeasure with them for their transgressions, and of the punishment to which they were liable, they might be constrained to have recourse to the covenant with Abraham, in which justification was promised through faith, as it is now promised in the gospel. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>.” <span class="ital">Till the seed should come </span>— That illustrious seed, the Messiah; to <span class="ital">whom the promise was made </span>— “It was not fit that the law of Moses, which condemned every sinner to death, should continue any longer than till the seed should come to whom it was promised that in him <span class="ital">all nations should be blessed, </span>by having their faith counted for righteousness. For Christ having come, and published in his gospel God’s gracious intention of justifying believers of all nations by faith, if the law of Moses, which condemned every sinner to death without mercy, had been allowed to remain, it would have contradicted the gospel, and have made the promise of no effect. It was, therefore, abrogated with great propriety at the death of Christ; especially as the gospel was a dispensation of religion more effectual than the law for destroying idolatry, and restraining transgression.” <span class="ital">And was ordained </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">διαταγεις</span>, <span class="ital">appointed, promulgated, </span>or <span class="ital">spoken, </span>as it is expressed <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>. This is affirmed likewise by Stephen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm" title="This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>. <span class="ital">In the hand of a mediator</span> — Namely, Moses, then appointed by God to act the part of a mediator between him and the people of Israel. The law was not given to Israel, as the promise was to Abraham, immediately from God himself, but was conveyed by the ministry of angels to Moses, and delivered into his hand as a mediator between God and them, and as a type of the great Mediator.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:19-22 If that promise was enough for salvation, wherefore then serveth the law? The Israelites, though chosen to be God's peculiar people, were sinners as well as others. The law was not intended to discover a way of justification, different from that made known by the promise, but to lead men to see their need of the promise, by showing the sinfulness of sin, and to point to Christ, through whom alone they could be pardoned and justified. The promise was given by God himself; the law was given by the ministry of angels, and the hand of a mediator, even Moses. Hence the law could not be designed to set aside the promise. A mediator, as the very term signifies, is a friend that comes between two parties, and is not to act merely with and for one of them. The great design of the law was, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to those that believe; that, being convinced of their guilt, and the insufficiency of the law to effect a righteousness for them, they might be persuaded to believe on Christ, and so obtain the benefit of the promise. And it is not possible that the holy, just, and good law of God, the standard of duty to all, should be contrary to the gospel of Christ. It tends every way to promote it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wherefore then serveth the law? - This is obviously an objection which might be urged to the reasoning which the apostle had pursued. It was very obvious to ask, if the principles which he had laid down were correct, of what use was the Law? Why was it given at all? Why were there so many wonderful exhibitions of the divine power at its promulgation? Why were there so many commendations of it in the Scriptures? And why were there so many injunctions to obey it? Are all these to be regarded as nothing; and is the Law to be esteemed as worthless? To all this, the apostle replies that the Law was not useless, but that it was given by God for great and important purposes, and especially for purposes closely connected with the fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham and the work of the Mediator.<p>It was added - (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;  prosetethe&#772;). It was appended to all the previous institutions and promises. It was an additional arrangement on the part of God for great and important purposes. It was an arrangement subsequent to the giving of the promise, and was intended to secure important advantages until the superior arrangement under the Messiah should be introduced, and was with reference to that.<p>Because of transgressions - On account of transgressions, or with reference to them. The meaning is, that the Law was given to show the true nature of transgressions, or to show what was sin. It was not to reveal a way of justification, but it was to disclose the true nature of sin; to deter people from committing it; to declare its penalty; to convince people of it, and thus to be "ancillary" to, and preparatory to the work of redemption through the Redeemer. This is the true account of the Law of God as given to apostate man, and this use of the Law still exists. This effect of the Law is accomplished:<p>(1) By showing us what God requires, and what is duty. It is the straight rule of what is right; and to depart from that is the measure of wrong.<p>(2) it shows us the nature and extent of transgression by showing us how far we have departed from it.<p>(3) it shows what is the just penalty of transgression, and is thus suited to reveal its true nature.<p>(4) it is suited to produce conviction for sin, and thus shows how evil and bitter a thing transgression is; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-11</a>.<p>(5) it thus shows its own inability to justify and save people, and is a preparatory arrangement to lead people to the cross of the Redeemer; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>. At the same time,<p>(6) The Law was given with reference to transgressions in order to keep men from transgression. It was designed to restrain and control them by its denunciations, and by the fear of its threatened penalties.<p>When Paul says that the Law was given on account of transgressions, we are not to suppose that this was the sole use of the Law; but that this was a main or leading purpose. It may accomplish many other important purposes (Calvin), but this is one leading design. And this design it still accomplishes. It shows people their duty. It reminds them of their guilt. It teaches them how far they have wandered from God. It reveals to them the penalty of disobedience. It shows them that justification by the Law is impossible, and that there must be some other way by which people must be saved. And since these advantages are derived from it, it is of importance that that Law should be still proclaimed, and that its high demands and its penalties should be constantly held up to the view of people.<p>Till the seed should come ... - The Messiah, to whom the promise particularly applied; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>. It is not implied here that the Law would be of no use after that; but that it would accomplish important purposes before that. A large portion of the laws of Moses would then indeed cease to be binding. They were given to accomplish important purposes among the Jews until the Messiah should come, and then they would give way to the more important institutions of the gospel. But the moral law would continue to accomplish valuable objects after his advent, in showing people the nature of transgression and leading them to the cross of Christ. The essential idea of Paul here is, that the whole arrangement of the Mosaic economy, including all his laws, was with reference to the Messiah. It was a part of a great and glorious whole. It was not an independent thing. It did not stand by itself. It was incomplete and in many respects unintelligible until he came - as one part of a tally is unmeaning and useless until the other is found. In itself it did not justify or save people, but it served to introduce a system by which they could be saved. It contained no provisions for justifying people, but it was in the design of God an essential part of a system by which they could be saved. It was not a whole in itself, but it was a part of a glorious whole, and led to the completion and fulfillment of the entire scheme by which the race could be justified and brought to heaven.<p>And it was ordained by angels - That is, the Law was ordained by angels. The word ordained here &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2;  diatageis usually means to arrange; to dispose in order; and is commonly used with reference to the marshalling of an army. In regard to the sentiment here that the Law was ordained by angels, see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>. The Old Testament makes no mention of the presence of angels at the giving of the Law, but it was a common opinion among the Jews that the Law was given by the instrumentality of angels, and arranged by them; and Paul speaks in accordance with this opinion; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>. The sentiment here is that the Law was prescribed, ordered, or arranged by the instrumentality of the angels; an opinion, certainly, which none can prove not to be true. In itself considered, there is no more absurdity in the opinion that the Law of God should be given by the agency of angels, than there is that it should be done by the instrumentality of man.<p>In the Septuagint <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> there is an allusion of the same kind. The Hebrew is: "From his right hand went a fiery law for them." The Septuagint renders this, "His angels with him on his right hand;" compare Josephus, Ant. xv. 5, 3. That angels were present at the giving of the Law is more than implied, it is believed, in two passages of the Old Testament. The one is that which is referred to above, and a part of which the translators of the Septuagint expressly apply to angels; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>. The Hebrew is, "Yahweh came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from Mount Paron, and he came (literally) with ten thousands of holiness;" that is, with his holy ten thousands, or with his holy myriads &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1489;&#1514; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;  me&#772;ribbot qodesh. By the holy myriads mentioned here what can be meant but "the angels"? The word "holy" in the Scriptures is not given to storms and winds and tempests; and the natural interpretation is, that he was attended with vast hosts of intelligent beings.<p>The same sentiment is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a> - "The chariots of God are myriads, thousands repeated; the Lord is in the midst of them, as in Sinai, as in his sanctuary." Does not this evidently imply that when he gave the Law on Mount Sinai he was surrounded by a multitude of angels? see Stuart on the Hebrews, Excursus viii. pp. 565-567. It may be added, that in the fact itself there is no improbability. What is more natural than to suppose that when the Law of God was promulgated in such a solemn manner on Mount Sinai to a world, that the angels should be present? If any occasion on earth has ever occurred where their presence was allowable and proper, assuredly that was one. And yet the Scriptures abound with assurances that the angels are interested in human affairs, and that they have had an important agency in the concerns of man.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. "Wherefore then serveth the law?" as it is of no avail for justification, is it either useless, or contrary to the covenant of God? [Calvin].<p>added&#8212;to the original covenant of promise. This is not inconsistent with Ga 3:15, "No man addeth thereto"; for there the kind of addition meant, and therefore denied, is one that would add new conditions, inconsistent with the grace of the covenant of promise. The law, though misunderstood by the Judaizers as doing so, was really added for a different purpose, namely, "because of (or as the Greek, 'for the sake of') the transgressions," that is, to bring out into clearer view the transgressions of it (Ro 7:7-9); to make men more fully conscious of their "sins," by being perceived as transgressions of the law, and so to make them long for the promised Saviour. This accords with Ga 3:23, 24; Ro 4:15. The meaning can hardly be "to check transgressions," for the law rather stimulates the corrupt heart to disobey it (Ro 5:20; 7:13).<p>till the seed&#8212;during the period up to the time when the seed came.

He reserved "the promise" to Himself and dispensed it according to His own goodness.<p>in the hand of a mediator&#8212;namely, Moses. De 5:5, "I stood between the Lord and you": the very definition of a mediator. Hence the phrase often recurs, "By the hand of Moses."

If this be the case, might an objector say, why was the law given? what ends and purposes are to be served by it? of what use can it be? there had as good been no law at all, if the inheritance is not of it, and there is no justification by it. To which it is answered, <p>it was added because of transgressions; four hundred and thirty years after the covenant made with Abraham; it did not succeed it, nor take the place of it, and so make it null and void; but was over and above added unto it, for the sake of restraining transgressions; which had there been no law, men would not have been accountable for them; and they would have gone into them without fear, and with impunity; but the law was given, to lay a restraint on men, by forbidding such and such things, on pain of death; and also for the detecting, discovering, and making known transgressions, what they are, their nature and consequences; these the law charges men with, sets them before them, in their true light and proper colours; and convicts them of them, stops their mouths, and pronounces them guilty before God: moreover, this law entered in, over and above any other revelation God was pleased to make, "that the offence might abound", <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a> either that particular offence, the sin of Adam, the apostle is there speaking of; the heinous nature of which, its aggravated circumstances, and the justness of its imputation to his posterity, were more clearly discerned by this law; and so the Syriac version here renders it in the singular number, <p>, "because of transgression"; or all other offences and transgressions, which are increased through the multiplicity of precepts, and attended with more aggravating circumstances, than if no law was given, and more eagerly pursued after, through the prohibition of them; such being the corrupt nature of man, that the more anything is forbidden, the more desirous it is of it: add to all this, that the law was given for the punishing of transgressions, for which it curses, and threatens with death, and inflicts it on Christless sinners: hence it is clear there can be no justification by it, and yet it is not useless and insignificant: <p>till the seed should come, to whom the promise was made; either Christ the seed of the woman, and of Abraham, who was to come in the flesh, and is come; and to whom the grand promise of life, and all the promises of the covenant were made; not for himself, but for those he represented, and in whom they are all secure: until whose coming to finish transgression, and bring in everlasting righteousness, the law was to continue in the form in which, and the use for which it was added, and then to cease as the ministration of Moses; for through the coming of Christ it received its full accomplishment, and came to an end; the ceremonial law was utterly abolished, and the moral law ceased to be a covenant of works, though it continues a rule of walk and conversation; and the whole Mosaic economy was no more: or else the seed here intends the spiritual seed of Abraham; particularly among the Gentiles, to whom the promise of blessedness, of justification, and eternal life was made; and the sense be, that till such time that a generation of faithful men, of believers in Christ, should arise among the Gentiles, the law was to continue with the Jews; but when they should spring up, the middle wall of partition should be broken down, and Abraham's spiritual seed among Jews and Gentiles make up one body, one people, and be fellow heirs and partakers of the promise of God in Christ, through the Gospel: <p>and it was ordained by angels; not Moses and Aaron, and Joshua, as some say; for though Moses was concerned in the giving of the law, yet not Aaron nor Joshua, nor are any of them ever called angels; but the holy elect angels are here meant, the ten thousands of saints, or holy ones, God came to Mount Sinai with, and the Lord was among, in the holy place; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> and so the Jews say (l) that the Lord appeared on Mount Sinai gloriously,  , "with companies", or "troops of angels", to give the law to his people: and this may be said to be "ordained" by them, inasmuch as it might be written and spoken by them, as the instruments and ministers God made use of; for though the tables are said to be the work of God, and the writing the writing of God, and to be written with the finger of God, and he is said to speak all the words of it, yet this hinders not, but that all this might be done by the means of angels; who might be employed in disposing and fitting the stones in the form they were, and in writing the law upon them; hence it is said to be given by the disposition of angels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a> and certain it is, that it was spoken by them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a> they forming in the air those articulate and audible sounds, when the law was delivered; who were also concerned in the thunderings and lightnings, and in the blowing of the trumpet, that waxed louder and louder at that time: <p>in the hand of a mediator; not Christ, as many interpreters, ancient and modern, have thought; for though he was present at the giving of the law, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a> and is the Mediator between God and man, and had the law in his hand, out of which it went forth as the lawgiver; and as the surety of his people has fulfilled it, and by so doing put an end to it, and delivered them from the curse and condemnation of it; yet he is the Mediator of the new and better covenant, not the ministration of death, but of life; and so Moses and Christ, the law and Gospel, the old and the new covenant, are continually opposed to each other; besides, the mediator here seems to be represented as inferior to the angels, and as receiving the law into his hands from them, by whom it was ordained; which to conceive of Christ, is very much to the demeaning and lessening of him. Moses is the mediator here meant, who stood between God and the people of Israel; not to make peace between them, but to show the word of God from him to them, and this at their own request; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>, and in his hand the tables of the law were, when he came down from the mount, and was a typical mediator of Christ. So the Jews say of him, that <p>"he was  "a mediator" between them and God (m).'' <p>(l) Targum in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29.htm">1 Chronicles 29</a>.11.

In order, the apostle says, to reprove men of sin, and so to teach them to look to Christ, in whom at length that promise of saving all people together should be fulfilled; the Law was not given in order to justify men.<p>(o) That men might understand by discovering their sins that they are only saved by the grace of God, which he revealed to Abraham, and that in Christ.<p>(p) Until the partition wall was broken down, and that full seed sprang up, made of two peoples, both of Jews and Gentiles. For by this word seed we may not understand Christ alone by himself, but coupled and joined together with his body.<p>(23) A confirmation of the former answer taken from the manner and form of giving the Law: for it was given by angels, striking a great terror into all, and by Moses a mediator coming between. Now they that are one need no mediator, but they that are in any way separated, and that are at variance one with another, do. Therefore the Law itself and the mediator were witnesses of the wrath of God, and not that God would by this means reconcile men to himself and abolish the promise, or add the Law to the promise.<p>(q) Commanded and given, or proclaimed.<p>(r) By the service and ministry.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/galatians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law?

No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7</a> ff.); but sin—which, although existing since Adam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-13.htm" title="(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.">Romans 5:13</a>), is yet increased by that provocation of the law—has only come to assume the definite character of <span class="greekheb">παράβασις</span> in virtue of the existence of the law and its relation thereto (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm" title="Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.">Romans 4:15</a>). The same purpose of the law is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a>, but without the stricter definition of sin as <span class="greekheb">παράβασις</span>. Accordingly, <span class="greekheb">τῶν παραβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span> is not (with Wetstein) to be rationalized to this effect: “Lex sine dubio eo consilio lata est, ut servaretur, <span class="greekheb">ὑπακοῆς χάριν</span>; vitio tamen hominum evenit, ut peccata multiplicarentur.” This is in itself correct (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.">Romans 7:12</a>), but is irrelevant here, where the point in question is the position of the law in connection with the divine plan of salvation, the final aim of which is redemption. The real idea of the apostle is, that the emergence of sins—namely, in the penal, wrath-deserving (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm" title="Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.">Romans 4:15</a>), moral form of <span class="ital">transgressions</span>—which the law brought about, was <span class="ital">designed</span> by God (who must indeed have foreseen this effect) when He gave the law, and designed in fact as a mediate end in reference to the future redemption; for the evil was to become truly great, that it might nevertheless be outdone by grace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a>). The result, which the law, according to experience, has on the whole effected, and by which it has proved itself the <span class="greekheb">δύναμις τῆς ἁμαρτίας</span> (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>), could not be otherwise than the <span class="ital">aim</span> of God. Comp. Ritschl, p. 74 f.; Baur, <span class="ital">neutest. Theol</span>. p. 140 f.; Hilgenfeld, Wieseler, Holsten, Hofmann, Reithmayr, Matthias (who, however, assumes the intentional appearance of an ambiguity), Stölting, and others; also Lipsius, <span class="ital">Rechtfertigungsl</span>. p. 75; Lechler, <span class="ital">apost. Zeit</span>. p. 110. Luther (1519) strikingly remarks: “Ut remissio propter salutem, ita praevaricatio propter remissionem, ita lex propter transgressionem.” Observe, further, the <span class="ital">article</span> before <span class="greekheb">παραβ</span>., which summarily comprehends, as having really that character, the transgressions arising and existing since the giving of the law; comp. Holsten, <span class="ital">z. Ev. d. Paul, u. Petr</span>. p. 297. Others[141] consider that by <span class="greekheb">τῶν παραβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span> <span class="ital">the recognition of sins</span> is expressed as the aim of the law. So Augustine, Calvin, Beza, Piscator, Calovius, Wolf, Schoettgen, Michaelis, Windischmann, and others; also Winer (“ut manifestam redderet atque ita argueret illam, quam Judaei peccando sibi contrahebant, culpam”). But (1) this idea could not have been expressed by the mere <span class="greekheb">τῶν παραβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span>; for although <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span> is not always exclusively used in its original sense, <span class="ital">for the sake of, in favour of</span>, but may also be taken simply as <span class="ital">on account of</span>,[142] still, in order to be intelligible, Paul must have written <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐπιγνώσεως τῶν παραβάσεων χάριν</span> as signifying: in order to bring sins to recognition <span class="ital">as transgressions</span>. And (2) the point of the <span class="ital">recognition</span> of sin was entirely foreign to this passage; for in <span class="greekheb">τῶν παραβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span> Paul desires to call attention to the fact that the law, according to the divine plan, was intended to produce exactly the objective, actual (not merely the subjective) opposite of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΚΑΙΟΣΎΝΗ</span></span></span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law....">Galatians 3:21-22</a>). On account of this connection also the interpretation of many expositors, <span class="ital">ad coercendas transgressiones</span>, is wholly to be rejected, because opposed to the context. So Jerome, Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Grotius, Zachariae, Semler, Morus, Koppe, Rosenmüller, Paulus, Rückert, Olshausen, Neander, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette, Baur, Ewald (“in order <span class="ital">to punish</span> them <span class="ital">more strictly</span>”); also Messner, <span class="ital">Lehre d. Ap</span>. p. 222, and Hauck, comp. Buhl; several, such as Grotius and Rückert, think that the inclination to Egyptian idolatry is chiefly referred to. This view is decidedly disposed of by the expression <span class="greekheb">παραβάσεων</span>, since <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΡΑΒΆΣΕΙς</span></span></span> as such could only come into existence <span class="ital">with</span> the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm" title="Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.">Romans 4:15</a>); previously there were sins, but no transgressions,—a view with which <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-14.htm" title="Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.">Romans 5:14</a> does not conflict, because the matter in question there is the transgression of a quite definite, positive command of God. <span class="ital">The two</span> last interpretations are <span class="ital">combined</span> by Flatt and Schott, as also by Reiche, following older expositors (comp. also Matthies),—a course inconsistent with hermeneutical principles in general, and here in fact involving an amalgamation of <span class="ital">two erroneous views</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">προσετέθη</span>] <span class="ital">it was added</span>, is not inconsistent with what was said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-15.htm" title="Brothers, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man cancels, or adds thereto.">Galatians 3:15</a>, <span class="greekheb">οὐδεὶς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐπιδιατάσσεται</span>, because in the latter general proposition under <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΔΕΊς</span></span></span> <span class="ital">third</span> persons are thought of.

As to the use of the aorist participle in the language of narration, see Hermann, <span class="ital">ad Viger</span>. p. 774; Bernhardy, p. 383. The tradition that the divine promulgation of the law took place amidst the <span class="ital">ministry of angels</span>, is first found in the LXX., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> (not in the original text); then in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm" title="This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>, Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt</span>. xv. 5. 3, and in the Rabbins, and also in the Samaritan theology.

It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator....">Galatians 3:19-22</a>. THE LAW WAS A TEMPORARY ENACTMENT ORDAINED TO DEAL WITH THE OFFENCES WHICH IT DENOUNCES UNTIL THE COMING OF THE PROMISED SEED. THE GOD FROM WHOM IT PROCEEDED WAS THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, BUT HE PROMULGATED IT THROUGH ANGELS AND AN APPOINTED MEDIATOR TO ALL THE CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM AFTER THE FLESH, NOT TO THE ONE CHOSEN SEED. DID IT THEN CONTRAVENE HIS PROMISES? NAY VERILY. IF INDEED IT HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF QUICKENING LIFE, IT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED NEW MEANS OF JUSTIFICATION: BUT WHAT IT REALLY DID WAS TO CONVICT ALL ALIKE OF SIN, THAT THE PROMISE MIGHT BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE ON FAITH IN CHRIST.—<span class="greekheb">Τί οὖν ὁ νόμος</span>. What function then had the Law, if it had absolutely no effect on God’s previous covenant with Abraham?—<span class="greekheb">τῶν παραβάσεων χάριν</span>. Our versions render this <span class="ital">because of transgressions</span>, ignoring the Greek article. But there could obviously be no transgressions until the Law existed, however grievous the moral degradation. The real meaning is that it was added with a view to <span class="ital">the</span> offences which it specifies, thereby pronouncing them to be from that time forward transgressions of the Law. Its design is gathered in short from its contents. The prohibitions of the Ten Commandments reveal their own purpose: they were enacted in order to repress the worship of false gods, idolatry, blasphemy, Sabbath breaking, disobedience to parents, murder, adultery, theft, false witness, covetousness. These sins prevailed before the Law, but by pronouncing them to be definite transgressions it called in the fear of God’s wrath to reinforce the weakness of the moral sense and educate man’s conscience. The same aspect of the Law is forcibly presented in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for murderers,">1 Timothy 1:9</a>. <span class="ital">Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly</span>.… Attention is in both concentrated on the moral Law to the exclusion of the sacrificial and ceremonial.—<span class="greekheb">ἄχρις οὗ</span>. The alternative reading <span class="greekheb">ἄχρις ἄν</span> does not affect the sense. It is assumed on the strength of previous argument that the dispensation of the Law came to an end with the coming of Christ. By the gift of an indwelling spirit He emancipated His faithful disciples from allegiance to an outward Law.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπήγγελται</span>: <span class="ital">He</span> (<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, God) <span class="ital">hath promised</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-21.htm" title="And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.">Romans 4:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-26.htm" title="Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.">Hebrews 12:26</a>). <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγέλλεσθαι</span> never has a passive sense in the N.T.—<span class="greekheb">διαταγεὶς διʼ ἀγγέλων</span>. The N.T. refers three times to the interposition of angels in the promulgation of the Law: God’s intercourse with Moses through the angel of His presence was evidently a common topic in Jewish schools of theology. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a> the fact is recorded by way of enhancing the authority of the Law; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;">Hebrews 2:2</a> it is contrasted with God’s revelation in His Son: here it is contrasted with God’s more familiar intercourse with Abraham. He drew nigh to God, and <span class="ital">was called the friend of God</span>: but at Sinai the people stood far off, and the Law was made known through the double intervention of angels and of a human mediator.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν χειρὶ μεσίτου</span>. The term <span class="greekheb">μεσίτης</span> was applied with the utmost latitude to any intermediate between two parties, whether it was the one great Mediator between God and man or any of the subordinate servants of God through whom He makes known His will to men or exercises His authority. The phrase <span class="greekheb">ἐν χειρί</span> defines its meaning here, for it implies that Moses was put in charge of the promulgation of the Law (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-28.htm" title="This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.">Numbers 4:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-37.htm" title="These were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.">Numbers 4:37</a> in LXX), and was God’s appointed agent for the purpose. This interposition of a mediator between God and the people was a marked feature of distinction between the Sinaitic and the patriarchal dispensation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19–29</span>. The Purpose and Use of the Law in relation to the Justification of the Sinner<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">19</span>. If then the promise is not affected by the law, so that no new condition of justification is imposed by it, the question naturally arises, ‘Why was the law given?’ To this the Apostle has an answer ready. It was not given to limit, much less to supersede the promise. The promise and the law are like two circles, which touch, but do not intersect each other: each perfect of its kind, because both alike Divine in their origin. But in answering the question which he has anticipated, St Paul shews the inferiority of the law in several particulars to the earlier and ‘better covenant’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>). (1) The law condemns: it cannot give life, because no man can fulfil its conditions. It provokes transgression, convinces of sin, and denounces punishment. (2) It was superadded as a parenthetical and temporary dispensation, commencing with the national life of the Jewish people, and terminating with the Advent of the Seed to whom the promise was given. (3) It was not delivered immediately, like the promises to Abraham, but mediately by Moses in the presence of Angels as attesting witnesses. (4) It was a contract between God and man, life depending on the fulfilment of its terms, and was therefore conditional, and not absolute like the promise.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">it was added</span>] Yet not so as to interfere with the promise. If any one man had succeeded in rendering perfect obedience to the law, he would have been justified, no less than they to whom the righteousness of Another was imputed by faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because of transgressions</span>] Dismissing the explanations, ‘to check’ or ‘to punish’ transgressions, we may make St Paul his own interpreter. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm" title="Moreover the law entered, that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:">Romans 5:20</a> he says that the law ‘intervened that the offence might abound’; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm" title="Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.">Romans 7:13</a>, that the commandment was given in order that sin ‘might be shewn to be sin … that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.’ Nay, he testifies that himself had not known sin ‘except through the law’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.">Romans 7:7</a>), for ‘through the law is the knowledge of sin’. And yet further, ‘the strength of sin is the law’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-56.htm" title="The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>). From a comparison of these and other passages we infer that the purpose for which the law was given was not on the one hand the restraint or punishment of sin, nor on the other the increase of evil in the world. The evil existed already and was active. But its real nature, <span class="ital">as an offence against God</span>, rebellion against His authority, was not felt until that authority was expressed in the form of command and prohibition, that is, of <span class="ital">law</span>. The barrier which obstructs the force of the stream does not add to its force; it reveals the force by the resistance which it offers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">till the seed should come</span>] This marks the limits of its operation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the seed</span>] That is, Christ. Surely it was by no accident that the term employed in the Abrahamic covenant is the same which is used in the yet earlier gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm" title="And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; it shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.">Genesis 3:15</a>). The seed of Abraham is the seed of the woman.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to whom the promise was made</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">has been made</span>. The promise was not annulled by the law. It continued in force, awaiting its fulfilment. This seems to be expressed by the perfect tense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and was ordained by angels</span>] ‘having been enjoined, or enacted, by means of angels’. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> we read, R.V. ‘The Lord came from Sinai, And rose from Seir unto them; He shined forth from Mount Paran, And He came from the ten thousands of holy ones: At His right hand was a fiery law unto them.’ The expression, ‘with ten thousands of His saints’ is, literally, ‘from (amidst) myriads of holiness’, or ‘holy myriads.’ The R.V. ‘the ten thousands of holy ones’ is not a literal rendering, but a paraphrase denoting the angels; and though the LXX. render the clause, ‘with myriads of Kades’, they add (apparently from a different Hebrew text), ‘on His right angels (were) with Him’. The older versions and ‘expositors generally agree in the common rendering’. Lightfoot. That angels were present as attesting witnesses at the giving of the law was a common opinion among the Rabbinic teachers, and allusion is made to it not only by St Paul in this passage, but by St Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>), by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>), and by Josephus (<span class="ital">Antt</span>. xv. 5. 3). Regarded as the retinue of the Supreme Lawgiver, the angels by their presence added solemnity to the occasion. But that very presence emphasized the fact that the law was of the nature of a contract, conditional, not absolute, a transaction between two parties, not the spontaneous revelation of mercy by Him who ‘is One’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the hand of</span>] A Hebraism nearly equivalent to, ‘by means of’ or simply ‘by’. It is so used frequently in the O.T., e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-37.htm" title="These were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.">Numbers 4:37</a>, when Moses and Aaron are said to have numbered the people ‘according to the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses[27]’. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-35.htm" title="This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.">Acts 7:35</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[27] The LXX. translates, ‘by the voice of the Lord in the hand of Moses.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a mediator</span>] The noun thus rendered occurs in four other passages of the N. T. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm" title="For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm" title="But now has he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises.">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm" title="And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.">Hebrews 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>), and in all of them refers to our Lord Jesus Christ. In the three latter He is expressly termed the Mediator of the new or better covenant. <span class="ital">Here</span> the mediator is associated with the first covenant. In the epistle to Timothy our Lord is a mediator ‘between God and <span class="ital">man</span>’. Here the mediator is between God and the people of Israel, i.e. of course, Moses. These considerations, together with a due regard to the general scope of the passage, lead to the rejection of the view that in this passage the Mediator is our Lord—indeed such a view may astonish us, though supported by such eminent names as Origen, Jerome, Augustine, and Chrysostom. Neither the noun nor the corresponding verb (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-17.htm" title="Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:">Hebrews 6:17</a>) is found in the LXX., though its reference to Moses in the passage before us is confirmed by his own declaration, ‘The Lord our God made a covenant with you in Horeb.… I stood between the Lord and you at that time to shew you the word of the Lord’, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-2.htm" title="The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.">Deuteronomy 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm" title="(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for you were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>.

Here it intimates that the Law was given from a regard to men's sinful actions, with an implied contrast with the covenant of Christ's gospel, which was concerned with men's justification and benediction. The province of the Law is to expose sins, rebuke them, pronounce God's curse upon them, coerce and restrain them by the discipline of a system of outward rites and ceremonies. The office of the Law, as dealing with sinners as continuing sinful, while unable to make them new creatures, is indicated by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>, where, after saying, "The Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners," he proceeds to add a catalogue of offenders chargeable with the grossest form of criminality; which furnishes a most apt illustration of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("transgressions") which he here uses, and which marks sins in their most wilful and most condemnable character. What was spiritually the outcome of the Law's action upon men's sinful nature, in making their "sin exceeding sinful," the apostle has vividly portrayed in the seventh chapter of the Romans. This last point, however, is probably not even glanced at here; and it is only by straining the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, that some commentators, notably Meyer, find the apostle to be here stating that the Law was added for the behoof of transgressions, as it were in their interest, to increase and intensify them, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>, that the trespass might abound. This, however, is not naturally found in the present passage. All that the apostle here states is that the Law merely dealt with sins, having no function in relation to life and righteousness. The article before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> indicates the whole class of objects referred to, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). This" superadded" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) is not inconsistent with the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "nor addeth thereto," of ver. 15; inasmuch as it points to a Divine ordinance, which stood, so to speak, in a different plane from the covenant of grace, and in no way interfered with it. <span class="cmt_word">Till the</span> <span class="cmt_word">seed should come</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The form of expression indicates the purpose of him who arranged it all, that the Law should last only so long, and was to come to an end when the seed came. <span class="cmt_word">To whom the promise</span> <span class="cmt_word">was made</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">to whom the promise hath been made.</span> The perfect tense of the verb, as in the case of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in ver. 18, points to the still continuing validity of the promise. The "seed" is "Christ;" the historical Christ, indeed, but still viewed collectively as summing up in himself all who should be united to him. <span class="cmt_word">And it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">being ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span> The verb "ordain" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), being most commonly used for "command," "order," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-55.htm">Luke 8:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-17.htm">1 Corinthians 7:17</a>, is introduced in preference to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. ver. 20 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-19.htm">John 7:19</a>), as making more prominent the notion of <span class="accented">imperative</span> action on the part of the Divine Lawgiver. The whole passage is tinctured with the feeling that the giving of the Law, as contrasted with the dispensation of the Messiah, was marked by distance, sternness, alienation. This is the meaning of the mention of "angels" as the medium of communication on the side of Heaven, and of "a mediator" as the selected medium of reception on the side of Israel (compare the contrast between the two dispensations in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>). This representation of the Law as given through angels is unmistakably made again in the Epistle to the Hebrews, in the words, "The word spoken through angels" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>), where also it is placed in the same contrast with the gospel as spoken by the Lord Jesus, which here is plainly <span class="accented">implied</span>, if indeed it is not expressly alluded to, in the enigmatic words, "but God is one," in the next verse. This view of the Law as communicated through the medium of angels is distinctly referred to by St. Stephen as the accepted belief of the Jewish theologians before whom he spoke: "Ye who received the Law as the ordinances of angels" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>), where the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, forms a remarkable parallel to the words, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, now before us. The same view is put forth by Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:05, 3), "We having learned the most excellent of our doctrines and the most holy part of our Law through angels from God." Such, then, was incontestably the current belief of the Jewish people, both Christian and non-Christian. The Hebrew theologians directed a great deal of attention upon the doctrine of angels, of which the "boundless genealogies" spoken of by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>) was certainly one diseased branch. We may without improbability suppose that their exegetical sagacity, not unaided by the  Spirit of God promised by him to his people upon their restoration from Captivity, detected the particular fact here indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16, 19</a>. The countless hosts of his "saints" who attended upon the Lord on that occasion were not surely mere spectators; and to their intervention acting out the volitions of God might be most reasonably ascribed all the physical sights and sounds which gave to the giving of the Law its sensible awfulness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). "They raised the fire and smoke; they shook and rent the rock; they framed the sound of the trumpet; they effected the articulate voices which conveyed the words of the Law to the ears of the people, and therein proclaimed and published the Law; whereby it became ' the word spoken by angels'" (Owen, 'Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews,' 2:2). <span class="cmt_word">In the hand of a mediator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">by the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, in or by the hand, is unquestionably a Hebraism, being in the Septuagint the ordinary literal rendering of the Hebrew <span class="accented">beyad</span>; see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-37.htm">Numbers 4:37, 45</a>; which passages likewise show us whom the apostle means to designate as the mediator; in reference to which comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>, "I stood between (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) the Lord and you at that time [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the giving of the Law], to show you the word of the Lord." So Philo ('Vit. Mos.,' 678) speaks of Hoses as acting like a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "mediator and reconciler." Schottgen ('Hor. Hebr.') gives numerous examples from the rabbinical books of this application of the term "mediator "to Moses. This conception of Moses as a mediator seems <span class="accented">implied</span> also in the words, "Mediator of a better covenant" and "Mediator of a new covenant," which we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a> and Hebrews 12:24, with reference to Christ. Evidently the mention of a mediator in the present passage is intended to point to the relations between the Lord and Israel as being those of distance and estrangement. If it be objected that the same inference would be deducible from the description of Christ as "Mediator between God and men," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, we have it to say, in answer, that Christ, being in his nature both God and man, not only mediates between God and men, having made atonement or reconciliation by his cross, but in his own being unites God and man, abolishing actually that state of mutual alienation which the mediation of Moses by figure implied but could not in reality do away. We, too, were enemies to God before we were reconciled by the death of his Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>); but now, being reconciled, we are at one with God in Christ: Christ's life in our nature both guaranteeing and effectuating our continued state of reconciliation with the Father as well as our own spiritual and eternal life. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Wherefore then serveth the law?

Not, in order to give the knowledge of sins. This, it is true, would follow the revelation of sins as transgressions of law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a>); but, 1. the phrase because of transgressions does not express that thought with sufficient definiteness. If that had been his meaning, Paul would probably have written &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; on account of the knowledge of transgressions. 2. He meant to describe the office of the law as more than giving the knowledge of sins. Its office was, in revealing sin as positive transgression, to emphasize the objective, actual, contrary fact of righteousness according to the divine ideal, and to throw sin into contrast with that grand ideal.<p>The seed<p>Christ, whose advent was to introduce the fulfillment of the promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<p>Ordained (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>The verb means to arrange, appoint, prescribe.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>. In the later rabbinical schools great importance was attached to this tradition, and it was not without influence in shaping the doctrine of angelic mediation which formed one of the elements of the Colossian heresy. Josephus (Ant. 15:5, 3) relates that Herod excited the Jews to battle by a speech, in which he said that they had learned the holiest of laws from God through angels. It is a general O.T. idea that in great theophanies God appears surrounded with a heavenly host. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-11.htm">Joel 3:11</a>. The idea of an angelic administration is also familiar. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm">Exodus 32:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>.

It is a later Greek word signifying also umpire, arbitrator, and appears in lxx only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-33.htm">Job 9:33</a>. The mediator here is Moses, who is often so designated by rabbinical writers. The object is not (as Meyer) to enable the reader to realize the glory of the law in the dignity and formal solemnity of its ordination, but to indicate the inferior, subordinate position held by the law in comparison with the promise, not the gospel. A glorification of the law cannot be intended, since if that were contemplated in the mention of angels and the mediator, the statement would tend to the disparagement of the promise which was given without a mediator. Paul, in the section <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-6.htm">Galatians 3:6-9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>, aims to show that the law does not, as the Judaisers assume, stand in a relation to the divine plan of salvation as direct and positive as does the promise, and that it has not, like the promise and its fulfillment, an eternal significance. On the contrary, it has only a transitory value. This estimate of the law does not contradict Paul's assertions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12-25</a>. In representing the law as subordinate and temporary he does not impugn it as a divine institution. </body></html>
