But where there is a contract there must be also conditions, and if these conditions are not observed the whole falls to the ground. Such was the Law. The Law was not kept, and therefore the blessings annexed to it were forfeited. On the other hand, the promise depends upon God alone. He gave it, and He will assuredly keep it, no matter what man may do. God alone is concerned in it.<p>This passage is a conspicuous instance of the advance which has been made in New Testament exegesis. It is said to have received as many as 250 or 300 (according to another estimate, even 430) interpretations, but at the present moment there is a tendency to acquiesce in that given above, which, it is hoped, will be thought satisfactory.<p><span class= "bld">Now a mediator is not a mediator of one.</span>—The very idea of a mediator involves two parties at least.

Therefore, in the affair of the promise, Moses had nothing to do: the law, wherein he was concerned, was a transaction of quite another nature. Or, as Dr. Doddridge paraphrases this difficult passage more at large, following, as he says, Mr. Locke’s interpretation, not without attentively comparing a variety of others, “A mediator is not merely the mediator of one party, but at least of two, between which he must pass, and, by the nature of his office, transact for both; but God is only one party in that covenant made with Abraham, and Abraham and his seed, including all that believe, both Jews and Gentiles, are the other. As Moses, therefore, when the law was given, stood at that time, between the Lord and Israel, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm" title="(I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to show you the word of the LORD: for you were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>,)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and did not pass between the whole collective body of Abraham’s seed and the blessed God; so nothing was transacted by him with relation to those for whom he did not appear, and consequently nothing in that covenant wherein he did mediate could disannul the promise, or affect the right accruing to any from a prior engagement, in which the Gentiles were concerned as well as the Israelites; for no covenant can be altered but by the mutual consent of both parties; and in what was done at mount Sinai by the mediation of Moses, there was none to appear for the Gentiles; so that this transaction between God and the Israelites could have no force to abrogate the promise, which extended likewise to the Gentiles, or to vacate a covenant that was made between parties of which one only was there.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:19-22 If that promise was enough for salvation, wherefore then serveth the law? The Israelites, though chosen to be God's peculiar people, were sinners as well as others. The law was not intended to discover a way of justification, different from that made known by the promise, but to lead men to see their need of the promise, by showing the sinfulness of sin, and to point to Christ, through whom alone they could be pardoned and justified. The promise was given by God himself; the law was given by the ministry of angels, and the hand of a mediator, even Moses. Hence the law could not be designed to set aside the promise. A mediator, as the very term signifies, is a friend that comes between two parties, and is not to act merely with and for one of them. The great design of the law was, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to those that believe; that, being convinced of their guilt, and the insufficiency of the law to effect a righteousness for them, they might be persuaded to believe on Christ, and so obtain the benefit of the promise. And it is not possible that the holy, just, and good law of God, the standard of duty to all, should be contrary to the gospel of Christ. It tends every way to promote it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one ... - This verse has given great perplexity to commentators. "There is, unquestionably," says Bloomfield, "no passage in the New Testament that has so much, and to so little purpose, exercised the learning and ingenuity of commentators as the present, which seems to defy all attempts to elicit any satisfactory sense, except by methods so violent as to be almost the same thing as writing the passage afresh." In regard, however, to the truth of the declarations here - that "a mediator is not a mediator of one," and that "God is one" - there can be no doubt, and no difficulty. The very idea of a mediator supposes that there are two parties or persons between whom the mediator comes either to reconcile them or to bear some message from the one to the other; and it is abundantly affirmed also in the Old Testament that there is but one God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>.<p>But the difficulty is, to see the pertinency or the bearing of the remark on the argument of the apostle. What does he intend to illustrate by the declaration? and how do the truths which he states, illustrate the point before him? It is not consistent with the design of these notes to detail the numerous opinions which have been entertained of the passage. They may be found in the larger commentaries, and particularly may be seen in Koppe, Excursus vii. on the Galatians. After referring to a number of works on the passage, Rosenmuller adopts the following interpretation, proposed by Noessett, as expressing the true sense. But he (that is, Moses) is not a mediator of one race (to wit, the Abrahamic), but God is the same God of them and of the Gentiles. The sense according to this is, that Moses had not reference in his office as mediator or as internuncius to the descendants of Abraham, or to that one seed or race, referred to in the promise.<p>He added the hard conditions of the Law; required its stern and severe observances; his institutions pertained to the Jews mainly. They indeed might obtain the favor of God, but by compliance with the severe laws which he had ordained. But to the one seed, the whole posterity of Abraham, they concerning whom the promise was made, the Gentiles as well as the Jews, he had no reference in his institutions: all their favors, therefore, must depend on the fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham. But God is one and the same in reference to all. His promise pertains to all. He is the common God to the Jews and the Gentiles. There is great difficulty in embracing this view of the passage, but it is not necessary for me to state the difficulty or to attempt to show that the view here proposed cannot be defended. Whitby has expressed substantially the same interpretation of this passage. "But this mediator (namely, Moses) was only the mediator of the Jews, and so was only the mediator of one party, to whom belonged the blessing of Abraham, <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-14.htm">Galatians 3:14</a>. But God, who made the promise, 'That in one should all the families of the earth be blessed,' is one; the God of the other party, the Gentiles as well as the Jews, and so as ready to justify the one as the other."<p>According to this interpretation, the sense is, that Moses was mediator of one part of Abraham's seed, the Israelites; but was not the mediator of the other part of that seed, the Gentiles; yet there was the same God to both parties, who was equally ready to justify both. Locke has expressed a view of the passage which differs somewhat from this, but which has quite as much plausibility. According to his exposition it means, that God was but one of the parties to the promise. The Jews and the Gentiles made up the other. But at the giving of the Law Moses was a mediator only between God and the Israelites, and, therefore, could not transact anything which would tend to the disannulling of the promise which was between God and the Jews and Gentiles together, the other party to the promise. Or in other words, at the covenant made on Mount Sinai, there was really present but one of the parties, and consequently nothing could be done that would affect the other.<p>Moses did not appear in behalf of the Gentiles. They had no representative there. He was engaged only for the Jews, for a part only of the one party, and that part could not transact anything for the whole. The giving of the Law, therefore, could not affect the promise which was made to Abraham, and which related to the Jews and the Gentiles as together constituting one party. This view is plausible. It has been adopted by Doddridge, and perhaps may be the true interpretation. No one can deny, however, that it is forced, and that it is far from being obvious. It seems to be making a meaning for the apostle, or furnishing him with an argument, rather than explaining the one which he has chosen to use; and it may be doubted whether Paul would have used an argument that required so much explanation as this before it could be understood. All these expositions proceed on the supposition that the word "mediator" here refers to Moses, and that the transaction here referred to was that on Mount Sinai. I would suggest a sense of the passage which I have found in none of the commentaries which I have consulted, and which I would, therefore, propose with diffidence.<p>All that I can claim for it is, that it may possibly be the meaning. According to the view which I shall submit, the words here are to be regarded as used in their usual signification; and the simplest interpretation possible is to be given to the propositions in the verse. One proposition is, that a mediator is not appointed with reference to one party, but to two. This proposition is universal. Wherever there is a mediator there are always two parties. The other proposition is, that God is one; that is, that he is the same one God, in whatever form his will may be made known to people, whether by a promise as to Abraham, or by the Law as to Moses. The interpretation which I would propose embraces the following particulars:<p>(1) The design of the apostle is, to show that the giving of the Law could not abrogate or affect the promise made to Abraham; and to show at the same time what is its true object. It could not annul the promises, says Paul. It was given long after, and could not affect them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>. It was an addition, an appendage, a subsequent enactment for a specific purpose, yet a part of the same general plan, and subordinate to the Mediator, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>. It was to be shown also that the Law was not against the promises of God. It was a good law <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm">Galatians 3:21</a>; and was not designed to be an opposing system, or intended to counteract the promise, or the scheme of salvation by promise, but was a part of the same great plan.<p>(2) a mediator always supposes two parties. In all the transactions, therefore, where a mediator is employed, there is supposed to be two parties. When, therefore, the promise was made to Abraham with reference to the Messiah, the great Mediator; and when the Law was given in the hand of the Mediator, and under his control, there is always supposed to be two parties.<p>(3) the whole arrangement here referred to is under the Mediator, and with reference to him. The promise made to Abraham had reference to him and to those who should believe on him; and the Law given by Moses was also under him, and with reference to him. He was the grand object and agent of all. He was the Mediator with reference to both. Each transaction had reference to him, though in different ways the transaction with Abraham relating to him in connection with a promise; the transaction at the giving of the Law being under his control as Mediator, and being a part of the one great plan. There was an identity of plan; and the plan had reference to the Messiah, the great Mediator.<p>(4) God is one and the same. He is throughout one of the parties; and he does not change. However the arrangements may vary, whether in giving the Law or imparting a promise, He is the same. There is only one God in all the transaction; and He, throughout, constitutes one of the parties. The other party is man, at first receiving the promise from this one God with reference to the Mediator through Abraham, and then receiving the Law through the same Mediator on Mount Sinai. He is still the one party unchanged; and there is the same Mediator; implying all along that there are two parties.<p>(5) it follows, therefore, agreeably to the argument of the apostle, that the Law given so long after the promise, could not abrogate it, because they pertained to the same plan, were under the same one God, who was one unchanging party in all this transaction, and had reference to the same Mediator and were alike under his control. It followed, also, that the Law was temporary <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; interposed for important purposes until the "seed should come," because it was a part of the same general arrangement, and was under the control of the same Mediator, and directed by the same one God, the unchanging one party in all these transactions. It followed, further, that the one could not be against the other <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm">Galatians 3:21</a>, because they were a part of the same plan, under the control of the same Mediator, and where the same God remained unchanged as the one party. All that is assumed in this interpretation is:<p>(a) That there was but one plan or arrangement; or that the transaction with Abraham and with Moses were parts of one great scheme; and,<p>(b) That the Mediator here referred to was not Moses, but the Messiah, the Son of God.<p>The following paraphrase will express the sense which I have endeavored to convey. "The giving of the Law could not annul or abrogate the promise made to Abraham. It was long after that, and it was itself subservient to that. It was given by the instrumentality of angels, and it was entirely under the control of the Mediator, the Messiah. The plan was one; and all the parts of it, in the promise made to Abraham and in the giving of the Law, were subordinate to him. A mediator always supposes two parties, and the reference to the Mediator, alike in the promise to Abraham and in the giving of the Law, supposes that there were two parties. God is one party, the same unchanging God in all the forms of the promise and of the Law. In this state of things, it is impossible that the Law should clash with the promise, or that it should supersede or modify it. It was a part of the one great plan; appointed with reference to the work which the Mediator came to do; and in accordance with the promise made to Abraham; and therefore they could not be contradictory and inconsistent." It is assumed in all this that the Messiah was contemplated in the whole arrangement, and that it was entered into with reference to him. That this may be assumed no one can deny who believes the scriptures. The whole arrangement in the Old Testament, it is supposed, was designed to be ancillary to redemption; and the interpretation which has been submitted above is based on that supposition. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. "Now a mediator cannot be of one (but must be of two parties whom he mediates between); but God is one" (not two: owing to His essential unity not admitting of an intervening party between Him and those to be blessed; but as the One Sovereign, His own representative, giving the blessing directly by promise to Abraham, and, in its fulfilment, to Christ, "the Seed," without new condition, and without a mediator such as the law had). The conclusion understood is, Therefore a mediator cannot appertain to God; and consequently, the law, with its inseparable appendage of a mediator, cannot be the normal way of dealing of God, the one, and unchangeable God, who dealt with Abraham by direct promise, as a sovereign, not as one forming a compact with another party, with conditions and a mediator attached thereto. God would bring man into immediate communion with Him, and not have man separated from Him by a mediator that keeps back from access, as Moses and the legal priesthood did (Ex 19:12, 13, 17, 21-24; Heb 12:19-24). The law that thus interposed a mediator and conditions between man and God, was an exceptional state limited to the Jews, and parenthetically preparatory to the Gospel, God's normal mode of dealing, as He dealt with Abraham, namely, face to face directly; by promise and grace, and not conditions; to all nations united by faith in the one seed (Eph 2:14, 16, 18), and not to one people to the exclusion and severance from the One common Father, of all other nations. It is no objection to this view, that the Gospel, too, has a mediator (1Ti 2:5). For Jesus is not a mediator separating the two parties in the covenant of promise or grace, as Moses did, but One in both nature and office with both God and man (compare "God in Christ," Ga 3:17): representing the whole universal manhood (1Co 15:22, 45, 47), and also bearing in Him "all the fulness of the Godhead." Even His mediatorial office is to cease when its purpose of reconciling all things to God shall have been accomplished (1Co 15:24); and God's ONENESS (Zec 14:9), as "all in all," shall be fully manifested. Compare Joh 1:17, where the two mediators&#8212;Moses, the severing mediator of legal conditions, and Jesus, the uniting mediator of grace&#8212;are contrasted. The Jews began their worship by reciting the Schemah, opening thus, "Jehovah our God is ONE Jehovah"; which words their Rabbis (as Jarchius) interpret as teaching not only the unity of God, but the future universality of His Kingdom on earth (Zep 3:9). Paul (Ro 3:30) infers the same truth from the ONENESS of God (compare Eph 4:4-6). He, as being One, unites all believers, without distinction, to Himself (Ga 3:8, 16, 28; Eph 1:10; 2:14; compare Heb 2:11) in direct communion. The unity of God involves the unity of the people of God, and also His dealing directly without intervention of a mediator.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is a text acknowledged by all interpreters to be very obscure; not so much as considered in itself, (for all know, that a mediator speaks one that goes in the middle between two persons that are at odds, so cannot be of one), as in regard of the connection of it with what went before; where he had told us, that the law was given <span class="ital">in the hand of a mediator.</span> There are various senses given of this verse, and the variety much ariseth from men’s different understanding of the mediator in whose hand the law was given. To me the apostle seems to magnify the promise above the law, in that the promise was given to Abraham immediately by God, (who is one in essence), but the law was given not immediately by God, but by Moses as mediator, who in that action was a type of Christ. And God thereby showed, that the law would bring no man to life and salvation without the one and only Mediator Christ Jesus. Christ, indeed, is the Mediator of the new testament, he mediated for it, he mediateth in it; but it was men’s transgression of the law that brought them in need of a Mediator, sin being the only thing that separateth between God and man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">God is one; </span> and there had been no need of mediating between him and man, but for the law which man had transgressed.

But this interpretation seems to make Christ the Mediator between Jews and Gentiles, whom (the apostle saith) he <span class="ital">made both one, </span> breaking down the partition-wall, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a></span>; but we do not find the name of Mediator upon this account any where given unto Christ. Many other senses are given, but the first mentioned seemeth the most probable, viz. that God made use of no mediator in giving the promise, but only in giving the law, which evidenced that justification was not to be by it; nor had there been need of a true Mediator under the gospel, but for the law, men’s transgression of which brought in a need of a Mediator; which proved that justification could not be by the law. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/galatians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one,.... A mediator supposes two parties he stands between, and these at a distance from, or disagreeing with each other; where there is but one party, there can be no need of, nor any reason for, a mediator; so Christ is the Mediator between God and men, the daysman, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-33.htm">Job 9:33</a>, that lays his hands upon them both; and Moses, he was the mediator between God and the Israelites: <p>but God is one; not in person, for there are three persons in the Godhead, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one, in nature and essence; so that though there are three persons, there is but one God, and who is the God both of Jews and Gentiles; who is of one mind concerning them, and has taken them into one and the same covenant, and makes use of one and the same method in the justification of them: but the true sense of the phrase here is, that whereas a mediator supposes two parties at variance, "God is one of the two"; as the Ethiopic version reads the words; he is a party offended, that stands off, and at a distance, which the law given by angels in the hand of a mediator shows; so that that is rather a sign of disagreement and alienation, and consequently that justification is not to be expected by it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now a mediator is not <i>a mediator</i> of one, <span class="cverse3">{24}</span> but God is one.</span><p>(24) A taking away of an objection, lest any man might say that sometimes by consent of the parties which have made a covenant, something is added to the covenant, or the former covenants are broken.

The <span class="ital">explanation</span> of the words, which in themselves are simple enough, is accordingly as follows: “<span class="ital">But the mediator</span>—not to leave unnoticed an inference which might possibly be drawn to the prejudice of the promises from the <span class="greekheb">ἐν χειρὶ μεσίτου</span> just said—<span class="ital">but the mediator</span>, that is, any mediator, <span class="ital">does not belong to a single person</span>, but intervenes between two or more; <span class="ital">God, on the other hand, is a single person</span>, and not a plurality. <span class="ital">Is it now</span>—when these two propositions are applied <span class="ital">in concreto</span> to the law and the promises—<span class="ital">is it now to be thence inferred that the law</span>, which was given through a mediator, and in which therefore there took part more subjects than one, in point of fact two (namely, God and Israel), between whom the mediator had to deal, <span class="ital">is opposed to the divine promises</span>, in which the same one God, who in the case of the law acted through a mediator and so implied two parties, acted directly? God forbid! From this point of difference in the divine bestowal of the law and the promises, by no means is any such conclusion to be arrived at to the prejudice of the latter, as if now, through the law mediatorially given by the one God, another divine mode of justification were to be made valid.” In this view, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a> contains two <span class="ital">loci communes</span>, from the mutual relation of which in reference to the two <span class="ital">concreta</span> under discussion (the law and the promises) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God?

The <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> is in both cases adversative: the first introducing a supposed objection, and the second an incidental point belonging to this objection, the relation of which incidental point to the first proposition strengthens the doubt excited; <span class="greekheb">ὁ μεσίτης</span> denotes the mediator absolutely as <span class="ital">genus</span> (“quae multa sunt cunctis in unum colligendis,” Hermann, <span class="ital">ad Iph.

Although no special dogmatic interest attached to the passage, nevertheless in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (see Poole’s <span class="ital">Synopsis</span>) the variety of interpretations was already such that almost every interpreter of importance (yet, as a rule, without polemical controversy, because the dogmatic element did not come into play) took a way of his own. It became, however, still greater after the middle of the eighteenth century (especially after grammatico-historical exegesis gained ground, but with an abundant intermixture of its philological aberrations), and is even now continually increasing. How often have the most mistaken fancies and the crudest conjectures sought to gain acceptance in connection with our passage, the explanation of which was regarded as a feat of exegetical skill! For a general view of the mass of interpretations, the following works are of service:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Koppe, <span class="ital">Exc</span>. VII. p. 128 ff. ed.

I. p. 211 ff.: Winer, <span class="ital">Exc</span>. III.: Schott, p. 455 ff.: Wieseler, and de Wette ed. Möller, <span class="ital">in loc</span>. It is enough that out of the multitude of various interpretations—omitting the criticism in detail of the earlier views down to Keil[150]—we specify the more recent literature, and adduce the following: 1. Keil, who comes nearest to our view, explains thus (see <span class="ital">Opusc</span>. I. p. 365 ff.): <span class="ital">“Mediatorem quidem non unius sed duarum certe partium esse, Deum autem, qui Abrahamo beneficii aliquid promiserit, unum modo fuisse; hincque apostolum id a lectoribus suis colligi voluisse, in lege ista Mos. pactum mutuum Deum inter atque populum Israelit. mediatoris opera intercedente initum fuisse, contra vero in promissione rem ab unius tantum (Dei sc., qui solus eam dederit) voluntate pendentem transactam, hincque legi isti nihil plane cum hac rei fuisse, adeoque nec potuisse ea novam illius promissionis implendae conditionem constitui, eoque ipso promissionem hanc omnino tolli.”</span> But (<span class="ital">a</span>) to take the second half of the verse not generally, like the first, but historically, as if <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> was written, is an arbitrary deviation from the parallelism; and (<span class="ital">b</span>) the conclusion professedly to be drawn by the reader, <span class="ital">hincque legi isti nihil</span>, etc., is quite without warrant, for <span class="ital">Paul himself</span> puts as a question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.">Galatians 3:21</a> the inference which he conceives may be possibly drawn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a>. 2. Schleiermacher’s explanation is essentially similar (in Usteri, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr</span>. p. 186 ff.): “<span class="ital">The mediator of an agreement does not exist where there is only one person, but always presupposes two persons; these were God and the Jewish nation. But God is One in reference to His promises; that is, God therein acts quite freely, unconditionally, independently, and for Himself alone, as One numerically, because it is no agreement between two, but His free gift</span> (<span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>). <span class="ital">Does the law therefore conflict</span>, etc.?”[151] But in this view (<span class="ital">a</span>) the application of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a> to the <span class="ital">concreta</span> of the law and the promises, which is in fact not made until <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.">Galatians 3:21</a>, is imported into and anticipated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a>. Moreover, (<span class="ital">b</span>) <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span> imperceptibly changes from its numerical sense into the idea of aloneness and independence; and (<span class="ital">c</span>) the idea of free grace is arbitrarily introduced, and is not expressed by Paul. Nearest to this interpretation of Schleiermacher and Usteri comes Hilgenfeld, whose interpretation,[152] accompanied essentially by the same difficulties, ultimately amounts to the non-Pauline idea, that the position of God as a party in regard to the law is not in harmony with the divine unity (that is, with the divine monarchy). Comp. also Lipsius, <span class="ital">Rechtfertigungsl</span>. p. 77, according to whom Paul negatively “strikes the law to the ground as incompatible with the sole agency of God.” But how could Paul desire to strike to the ground the law, which to him was <span class="greekheb">ἅγιος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθός</span>, and <span class="greekheb">πνευματικός</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-12.htm" title="Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.">Romans 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm" title="For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.">Romans 7:14</a>)? No, all he desires to show is, that, notwithstanding the diversity of its divine bestowal from the mode of giving the promise, it is not opposed to the promise. 3. Winer: “<span class="ital">Non potest</span> <span class="greekheb">μεσίτης</span> <span class="ital">cogitari aut fingi, qui sit</span> <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span>, <span class="ital">unius h. e. unius partis:</span> <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ Θεὸς εἷς ἐστι</span>, <span class="ital">Deus est unus, una</span> (<span class="ital">altera</span>) <span class="ital">tantummodo pars; ita quaenam est altera? gens Israel. Jam si hoc, sponte efficitur, legem Mos. pertinere etiam ad Judaeos, hosque legi isti observandae adstrictos fuisse.”</span>[153] Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a> contains only a parenthetical idea, Paul having in view to re-establish the dignity of the law, which appeared weakened by <span class="greekheb">τῶν παραβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χάριν προσετέθη</span>: “<span class="ital">Lex Mos. data fuit peccatorum gratia; propterea vero non est, quod quis eam tanquam ista</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελίᾳ</span> <span class="ital">longe inferiorem contemnat; data enim et ipsa est auctoritate divina</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διαταγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἀγγέλων</span>—<span class="ital">gentique Hebr. tanquam agendi norma proposita</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν χειρὶ μεσίτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὃς οὐκ ἔστιν ἑνός</span>.” It cannot be urged against Winer, that Paul must necessarily have written <span class="greekheb">ὁ εἷς</span> (see Winer, <span class="ital">Gramm</span>. p. 110 [E. T. 144]). But (<span class="ital">a</span>) in the logically exact chain of argument there is no indication at all that <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a> is to be taken as a parenthesis. (<span class="ital">b</span>) Since <span class="greekheb">ὁ μεσίτης</span> is <span class="ital">subject</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span>, which likewise is placed at the beginning of the sentence, may not be arbitrarily understood as <span class="ital">predicate</span>. (<span class="ital">c</span>) It must have been more precisely indicated by Paul, if it were intended that the first <span class="greekheb">ἐστίν</span> should be understood as the copula of a general judgment, and the second as historical (<span class="ital">appears in the giving of the law</span>); for every reader, if he had understood the first half of the verse as a general judgment, would naturally understand the second in like manner. (<span class="ital">d</span>) It would not occur to any reader to refer <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span> to a suppressed <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἕτερος</span>: for <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span> had just been used absolutely in a numerical sense, in which therefore <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span> at once presents itself; and this the more, because the first sentence, by its negative form, has prepared the way for an antithesis to follow. (<span class="ital">e</span>) The idea which <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ Θεὸς εἷς ἐστιν</span> is supposed to indicate: <span class="ital">therefore the law is obligatory on the Israelites</span>, conveys something which is so entirely a matter of course, that it could not be made use of at all as an element of the <span class="ital">dignity</span> of the law; for the law was, in fact, <span class="ital">given</span> to the Israelites, and even to <span class="ital">think</span> of that obligation as non-existent would have been incongruous. And (<span class="ital">f</span>) even assuming such a superfluous idea, in what a strangely mysterious way would Paul have intimated it! That which he meant to <span class="ital">say</span>, he would wholly without reason have <span class="ital">concealed</span>, and have given out as it were a riddle. Apart from the unsuitableness of the idea generally, and from the inappropriate <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span>, he must have said: <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ Ἰσραὴλ εἷς ἐστιν</span>. 4. Schulthess has sought to vindicate his interpretation (proposed in Keil and Tzschirner’s <span class="ital">Anal</span>. II. 3, p. 133 ff.) in his <span class="ital">Engelwelt, Engelgesetz und Engeldienst</span>, Zürich 1833, and in <span class="ital">de G. Hermanno, enodatore ep. P. ad Gal</span>., Zürich 1835, viz.: “<span class="ital">Hic mediator</span> (<span class="ital">Moses</span>) <span class="ital">non est mediator unius, i.e. communis illius Dei, qui olim Abrahamo spopondit, per eum aliquando gentes beatum iri, et qui est unus, s. communis omnium parens, sed est potius mediator angelorum</span>.”[154] But (<span class="ital">a</span>) how erroneous it is to assume that the anarthrous <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span> should denote the universal God of men, and how alien this reference is to the context! (<span class="ital">b</span>) How opposed is the <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἀγγέλων</span> to the notion, that Moses was “mediator <span class="ital">angelorum”!</span> (<span class="ital">c</span>) How at variance is the idea of the law as the work <span class="ital">of angels</span> with the conception throughout the Bible (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>) of the law as the work <span class="ital">of God!</span> In how wholly different a way must Paul have spoken of and <span class="ital">proved</span> such a paradox, and how <span class="ital">frequently</span> would he have reverted to it (especially in the Epistle to the Romans) in his antinomistic discussions! 5. Akin to this, as far as the idea is concerned, is the interpretation of Schmieder (<span class="ital">Nova interpr. I. Paul. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a></span> f., Numb. 1826, and in Tholuck’s <span class="ital">literar. Anz</span>. 1830, No. 54): “<span class="ital">Quivis minister vel multorum est vel unius: atqui mediator non est unius: ergo est multorum minister. Qui multorum est minister, ad quod genus mediator pertinet, non est unius: atqui Deus (absolute) unus est: ergo cum multorum sit mediator, non est Dei minister</span>.” The connection is supposed to be: “<span class="ital">Concedo legem per angelos datam esse a Deo, non humana arte inventam, sed eo ipso, quod per angelos ministros, non per Deum aut Dei filium promulgata est, inferior est evangelio</span>.”[155] This interpretation is objectionable, (<span class="ital">a</span>) in a general point of view, because it rests wholly on the erroneous view that <span class="greekheb">μεσίτου</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a> applies not to Moses, but to the <span class="ital">angelus mediator;</span> (<span class="ital">b</span>) because Paul could not have expressed so peculiar an antinomistic argument more obscurely or more enigmatically than by thus <span class="ital">omitting</span> the essential points; (<span class="ital">c</span>) because the idea of <span class="greekheb">μεσίτης</span> by no means implies that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΣΊΤΗς</span></span></span> is the “minister <span class="ital">multorum:</span>” he may be commissioned as well by one as by many, as, in fact, Christ was commissioned as a <span class="greekheb">μεσίτης</span> by One, viz. by God. See also, in opposition to Schmieder, Lücke in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1828, p. 95 ff.; Winer, <span class="ital">Exc</span>. III. p. 171 ff. 6. Steudel, in Bengel’s <span class="ital">Archiv</span> I. p. 124 ff., supposes that <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a> is an opponent’s question: “<span class="ital">To what purpose then serves the law? Was it bestowed merely somehow as an additional gift on account of transgressions</span> (<span class="ital">in order to be transgressed</span>), <span class="ital">until the seed should come to whom the promise applied? And yet was it made known through angels, and by the ministry of a mediator?</span>” To which Paul answers, “<span class="ital">Certainly through the ministry of a mediator; only he was not the mediator of an united seed</span> (of the <span class="greekheb">σπέρματος τῶν πιστεύοντων</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>), <span class="ital">but God is one</span> (<span class="ital">not another for the Gentiles</span>).” But (<span class="ital">a</span>) there is nothing that indicates any such division of the passage into dialogue; and (<span class="ital">b</span>) how strange it would be that Paul should have grasped, and furnished a reply to, nothing but the <span class="ital">last</span> part of the opponent’s question, <span class="greekheb">ἐν χειρὶ μεσίτου</span>, which, moreover, would be only a subordinate part of it! (<span class="ital">c</span>) The article must be added to <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span>, if it is to apply to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΠΈΡΜΑ</span></span></span> already spoken of (as assumed also by Jatho); but <span class="ital">no</span> supplement whatever to <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span> is suggested by the context;[156] and if <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἑνὸς σπέρματος</span> were read, then, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>, it would mean not the body of Christians, but Christ Himself.[157] (<span class="ital">d</span>) <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span> and <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span> would be taken in different senses: <span class="ital">united</span> and <span class="ital">one</span>.[158] 7. Sack (in the <span class="ital">Tüb. Zeitschr</span>. 1831, I. p. 106 f.) supposes that Paul avails himself of the idea of a mediator to <span class="ital">limit</span> the recognition of the law, which perhaps some Jewish Christians were disposed to assert to an exaggerated extent, and says: “<span class="ital">The mediator, however, is not of one kind, but God is One and the same. For us Christians there is certainly another mediator than Moses; but God, the God in both Testaments, is nevertheless One and the same</span>.” But it is obvious that <span class="greekheb">ἑνός ἐστιν</span> cannot mean <span class="ital">unius generis est</span>, and it is equally evident that the clause, “for us Christians there is certainly,” etc., is arbitrarily brought in. See also Schneckenburger, <span class="ital">Beitr</span>. p. 187 f., and (in opposition to Steudel, Kern, and Sack) Winer, <span class="ital">Zeitschr. f. wissensch. Theol</span>. II. 1, p. 31 ff. 8. Hermann: “<span class="ital">Interventor non est unius</span> (<span class="ital">i. e. interventor ubi est, duos minimum esse oportet, inter quos ille interveniat</span>); <span class="ital">Deus autem unus est: ergo apud Deum non cogitari potest interventor; esset enim is, qui intercederet inter Deum et Deum, quod absurdum est</span>.” And the connection is: “<span class="ital">Id agebat P. ut ostenderet, legem Mosis, quae nihil neque cum promissione Abrahamo data neque cum praesente effectione promissionis commune haberet, dumtaxat interim valuisse, jam autem non amplius valere. Rationem reddit hanc, quod superaddita sit</span> (<span class="ital">ideo</span> <span class="greekheb">προσετέθη</span> <span class="ital">dixit</span>), <span class="ital">eoque non pertineat ad testamentum, cui non liceat quidquam addi; deinde quod non, sicut testamentum illud, ab ipso Deo condita et data, sed disposita per angelos allataque sit manu interventoris: atqui interventori, quod interventor non sit unius, non esse locum apud Deum, qui unus sit, utpote testator, cujus unius ex voluntate nemine intercedente haereditatem capiat haeres</span>.” But (<span class="ital">a</span>) it could not be expected that the reader should derive from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a> the idea that no mediator is conceivable in the case of God on account of His oneness; nor could it be so conceived by Paul himself, for, in fact, with the one God a mediator may certainly have a place,—not, however, “<span class="ital">inter Deum et Deum</span>,” into which absurdity no one could fall, unless Paul so expressed it, but <span class="ital">inter Deum et homines</span>, in which office the history of the theocracy showed so many mediators and at last Christ Himself. (<span class="ital">b</span>) The question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.">Galatians 3:21</a> (<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>), with the answer expressive of horror, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΓΈΝΟΙΤΟ</span></span></span>, presupposes that the subject-matter of this question—consequently an antagonistic relation of the law to the promises—<span class="ital">might possibly</span> (although quite unduly) <span class="ital">be derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a></span>. But according to Hermann, Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator....">Galatians 3:19-20</a> has already proved that an antagonism of the law to the promises does <span class="ital">not</span> exist, that the law was no longer valid, and had nothing at all in common with the promises. So, in a logical point of view, the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.">Galatians 3:21</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ οὖν νόμος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., could not be asked, nor could the answer <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΓΈΝΟΙΤΟ</span></span></span> be made. (<span class="ital">c</span>) It may, besides, be urged against Hermann, that not only is <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἀγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν χειρὶ μεσ</span>. regarded as lowering the authority of the law, but a quite undue stress is also laid upon <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΕΤΈΘΗ</span></span></span>; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a> the emphasis lies on <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῶΝ ΠΑΡΑΒ</span></span></span>. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΆΡΙΝ</span></span></span>. 9. Matthies (as in substance also Rinck, <span class="ital">Lucubr. crit</span>. p. 172 ff., and in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1834, p. 309 ff.) interprets: “<span class="ital">But the mediator … does not relate to one, for his nature is in fact divided or disunited, since he is placed between two sides or parties opposed to one another; and therefore in connection with him we cannot think of unity, but only of duality, or of the variance subsisting between two parties; but God is One, comprehends in Himself nothing but unity, so that His nature contains no variance or disunion</span>.” Thus also, in the main, de Wette,[159] and among the older expositors Jac. Cappellus. But the simple <span class="ital">numerical</span> conception of unity is thus arbitrarily transformed into the <span class="ital">philosophical</span> idea, and the contrast of <span class="ital">plurality</span> is turned into the contrast of <span class="ital">disunion</span>. How could a reader discover in <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεὸς εἷς ἐστιν</span> anything else than the popular doctrine of Monotheism? 10.

But it is decidedly erroneous, on account of the sense of <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΝΌς</span></span></span> being changed into the idea of <span class="ital">immutabilis</span> (for which Schott should not have appealed to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-30.htm" title="Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.">Romans 3:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm" title="Only let your conversation be as it becomes the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;">Php 1:27</a>); and also because the proposition <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ μεσίτης ἑνὸς οὐκ ἔστιν</span> is limited to <span class="ital">causae humanae</span>, and yet the inference is supposed to be therein conveyed that the <span class="ital">Sinaitic legislation</span> is not always valid. Paul assuredly could never have thus illogically corrected the zealots for the law, and then in the very same breath have set aside the inference by <span class="ital">attamen Deus est unus</span>. 11. Gurlitt (in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1837, p. 805 ff.; 1843, p. 715 ff.) refers <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span> to the <span class="ital">Gentile Christians</span>, as one of the two divisions of the <span class="greekheb">σπέρμα Ἀβρ</span>.: “<span class="ital">The law was given through angels and through a mediator, and God indeed is throughout only One; what proceeds from Him, therefore, demands in every case equal recognition. It must nevertheless be taken into consideration, that the mediator is no mediator of those who were previously Gentiles, and that therefore the law was not destined for the latter by God Himself.”</span> But, apart from the fact that in this view of <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span> there must have been previous mention of a twofold posterity of Abraham and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῦ ἙΝΌς</span></span></span> must have been here used, and not to mention that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΝΌς</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἿς</span></span></span> are not taken as alike in sense, the interpretation must be at once pronounced decidedly wrong, because it depends upon the erroneous view that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΠΈΡΜΑ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>, means not merely Christ Himself, but also the <span class="ital">corpus mysticum</span> of Christ. 12. Olshausen, taking <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ Θεὸς εἷς ἐστιν</span> as: <span class="ital">God is one or a single one, and consequently only one party</span>, explains it thus: “Mediation presupposes a state of separation, and there can be no mediation in the case of one; since God is the one party, there must also have been a second, viz. men, who were separated from God. In the gospel it is otherwise: in Christ, the representative of the Church, all are one; all separations and distinctions are done away in Him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a>). Thus Paul, in order to call attention to the inferiority of the law to the gospel, gives a cursory, parenthetic explanation as to the idea of a mediator. This is (1) unsuitable to the context; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>, <span class="greekheb">διαταγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἀγγέλων ἐν χειρὶ μεσ</span>. has set forth the <span class="ital">glory</span> of the giving of the law. (2) The idea: <span class="ital">and consequently also only one party</span>, is quite arbitrarily <span class="ital">added</span> to <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ Θεὸς εἷς ἐστιν</span>. (3) In like manner, all the rest which is supposed properly to constitute the sense of the words (“men, who were separated from God;” “in the gospel it is otherwise,” etc.) is the pure invention of the expositor. 13. Matthias,[160] correctly explaining the first half of the verse, sees in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ΔῈ ΘΕῸς ΕἿς ἘΣΤΙΝ</span></span></span> the minor premiss of an <span class="ital">enthymeme</span>, which has to be completed by supplying the major premiss and conclusion: <span class="ital">“If God is one of those two parties, the law, although ordained by angels, is nevertheless an ordinance of God; but God is this; and consequently the law, etc., is an ordinance, not of angels, but of God.”</span> Against this interpretation we may urge that the special connection with the point <span class="greekheb">διαταγεὶς διʼ ἀγγέλων</span> is <span class="ital">not</span> conveyed by the text; that the explanation of <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span> by <span class="ital">alter</span> is contrary to the context; that <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.">Galatians 3:21</a> would be unsuitably subjoined from a logical point of view (see on <span class="greekheb">κατά</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.">Galatians 3:21</a>); and lastly, that the idea of the law being an ordinance of God was one altogether undisputed and not needing any proof. 14. Ewald (comp. also his <span class="ital">Jahrb</span>. IV. p. 109) assumes that Paul with this “quick flash of thought” intended to say: “The idea of the mediator necessarily presupposes two different living beings between whom, as being at variance or separated, mediation has to take place; because <span class="ital">the mediator of one is not</span>, does not <span class="ital">exist</span> at all, is an impossibility. But since <span class="ital">God</span> is in strictness only <span class="ital">One</span>, and does not consist of two inwardly different Gods or of an earlier and later God, it is evident that Moses as mediator did not mediate between the God of the promise and the God of the law, and thereby mix up the law with the promise and cancel the promise by the later law; but he only mediated (as is well known) between God and the people of that time.” But even this interpretation, the thought of which would probably have been expressed most simply by Paul writing <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ μεσίτης Θεοῦ ἐστιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ Θεὸς εἷς ἐστιν</span>, is liable to the objections urged above (under 8) against Hermann’s explanation. 15. According to Hofmann (compare also his <span class="ital">Schrifitbew</span>. II. 2, p. 55 ff.), the <span class="ital">first</span> half of the verse is intended to affirm <span class="ital">that, where there is only one to whom something is to be given, there is no room for mediatorship;</span> such an individual recipient may receive it directly. Now, as the promise ran to Abraham’s posterity <span class="ital">as an unity</span>, it is evident that the giving of the law, just because it was destined for a plurality of individuals, could be no fulfilment of the promise. The <span class="ital">second</span> half of the verse, which with <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> passes on to the <span class="ital">divine</span> side of the event, <span class="ital">places the unity of God in contradistinction to the plurality of angels; that which comes to men through the latter must be of a different kind from the promised gift, which the One was to give to the One—the one God to the one Christ</span>. Thus on this side also it is clear that the giving of the law was not the fulfilment of the promise, but was only ordained for the time, until Christ should come. But (<span class="ital">a</span>) all this artificial interpretation must at once fall to the ground, because it conceives <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span> to be opposed to a plurality of <span class="ital">recipient</span> subjects; for it is not true that the bestowal through a mediator presupposes such a plurality, seeing that it may take place just as well with one as with, many recipients. (<span class="ital">b</span>) It is incorrect that the unity of God is placed in contrast with the plurality of <span class="ital">angels</span> (which is not even marked, by <span class="greekheb">πολλῶν ἀγγ</span>. or the like): it stands in contrast to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἙΝῸς ΟὐΚ ἜΣΤΙΝ</span></span></span>, and it is untrue that the “<span class="ital">mediateness</span> of the giving involved its taking place through <span class="ital">many</span>”—just as if the mediate giving could not with equal fitness take place through one, as in fact it has very often been given by God through one! (<span class="ital">c</span>) Paul’s intention is, not to show that the giving of the law was not <span class="ital">the fulfilment</span> of the promise, but, as is clearly evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.">Galatians 3:21</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/galatians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a>. The rendering of the first clause in our versions, <span class="ital">Now a mediator is not a mediator of one</span>, reduces it to an unmeaning truism. The author is not treating of mediators in the abstract, but writes of Moses the mediator of the Law that he was not mediator of one chosen family; and so contrasts God’s revelation through him with the previous covenant. That covenant had been made with Abraham in person, and embraced a single chosen family (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>) restricted from generation to generation by continuous selection of God’s elect until it centred in Christ Himself. Not so the covenant of Sinai: it was addressed, not to one family (<span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς</span>, <span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">σπέρματος</span>), but to many families of Abraham’s children after the flesh. This change of recipients involved a vital change in the revelation also whereas the promise had quickened faith by an appeal to gratitude and love, the Law used threats of wrath and punishment to deter corrupt and carnal natures from indulging the vices of the flesh.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The stress laid on the unity of the chosen seed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a> and the ellipsis of <span class="greekheb">σπέρματα</span> with <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάνατα</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-22.htm" title="But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.">Galatians 3:22</a> justify us in understanding <span class="greekheb">σπέρματος</span> here with <span class="greekheb">ἑνός</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ Θεὸς εἷς ἐστιν</span>. The recurrence of the same phrase <span class="greekheb">εἷς ὁ Θεός</span> with a corresponding force in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-30.htm" title="Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.">Romans 3:30</a> suggests its true force and connection with the context in this place. The Apostle is there urging the real harmony of God’s dealings with Jews and Gentiles, however different the method employed for justifying the two severally; and argues that it is nevertheless one and the same God who will justify both. So here after differentiating the revelation made through Moses from that to Abraham, he is careful to add that the God of Sinai is one with the God of Abraham, however distinct might be the two revelations. The true force of the clause may be expressed as follows, <span class="ital">but the God</span> (<span class="ital">sc.</span> the God of Sinai) <span class="ital">is one with the God of promise</span>. The twofold revelation of the name of God to Moses as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and as the eternal God <span class="ital">I am that I am</span>, suggests the same thought of the divine unity in spite of the various aspects in which God reveals Himself to successive generations of men.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. Probably no verse of Scripture has more exercised the ingenuity of commentators. Certainly of none other can it be said that it ‘has received 430 interpretations’ (Jowett), if by that expression contrariant or different interpretations are meant. Some notice of these is reserved for an Appendix (Appendix v. p. 89). The verse may be paraphrased as follows: Now the very fact that at the giving of the Law a Mediator was needed, marks the nature of the transaction as a compact entered into between <span class="ital">two</span> parties. The very term <span class="ital">Mediator</span> implies two parties between whom he intervenes. But the God of the promise is One and One only. He reveals Himself as the bestower of a free gift to the world. ‘The Giver is everything, the recipient nothing’ (Lightfoot). Hence there was no place in the Gospel revelation for a mediator in the sense in which Moses was mediator between God and the people of Israel. It may be observed that this view of the scope of the passage (which is all that is necessary to its connexion with the preceding and following context) does not militate against, nor is it inconsistent with, the declaration that there is ‘One Mediator between God and man’, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm" title="For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The young student of theology needs to be cautioned against the too common mistake of treating a verse of Scripture as if it were an isolated proposition, instead of regarding it in its relation to the <span class="ital">train of thought</span> to the expression of which it contributes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On Chapter <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a>Of the many explanations which have been given of this passage a few of the most important may be noticed. They may be classified in three divisions, according to the supposed reference in the term <span class="ital">Mediator</span>:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The earlier expositors understood the term Mediator in the passage before us to refer to <span class="ital">Christ</span>. In favour of this view it may of course be urged that in all other passages of the N. T. (see note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a></span>) where the word occurs it refers to our Lord Jesus Christ. But it no more follows that the word thus applied to our Lord so loses its primary meaning as to be appropriated exclusively to Him, than that the words ‘shepherd’ and ‘bishop’ must necessarily refer to Him in every passage where they occur, because He is ‘the Shepherd and Bishop’ of our souls. Even if the reference to Christ could be established as a simple and natural explanation of the passage, taken by itself, the connexion with the context is obscured or lost, and the force of the Apostle’s argument impaired thereby.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. More probable is the opinion that in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a></span>, as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a></span>, the Mediator is Moses. (The definite article in the Greek may lend equal support to this and to the next explanation.) This opinion, entertained by eminent commentators, both ancient and modern, is in full accord with the scope of the passage. But the reference, though suggested by, is not therefore limited to the giving of the Law. ‘The mediator,’ just spoken of (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a></span>), is undoubtedly Moses, but what was true of him in that capacity is also true of every other <span class="ital">human</span> mediator.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Lastly, we may regard the first portion of the verse as laying down a general proposition. Those who hold this view adopt the rendering of the English Bible, both A.V. and R.V. alike, as correct, and understand it to express ‘the idea, the specific type,’ and to state a characteristic of the Mediator, <span class="ital">as such</span>. The very idea of mediation implies a transaction involving the existence of at least two parties, and mutual conditions. But the Gospel is a promise, the gift of grace. God alone is its author, and its fulfilment depends on His faithfulness—on Himself alone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Under each of these general divisions (especially the last) a great many explanations, differing in some particulars, are found. Many of these, so far from being destructive of one another, are not inconsistent or irreconcilable with one another. The slighter differences help to illustrate and confirm the great truth which St Paul is enforcing, rather than to obscure his meaning or render it uncertain. A more detailed account of these, with the names of their principal authors, may be found in Dr Schaffe’s Commentary, Excursus, p. 38, who gives the following extract from Reuss’s French Commentary, which clearly expresses one, and perhaps the best-supported, view of the passage under consideration: “A mediator implies two contracting parties, consequently two wills, which may be united, but may also disagree; a law therefore given by mediation is conditional and imperfect: but the promise, emanating from God <span class="ital">alone</span>, and having His will for its sole source and guarantee, is infinitely more sure and more elevated. The law, then, cannot set aside the promise, its aim can only be secondary.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/galatians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm" title="Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.">Galatians 3:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ δὲ μεσίτης</span>, <span class="ital">now a Mediator</span>) The article has the meaning of the relative. <span class="ital">That Mediator</span>, Moses, who was far later than the promise, and at the same time severe.—<span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς</span>, <span class="ital">of one</span>) The middle term of the syllogism, of which the major and minor proposition is expressed, the conclusion is understood, <span class="ital">One does not make use of that Mediator</span> (that is, whosoever is one [one and the same unchanging being] does not transact first without a mediator, then the same one through a mediator; nor does he afterwards withdraw himself [after having first dealt with His people <span class="ital">immediately</span> and <span class="ital">directly</span>], so as to transact through a mediator; for familiar acquaintance does not generally decrease, but increase): but <span class="ital">God is one</span>. Therefore God did not transact first without a mediator, then through a mediator. Therefore that party, to which the mediator belonged, is not one and the same with God, but different from God, namely <span class="ital">the law</span>.[28]—<span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ Θεὸς εἷς ἐστιν</span>, <span class="ital">but God is one</span>) There is not one God before and another after the giving of the law, but one and the same God. Before the law He transacted without a mediator; therefore the mediator at Mount Sinai does not belong to God, but to the law; whereas the promise belongs to God; comp. on the unity of God, in reference to the same subject, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-30.htm" title="Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.">Romans 3:30</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm" title="For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;">1 Timothy 2:5</a> : and the oneness of God before and after the law agrees most beautifully with the oneness of the seed before and after the law. Thus Paul infers from the very manner of giving the law, that the law was given on account of sin; and thus the new objection in the following verse is in consonance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[28] The syllogism is one of the first figure in Ferio. The major prop. is: One does not make use of that mediator. The minor is: But God is one; and the conclusion is, therefore God does not use that mediator. But the conclusion drawn by Bengel is not directly from the major prop., but from the explanation of it within the parenthesis, and is perfectly sound according to his statement. The conclusion in the last sentence is not quite so clear. Let it be remembered, however, that there was a double mediation. God delegated the law to angels, who gave it to Moses: therefore Moses came between the law and the people.—TRANSL.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - This verse, closing the short paragraph commencing the verse which precedes it, appears designed to mark the difference of the relations which subsisted between the Lord and Israel at the time of the giving of the Law, compared with those which subsist between God and Abraham's seed in the covenant of grace. <span class="cmt_word">Now a mediator is not a mediator</span> <span class="cmt_word">of one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The article with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, literally, "the mediator," marks the noun as a class noun, giving it the sense, "a mediator as such."

The clause means this: a mediator implies the existence of more than one party, of two parties at least, for him to mediate between; of two parties not at one, but standing on such terms towards each other as make his intervention necessary. So far as it characterized the giving of the Law viewed in contrast with the establishment of the covenant of grace, the mediation of Moses, as has been already observed, did not put an end to the estrangement between the Lord and Israel: the estrangement went on throughout Moses' life; throughout, the Israelites stand marked with the brand of "transgression." The genitive <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "of one," is the same as the genitive in <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "Mediator of God and men," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>: it marks the party or parties towards whom the function of mediation is exercised; so that what the apostle here affirms is that there cannot be only one such party. <span class="cmt_word">But God is</span> <span class="cmt_word">one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). When we consider the number of interpretations given of this clause in connection with the preceding, which have literally been computed by hundreds (the reader will find a <span class="accented">spieilegium</span> of some sixty or eighty of them in Meyer), we may infer with certainty that the sense which the apostle intended to convey is not an obvious one - not one which lies near the surface. So much appears, however, in the highest degree probable, that he refers either to some disadvantageous circumstance attaching to the Law or to some advantageous circumstance attaching to the covenant of promise, and is viewing the two in contrast the one with the other. On these grounds the present writer has long since acquiesced in the view propounded by Windischmann in his Commentary on this Epistle, and which is accepted by Bishop Ellicott, that the unity here predicated of God is the oneness subsisting between the  Father and the Son. God is one in the Father and in his Son - Christ our Lord. The fact is now present to the apostle's mind, and is presently after stated by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>), that the Son has been "sent forth" by God to redeem us and make us sons, and has thus become the "Christ," that "Seed of Abraham" to which the promises had been made (ver. 29 of this chapter). Hereby the most perfect oneness is established between God and the heirs of the promise; for these are "clothed with Christ" (ver. 27) the Son of God; and he being one with the Father, they in and through him are really and permanently "reconciled <span class="accented">into</span> God," as the apostle writes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>. Compare our Lord's words in his intercessory prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21, 23</a>), "That they all may be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us. I in them, and thou in me; that they may be perfected into one." That this sense lies deep down in the apostle's words and would not have readily been presented by them to the minds of his readers, forms no valid objection to this interpretation; for the history of the exegesis of the passage proves that this must have been the case with the sense which the apostle really designed to indicate, whatever that was. On the other hand, it is a sense which perfectly suits the requirement of the context; for it illustrates the superiority of the covenant of the promise to the covenant of the Law in the strongest manner possible. The nut has a very hard shell, but it yields a delicious kernel. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Now a mediator is not a mediator of one (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Observe, 1. &#x394;&#x3b5;&#768; is explanatory, not antithetic. The verse illustrates the conception of mediator. 2. The article, the mediator, has a generic force: the mediator according to the general and proper conception of his function. Comp. the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>); the shepherd, the good (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). 3. &#x395;&#788;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; of one, is to be explained by the following &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3c2;, so that it is masculine and personal. We are not to supply party or law. The meaning is: the conception of mediator does not belong to an individual considered singly. One is not a mediator of his single self, but he is a mediator between two contracting parties; in this case between God and the people of Israel, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-46.htm">Leviticus 26:46</a>; thus differing from Christ, who is called the mediator of a new covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>). The new covenant, the gospel, was not a contract. Accordingly <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-20.htm">Galatians 3:20</a> serves to define the true conception of a mediator, and through this definition to make clearer the difference between the law, which required a mediator, and the promise, which is the simple expression of God's will. The very idea of mediation supposes two parties. The law is of the nature of a contract between God and the Jewish people. The validity of the contract depends on its fulfillment by both parties. Hence it is contingent, not absolute.<p>But God is one (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>God does not need a mediator to make his promise valid. His promise is not of the nature of a contract between two parties. His promise depends on his own individual decree. He dealt with Abraham singly and directly, without a mediator. The dignity of the law is thus inferior to that of the promise. </body></html>
