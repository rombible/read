The first great outpouring of the Spirit, both in its miraculous and non-miraculous forms, though checked, had not entirely ceased; and the Galatians might thus see, simply by looking around them, that the channel which God chose for conveying His gifts was not that upon which the Judaisers insisted—the Law—but rather the preaching of faith. Where the faith implanted by the Apostle’s preaching still showed signs of vital growth, there the gifts of the Spirit were seen in connection with it; but not amongst the Judaisers and their party.<p><span class= "bld">Therefore.</span>—This word takes up again the question which had been started in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm" title="This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:2</a>, but brings it down, as it were, to the present time. The opposition between the effects of faith, on the one hand, and works, on the other, was conspicuous when the Galatians were first converted; it is as conspicuous still. The argument is the same, whichever standpoint is assumed.<p><span class= "bld">Ministereth.</span>—The notion contained in this word is not only that of “supply,” but of “<span class= "ital">liberal</span> supply.” At Athens it was the custom for wealthy citizens to bear the cost of bringing out the chorus—which was practically equivalent to putting a play upon the stage—at the great public feasts. The word translated “ministereth” was the technical term for this. The same word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm" title="Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)">2Corinthians 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-11.htm" title="For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.">2Peter 1:11</a>. In three out of the four places it is rendered by the same word “minister;” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm" title="And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;">2Peter 1:5</a> it appears in the phrase “<span class= "ital">add</span> to your faith virtue” (rather, <span class= "ital">furnish</span> <span class= "ital">forth in your faith virtue</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> “let your faith prompt you to abundant acts of virtue”). “He that ministereth” is, of course, God.<p><span class= "bld">Worketh miracles among you.</span>—The Greek means not so much “causes miracles to be wrought in your midst” as “implants in you miraculous powers.” The power to work miracles is regarded as a special faculty bestowed by God upon individual Christians. The means by which they become receptive of it is that enthusiastic condition aroused in them by faith. Mere formal obedience to a written law had no such efficacy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?...">Galatians 3:5-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">He therefore </span>— Namely, God; <span class="ital">that ministereth to you the Spirit </span>— Who is continually giving you additional supplies of grace by the Spirit; <span class="ital">and worketh miracles, </span>&c. — Bestows the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit upon you; <span class="ital">doeth he it by the works of the law </span>— Through your hearing and embracing the doctrine of those who inculcate the necessity of observing the ceremonies of the law; <span class="ital">or by the hearing of faith </span>— By your hearing, receiving, and acquiescing in the doctrine of justification and salvation by faith in Christ and his gospel?

The apostle, both in this and in the epistle to the Romans, makes great use of the instance of Abraham; the rather, because from Abraham the Jews drew their great argument (as they do at this day) both for their own continuance in Judaism, and for denying the Gentiles to be the church of God. <span class="ital">As Abraham believed God </span>— When God said, <span class="ital">Thy seed shall be as the stars; and it was accounted to him for righteousness</span> — Because his belief of this promise implied that he entertained just conceptions of the divine power, goodness, and veracity.

They had the doctrine of the cross preached, and the Lord's supper administered among them, in both which Christ crucified, and the nature of his sufferings, had been fully and clearly set forth. Had they been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, by the ministration of the law, or on account of any works done by them in obedience thereto? Was it not by their hearing and embracing the doctrine of faith in Christ alone for justification? Which of these had God owned with tokens of his favour and acceptance? It was not by the first, but the last. And those must be very unwise, who suffer themselves to be turned away from the ministry and doctrine which have been blessed to their spiritual advantage. Alas, that men should turn from the all-important doctrine of Christ crucified, to listen to useless distinctions, mere moral preaching, or wild fancies! The god of this world, by various men and means, has blinded men's eyes, lest they should learn to trust in a crucified Saviour. We may boldly demand where the fruits of the Holy Spirit are most evidently brought forth? whether among those who preach justification by the works of the law, or those who preach the doctrine of faith? Assuredly among the latter.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He therefore that ministereth ... - This verse contains substantially a repetition of the argument in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a>. The argument is, that the gift of the Holy Spirit to them was not imparted in consequence of the observance of the Law of Moses, but in connection with the preaching of the gospel. By the word "he" in this place, Clarke, Doddridge, Bloomfield, Chandler, Locke and many others, suppose that the apostle means himself Bloomfield says, that it is the common opinion of "all the ancient commentators." But this seems to me a strange opinion. The obvious reference, it seems to me, is to God, who had furnished or imparted to them the remarkable influences of the Holy Spirit, and this had been done in connection with the preaching of the gospel, and not by the observance of the Law. If, however, it refers to Paul, it means that he had been made the agent or instrument in imparting to them those remarkable endowments, and that this had been done by one who had not enforced the necessity of obeying the Law of Moses, but who had preached to them the simple gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. He &#8230; that ministereth&#8212;or "supplieth," God (2Co 9:10). He who supplied and supplies to you the Spirit still, to the present time. These miracles do not prove grace to be in the heart (Mr 9:38, 39). He speaks of these miracles as a matter of unquestioned notoriety among those addressed; an undesigned proof of their genuineness (compare 1Co 12:1-31).<p>worketh miracles among you&#8212;rather, "IN you," as Ga 2:8; Mt 14:2; Eph 2:2; Php 2:13; at your conversion and since [Alford].<p>doeth he it by the works of the law&#8212;that is, as a consequence resulting from (so the Greek) the works of the law (compare Ga 3:2). This cannot be because the law was then unknown to you when you received those gifts of the Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He had asked them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm" title="This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:2</a></span>, whether they had received the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing the gospel? Some think what he saith here to be a continuation of the same argument, but it rather seems a new one: there he spake of their receiving the Spirit, here he speaks of the ministration of the Spirit. Some understand it of God, who gives his Holy Spirit to them that ask him, and who was the Author of those miraculous operations wrought by the Spirit. I should rather understand it of the ministers of the gospel, to whom God hath committed the ministration of the Spirit; and to some of whom God, in the primitive times, gave a power to work miracles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span> Doth God concur with our ministry upon our preaching the law, or upon our preaching the gospel? So that though there be a great cognation between the apostle’s arguing, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm" title="This only would I learn of you, Received you the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:2</a></span>, and his arguing in this verse, yet there is some difference; the apostle there arguing from the success of preaching the gospel, here from the ministration itself. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/galatians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit,.... By whom he means not himself, nor any other minister of the Gospel, in whose power it does not lie to minister the Spirit, either the ordinary or the extraordinary gifts of it unto men; but either God or Christ who had ministered, and still continued to minister the grace of the Spirit through the preaching of the Gospel; or rather the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, which were manifested at the first preaching of the Gospel to them for the confirmation of it, and which they were still supplied with, as the following words show: <p>and worketh miracles among you; so that this is a distinct argument from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a> and a further proof and aggravation of the folly and stupidity of the members of this church, who had not only received through the Gospel the Spirit, as a spirit of regeneration, at least many of them, but had seen the Gospel confirmed by the extraordinary gifts, signs, and wonders of the Holy Ghost, and which were still among them; and yet they were departing from this Gospel, through which all this was done: for it is asked, <p>doth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? and the apostle's meaning is, that these extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, and these miracles done among them, did not attend the preaching of the law, or the doctrine of justification by works, taught by the false apostles, but the doctrine of faith, of justification by faith in the righteousness of Christ, delivered by him and others, for the truth of which he appeals to themselves; and therefore they must be guilty of the most egregious folly, once to think of, or take anyone step towards a departure from that doctrine.

The argumentative treatment of this topic of the gift of the Spirit was interrupted in vers. 3 and 4 by curt, strongly emotional interrogatories, darted forth upon the apostle's recollecting the animated spirituality which marked those early days of their discipleship. The impassioned desultoriness of his language here, together with its abrupt, niggardly wording, is paralleled by <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-10.htm">Galatians 4:10-20</a>. Perhaps these features in the form of the composition were in part occasioned by the circumstance that he was writing this Epistle with his own hand and not through an amanuensis; such manual exertion being, it should seem, unusual with him, and from some cause even laborious and painful: and so from time to time he appears, as it were, laying down the pen, to rest, to quell emotion, to reflect. The compound verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, supply, differs probably from the simple form <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> only by indicating profusion in the supply; but this qualification of its meaning is too slight to be representable in translation. Besides <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5, 11</a>, we find it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>, "He that supplieth (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) seed...  shall supply (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) and multiply your seed for sowing;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>, "From whom all the body...  being supplied;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>, "As of the strength which God sup-plieth." And with similar application the substantive "supply" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-19.htm">Philippians 1:19</a>, "Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>, "Through every joint of the supply." These passages make it clear that "he that supplieth" is no other than God. And this conclusion is borne out by the comparing of the other clause, "<span class="accented">worketh</span> powers in you," with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-6.htm">1 Corinthians 12:6</a>, "It is the same God (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> who worketh all in all" (referring to the charismata) - which passage shows that "<span class="accented">powers</span>' (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) are not "<span class="accented">miracles"</span> themselves as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a> and Matthew 11:20, and often, but power to work miracles, the plural number pointing to the various forms of its manifestation, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10, 28, 29</a>. The apostle <span class="accented">uses</span> the present participles <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> as describing an agency which the Almighty was continually putting forth among believers in general, including the Galatian Churches themselves<span class="cmt_word">. Doeth he it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>;) <span class="accented">in consequence of works of the Law or of the hearing of faith</span>? With the sparingness of words above noted, the apostle barely jots down, so to speak, the <span class="accented">substance</span> of the interrogative dilemma, without filling in the <span class="accented">form</span> of the question. The suppletion would naturally be that of our version, "doeth he it." The substance of the argument apparently required no more than, as before, the question - Was it in consequence of works of the Law or of the hearing of faith that the Spirit and his wonder-working powers were received? But instead of putting it so, St. Paul interposes the personality of the great God himself as imparting these great gifts, making his sentence thereby the more stately and impressive: it is with God in the might of his working that these corrupters of the gospel have to reckon. The impartation of the Spirit and the charisms evidenced God's complacency in the recipients. On what was that complacency founded? on their earning it by ceremonial performances, or on their simply opening their hearts to receive his love? It was a question which the Galatian Churchmen might, if they would, see the answer to in experiences of their own. Among themselves these powers had appeared, and no doubt were still operative. "Well, then," says the apostle, "look and see: are they not operative in those only of you who had received them upon the mere acceptance of righteousness offered them through faith in Christ simply, without having given any heed to Mosaic ceremonialism? Have any of you received them after taking up with such ceremonialism?" The apostle, it will be observed - and the remark is one of no small importance - makes an appeal to simple matters of fact, founded upon his and their own familiar acquaintance with the facts, and defying contradiction. We may be sure, therefore, that the facts were as he indicates, however small the extent may be to which we, with our imperfect knowledge of the circumstances, are ourselves able to verify his statement. In some degree, however, we can. Besides the striking illustration afforded by what occurred in the house of Cornelius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>), we see that such charismata were bestowed, and in some instances, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> at Corinth, in exceeding great profusion, in the train of St. Paul's evangelizing ministrations; and how remote those ministrations were from the inculcation, or even the admission, among Gentile converts of Mosaic ceremonialism we know perfectly. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Therefore (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Resumes the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a> (<a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-3.htm">Galatians 3:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-4.htm">Galatians 3:4</a> being, practically, parenthetical), in order to adduce the example of Abraham as a proof of justification by faith. The thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a> is further emphasized. The gift of the Spirit, and the bestowment of miraculous powers, is a purely divine operation in believers, which is not merited by legal works, but can be received and experienced only through the message of faith.<p>He that ministereth (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Or supplieth.

The idea of abundant supply (Lightfoot), if conveyed at all, resides, not in the preposition &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768;, which indicates direction, but in the simple verb, which is used of abundant, liberal supply. He that ministereth is God.<p>Worketh (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>.<p>Miracles (&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20</a>. Either miracles, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>, or miraculous powers, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-6.htm">1 Corinthians 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>. The analogy of these latter passages favors the second meaning.<p>Among you (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>So, if &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; is explained as miracles.
