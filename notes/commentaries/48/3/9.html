The same idea is presented in two different forms.

This he does from the example of Abraham, whose faith fastened upon the word and promise of God, and upon his believing he was owned and accepted of God as a righteous man. The Scripture is said to foresee, because the Holy Spirit that indited the Scripture did foresee. Through faith in the promise of God he was blessed; and it is only in the same way that others obtain this privilege. Let us then study the object, nature, and effects of Abraham's faith; for who can in any other way escape the curse of the holy law? The curse is against all sinners, therefore against all men; for all have sinned, and are become guilty before God: and if, as transgressors of the law, we are under its curse, it must be vain to look for justification by it. Those only are just or righteous who are freed from death and wrath, and restored into a state of life in the favour of God; and it is only through faith that persons become righteous. Thus we see that justification by faith is no new doctrine, but was taught in the church of God, long before the times of the gospel. It is, in truth, the only way wherein any sinners ever were, or can be justified. Though deliverance is not to be expected from the law, there is a way open to escape the curse, and regain the favour of God, namely, through faith in Christ. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law; being made sin, or a sin-offering, for us, he was made a curse for us; not separated from God, but laid for a time under the Divine punishment. The heavy sufferings of the Son of God, more loudly warn sinners to flee from the wrath to come, than all the curses of the law; for how can God spare any man who remains under sin, seeing that he spared not his own Son, when our sins were charged upon him? Yet at the same time, Christ, as from the cross, freely invites sinners to take refuge in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So then they which be of faith - They whose leading characteristic it is that they believe.

This is the apostle's conclusion upon the whole, from the instance of Abraham, and, the promise made to him; and is an explanation of the preceding clause, and shows that it must be taken in a limited sense, and understood not of every individual; only of those who are of the same faith with Abraham, are believers in Christ, and seek for justification by faith in him, and not by the works of the law: <p>these are blessed with faithful Abraham; in his seed Christ; they are blessed with a justifying righteousness in Christ as he was, and will be blessed with eternal life as he is; they shall sit with him, and with Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. The character of "faithful" given to him, respects not his uprightness and integrity among men, but his faith in God; and does not suppose that he was blessed for his faith, but that it was through faith that he received the blessing of justification, and not by the works of the law; and that in the same way, all that believe enjoy the same favour, for to them it is limited and restrained: nor can the Jews of all men find fault with this interpretation of the apostle's, since they themselves interpret the above clause of some particular persons of the nations of the world, and say in so many words, that <p>"the meaning is, not that all the men of the world should be blessed, but that every family that is in the world,  , "that comes to the obedience and faith of him" (God,) to it shall adhere the blessing and providence.

The apostle gathers from the words cited in ver. 8 the two particulars, that there are who get to be blessed like Abraham and with him, and that it is by faith like Abraham's, without works of the Law, that they do so. He seems to have an eye to the sense of Divine benediction which the Galatians had themselves experienced, when upon their simply believing in Christ the Spirit's gifts had been poured forth upon them. The word "faithful" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>) is inserted, <span class="accented">ex abundanti</span> almost, to mark the more explicitly and emphatically, the condition on which both Abraham and therefore others in him gain the blessing. This being "in Abraham," which is here predicated of all who gain justification and God's benediction, is analogous to the image of Gentiles, being by faith "grafted," and by faith abiding, in the "olive tree," which we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17, 20</a>. The verbal <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is generally passive, "one to be believed <span class="accented">or</span> trusted in," and so a man "of fidelity;" but it is also at times active, in the sense of "one who believes," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-45.htm">Acts 10:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-15.htm">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-16.htm">1 Timothy 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a> (so in <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-30.htm">Matthew 6:30</a>).
