By no means. The Law could not indeed give life; it could not justify, or place in a state of righteousness. Its real result was rather to place all men in a state of sin. But by so doing it prepared the way for the fulfilment of the promise in all who put faith in Christ. The Law was a close and strict, yet salutary, discipline to make us fit for faith in Christ.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">The promises.</span>—Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm" title="Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He said not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.">Galatians 3:16</a>, the plural, because the promise to Abraham was several times repeated, and afterwards ratified to his descendants.<p><span class= "bld">For if . . .</span>—The argument which follows begins with a concession.

That the Law could not justify had been shown in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God?

On the contrary, it was intended to be subservient to the promise, by leading those who were under it to a higher and better dispensation, by subjecting them to the curse, without giving them the least hope of mercy, to oblige them to flee to the promises for justification. <span class="ital">For if there had been a law given which could have given life </span>— Either spiritual or eternal; if any law, considered in itself alone, could have been a sufficient mean of justification and eternal happiness, then <span class="ital">verily righteousness </span>— Justification, and the blessings consequent thereon; would <span class="ital">have been by the </span>Mosaic <span class="ital">law </span>— Which is so holy, just, and good in all its moral precepts. By this the apostle shows that the law of Moses was utterly incapable of giving the Jews life and salvation; because, considered in itself, independent of the covenant of grace, it neither promised them the pardon of sin on their repentance, nor the influences of the divine Spirit to enable them to overcome and mortify the corruption of their nature; and of consequence, neither gave them a title to, nor a meetness for, eternal life. Justification, therefore, was not to be obtained by that law. On the contrary, <span class="ital">the Scripture </span>— Wherein that law is written; <span class="ital">hath concluded all under sin </span>— Hath shut them up together, (so the word <span class="greekheb">συνεκλεισεν </span>properly signifies,) as in a prison, under sentence of death; that is, hath declared them all to be so shut up; <span class="ital">that the promise </span>— That is, the blessing of life and salvation, promised through <span class="ital">faith </span>in <span class="ital">Jesus Christ, might be </span>freely <span class="ital">given to them that </span>truly <span class="ital">believe </span>in him, and in the truths and promises of his gospel.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:19-22 If that promise was enough for salvation, wherefore then serveth the law? The Israelites, though chosen to be God's peculiar people, were sinners as well as others. The law was not intended to discover a way of justification, different from that made known by the promise, but to lead men to see their need of the promise, by showing the sinfulness of sin, and to point to Christ, through whom alone they could be pardoned and justified. The promise was given by God himself; the law was given by the ministry of angels, and the hand of a mediator, even Moses. Hence the law could not be designed to set aside the promise. A mediator, as the very term signifies, is a friend that comes between two parties, and is not to act merely with and for one of them. The great design of the law was, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to those that believe; that, being convinced of their guilt, and the insufficiency of the law to effect a righteousness for them, they might be persuaded to believe on Christ, and so obtain the benefit of the promise. And it is not possible that the holy, just, and good law of God, the standard of duty to all, should be contrary to the gospel of Christ. It tends every way to promote it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is the law then against the promises of God? - Is the Law of Moses to be regarded as opposed to the promises made to Abraham? Does this follow from any view which can be taken of the subject? The object of the apostle in asking this question is, evidently, to take an opportunity to deny in the most positive manner that there can be any such clashing or contradiction. He shows, therefore, what was the design of the Law, and declares that the object was to further the plan contemplated in the promise made to Abraham. It was an auxiliary to that. It was as good as a law could be; and it was designed to prepare the way for the fulfillment of the promise made to Abraham.<p>God forbid - It cannot be. It is impossible. I do not hold such an opinion. Such a sentiment by no means follows from what has been advanced; compare the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>.<p>For if there had been a law given which could have given life - The Law of Moses is as good as a law can be. It is pure, and truly, and good. It is not the design to insinuate anything against the Law in itself, or to say that as a law it is defective. But law could not give life. It is not its nature; and man cannot be justified by obedience to it. No man has ever yielded perfect compliance with it and no man, therefore, can be justified by it, compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>, note.<p>Verily righteousness should have been by the law - Or justification would have been secured by the Law. The Law of Moses was as well adapted to this as a law could be. No better law could have been originated for this purpose, and if people were to attempt to justify themselves before God by their own works, the Law of Moses would be as favorable for such an undertaking as any law which could be revealed. It is as reasonable, and equal, and pure. Its demands are as just, and its terms as favorable as could be any of the terms of mere law. And such a law has been given in part in order to show that justification by the Law is out of the question. If people could not be justified by a law so pure, and equal, and just; so reasonable in all its requirements and so perfect, how could they expect to be justified by conformity to any inferior or less perfect rule of life? The fact, therefore, that no one can be justified by the pure law revealed on Mount Sinai, forever settles the question about the possibility of being justified by law. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

God forbid."<p>life&#8212;The law, as an externally prescribed rule, can never internally impart spiritual life to men naturally dead in sin, and change the disposition. If the law had been a law capable of giving life, "verily (in very reality, and not in the mere fancy of legalists) righteousness would have been by the law (for where life is, there righteousness, its condition, must also be)." But the law does not pretend to give life, and therefore not righteousness; so there is no opposition between the law and the promise.

If the law was added because of transgressions, and curses for them, and if the inheritance is not of it, but by promise, were it, it would not be by promise, then, says an objector, it is against the promises: these are contrary to one another, and God, in giving the one and the other, must contradict himself: to which it is replied, <p>God forbid; a way of speaking the apostle uses, when he would express his abhorrence and detestation of anything, as here; for though the law and promises are distinct things, and have their separate uses, yet they are not contradictory to each other; the law has its use, and so have the promises; the promises do not set aside the law as useless on all accounts, nor does the law disannul the promises, but is subservient to them: <p>for if there had been a law which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law; but the law cannot give life, spiritual life to a dead sinner; God only can do this, Father, Son, and Spirit; so far is the law from giving it efficiently, that it is not so much as the means of it; it is not made use of this way; God makes use of the law to kill, but not to make alive; he makes use of the law to strike dead all a man's hopes of happiness, by the deeds of it; but it is the Gospel he uses to quicken and comfort; that is the Spirit that giveth life. The law requires as much of a dead sinner, as it did of Adam in innocence, but gives him no life, activity, and strength to perform; could it quicken him, and enable him to do all its demands perfectly, then there would be righteousness, and so justification by it, as by the promise; whence it appears that there is no contrariety in the law to the promises: the reason why there is no righteousness is, because it cannot give life, spiritual life and strength; and if so, then not eternal life; which is the free gift of God, and not the merit of men's works: this is directly contrary to a notion of the Jews, who cry up the law as a life giving law; say they (n), <p>"great is the law,   , "for it giveth life to them that do it", in this world, and in the world to come:'' <p>and elsewhere (o), <p>"the law is a tree of life to all that study in it, <p> , "to give unto them life" in this world, and "to give unto them life" in the world to come.'' <p>(n) Pirke Abot, c. 6. sect. 6.

But it would abolish them if it gave life, for by that means it would justify, and therefore it would abolish that justification which was promised to Abraham and to his seed by faith. No, it was rather given to bring to light the guiltiness of all men, to the end that all believers fleeing to Christ, might be freely justified in him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/galatians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God?

In view of the continuity of divine providence the suggestion that the Law contravened or nullified the previous covenant of God with Abraham and the patriarchs is dismissed as monstrous. It was incompatible with the faithfulness of God to His pledged word, and is therefore repudiated with the customary formula <span class="greekheb">μὴ γένοιτο</span>. The apparent sanction given by the Law to a new method of justification (<span class="ital">viz.</span>, by works) could lead to no actual result, unless it had at the same time possessed the power which it lacked of quickening spiritual life.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>. These words are omitted in some MSS., but the preponderance of authority is in favour of their retention. The sense is the same whether they be expressed or understood. The addition may perhaps be due to a marginal comment which found its way into the text.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. Having thus sharply contrasted the two covenants, the Apostle anticipates an objection—‘You say that God is One. He is the Author both of the law and of the promises. How then can there be the opposition between them which your argument would imply?’ To this the answer is decisive. The difference is such as to display a marked contrast, not such as to involve antagonism. Otherwise God might seem in giving the law to have retracted the promises. Away with such a supposition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for if there had been a law given … by the law</span>] Life had been forfeited by sin; life must be recovered by righteousness. The <span class="ital">promise</span> assured life to the believer through righteousness imputed; the <span class="ital">law</span> offered life as the reward of a perfect obedience. Had the conditions of the law been less strict, or had man been able to fulfil them, then righteousness (and life) had come to men from the law. Hence there is no antagonism between the two covenants. ‘To give life’ was the end of both. The law failed to do this; the promise succeeded.

The answer is, that the law is not against the promises, and in regard to the answer two considerations are presented: The one is, the law in itself, though it were willing, cannot give the life that has been promised, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, truly righteousness should have been by the law.">Galatians 3:21</a>; the other is, nevertheless, as a schoolmaster, it assisted the promise of life; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-22.htm" title="But the scripture has concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.">Galatians 3:22</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-7.htm" title="Why you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.">Galatians 4:7</a>. The first consideration is proved by this Enthymeme[29] (of the same sort as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-18.htm" title="For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.">Galatians 3:18</a>): If the law could give you life, righteousness would be by the law; but righteousness is not by the law; supply [the conclusion], therefore the law cannot give life. The major proposition is evident, for only the just shall live, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a>.

The law offers life conditionally, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-12.htm" title="And the law is not of faith: but, The man that does them shall live in them.">Galatians 3:12</a>; but does not confer it, because it cannot, being deprived of all power to do so by sin.—<span class="greekheb">ὄντως</span>, <span class="ital">verily</span>) not merely in the opinion of those maintaining justification by works.

"Against" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>), as <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-23.htm">Galatians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-30.htm">Matthew 12:30</a>. Since the apostle has already (vers. 15-18) disposed of the notion that the Law may have superseded or essentially qualified the promise, this word "against" can hardly intend adverse action of that kind, but rather imports simply contrariety of spirit or purpose. This objection the apostle meets by stating that the spirit and purpose of the Law were not contrary to the promises, inasmuch as the Law did not offer to interfere with the work which the promises were to do, but was designed, to be auxiliary to their function by preparing the way for its discharge. <span class="cmt_word">God forbid</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). The tone of abhorrence with which the apostle negatives the inference (see note on Galatians 2:17) is due, not so much to its mere unreasonableness, as to the almost blasphemous character which he feels to attach to the notion. To think that one unquestionable revelation of the faithful, unchangeable God can be contrary in spirit or purpose to another equally unquestionable revelation of his! <span class="cmt_word">For if there had been a Law given which could have given life</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>,); <span class="accented">for if a Law had been given such as could make alive.</span> The construction of the article in the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is similar to that in <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-41.htm">Acts 10:41</a>). The noun is first put undetermined, a narrowing determination with the article being then added: "If [in the Law of Moses] had been given a Law such as," etc. By fastening attention upon the Law as unable "to make alive," the apostle marks its character as contrasted with the new covenant, the characteristic function of which is that of imparting a life-giving Spirit. The Law made men feel their sin, their spiritual incapacitation, "the body of death" which enthralled them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>.); but the grace which should instil into their souls the life of love which they lacked, it had not to bestow. So far only reaches the unfavourable estimate of the Law's function given here: it was not "able to make alive." <span class="cmt_word">Verily righteousness should have been by the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">in very deed then from the Law would have accrued righteousness.</span> "In very deed then." But as the case now stands, it is a delusion to think it can, as the unbelieving Jews do, and as some of you seem minded to do. <span class="greek">&#x1f4c;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-25.htm">1 Corinthians 14:25</a>. If the Law could have quickened men with spiritual life it would have brought them justification. This is what the apostle here affirms. But why so? That in the economy of grace there is no justification without spiritual quickening, nor spiritual life without justification, we are clearly apprised by many passages of St. Paul's own writings, notably by <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-10</a>. The explanation, however, is probably this: in the apostle's view, the gift of the indwelling Spirit, to sanctify us and enable us for living a spiritual life, is conditioned by a state of acceptableness with God; until we have been brought into a state of grace, we are not qualified to receive this the supreme proof of Divine love. It is "because we are sons that God sends the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). If, then, the Law can be supposed capable of imparting the Spirit of life, it must be supposed capable of antecedently imparting righteousness. The "inheritance" of Abraham's seed includes both, both accruing to them from faith. So far was the Law from having these gifts to bestrew, that on the one hand, Moses' ministering of the Law to the people was a ministration of condemnation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6-9</a>), and on the other, it brought quickening, indeed, but  not to the sinner's spirit, but to his sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9</a>). intensifying its malignity and working death (ibid., vers. 10-13). These views, so explicitly expressed by the apostle in the two nearly contemporaneous Epistles just cited, reveal to us what was in his mind when writing, the words before us, and may be properly adduced to explain them. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Against the promises (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Does it follow from the difference between the law and the promises that they are in antagonism?

This could only be true in case the law gave life, for life must come either through the promises or through the law. If the law is against the promises, and makes them invalid, it follows that life must come through the law, and therefore righteousness, without which there is no life, would verily (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;), just as the Judaisers claim, be through the law.<p>By the law<p>Tisch., Rev.
