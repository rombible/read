When he saw that Peter and the others did not live up to that principle which the gospel taught, and which they professed, namely, That by the death of Christ the partition wall between Jew and Gentile was taken down, and the observance of the law of Moses was no longer in force; as Peter's offence was public, he publicly reproved him. There is a very great difference between the prudence of St. Paul, who bore with, and used for a time, the ceremonies of the law as not sinful, and the timid conduct of St. Peter, who, by withdrawing from the Gentiles, led others to think that these ceremonies were necessary.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the other Jews - That is, those who had been converted to Christianity.

That is, they attempted to conceal from those who had come down from James the fact that they had been in the habit of associating with the Gentiles, and of eating with them. From this it would appear that they intended to conceal this wholly from them, and that they withdrew from the Gentiles before anything had been said to them by those who came down from James.<p>Insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away ... - Concerning Barnabas, see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>. Barnabas was the intimate friend of Paul. He had been associated with him in very important labors; and the fact, therefore, that the conduct of Peter was exciting so unhappy an influence as even to lead so worthy and good a man as he was into hypocrisy and error, made it the more proper that Paul should publicly notice and reprove the conduct of Peter. It could not but be a painful duty, but the welfare of the church and the cause of religion demanded it, and Paul did not shrink from what was so obvious a duty. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. the other&#8212;Greek, "the rest."<p>Jews&#8212;Jewish Christians.<p>dissembled likewise&#8212;Greek, "joined in hypocrisy," namely, in living as though the law were necessary to justification, through fear of man, though they knew from God their Christian liberty of eating with Gentiles, and had availed themselves of it already (Ac 11:2-17). The case was distinct from that in 1Co 8:1-10:33; Ro 14:1-23. It was not a question of liberty, and of bearing with others' infirmities, but one affecting the essence of the Gospel, whether the Gentiles are to be virtually "compelled to live as do the Jews," in order to be justified (Ga 2:14).<p>Barnabas also&#8212;"Even Barnabas": one least likely to be led into such an error, being with Paul in first preaching to the idolatrous Gentiles: showing the power of bad example and numbers. In Antioch, the capital of Gentile Christianity and the central point of Christian missions, the controversy first arose, and in the same spot it now broke out afresh; and here Paul had first to encounter the party that afterwards persecuted him in every scene of his labors (Ac 15:30-35).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The fact was the worse, because those Christians which were of the church of Antioch, having been native Jews, followed his example, and made a separate party with him.

This was <span class="ital">hypocrisy</span> on their part and on Peter’s, because, although at the bottom of their hearts convinced of Christian freedom, they, from fear of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.">Galatians 2:12</a>), concealed the more liberal conviction of which they were conscious, and behaved just as if they entertained the opposite view. It is true that the apostolic council had not decided anything as to the conduct of the Jewish Christians among Gentile Christians; but the immorality consisted in the inwardly untrue <span class="ital">duplicity</span> of their behaviour, which was more than a mere <span class="ital">inconsistency</span> (Baur) of reformed Judaism, <span class="ital">conceived</span> by Paul as being hypocrisy (Hilgenfeld).

It is emphatically prefixed. The dative is <span class="ital">instrumental: by</span> their hypocrisy, not <span class="ital">to</span> their hypocrisy (Luther and others). No one can, without wronging Paul in respect to the choice of his strongly inculpating expression,[88] either <span class="ital">call in question</span> the fact that the conduct of <span class="ital">Peter</span> is here expressly designated as <span class="ital">hypocrisy</span> (Schwegler, I. p. 129), or reduce it to a mere <span class="ital">supposition;</span> although Ritschl, p. 145, is of opinion that the reproach thus used does not quite evince a clear and thorough conviction of the rightness of the non-Jewish practice. The purposely chosen expression in our passage shows, on the contrary, that <span class="ital">Peter’s conviction, which was well known to Paul</span>, agreed with the conviction of Paul himself, although it was <span class="ital">hypocritically denied</span> by the former. Peter’s <span class="greekheb">ὑπόκρισις</span>, according to the text, consisted in the <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαΐζειν</span>, to which he had drawn back after his intercourse with the Gentile Christians, not in his previous fellowship with them, which is alleged to have been “a momentary unfaithfulness to his real conviction” (Baur, in the <span class="ital">theol. Jahrb</span>. 1849, p. 476; Schwegler, Zeller, Hilgenfeld). And the censure which Paul—certainly unwillingly, and with a complete realizing and appreciating of the moral situation to which it has reference—has directed against Peter expressly on the ground of <span class="ital">hypocrisy</span>,[89] exhibits plainly the agreement in principle of the personal convictions of the two apostles (comp. Wiesinger, <span class="ital">de consensu, locor. Gal</span>. ii. <span class="ital">et Act</span>. xv. p. 36; Lechler, p. 426).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[88] This expression is all the more strictly to be understood as it stands, since Paul has not anywhere else in his epistles or speeches used either the word <span class="greekheb">ὑποκρίνεσθαι</span>, or <span class="greekheb">ὑποκριτής</span>, or (with the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-2.htm" title="Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;">1 Timothy 4:2</a>) <span class="greekheb">ὑπόκρισις</span>. He would be the less likely to have omitted to weigh the gravity of the reproach conveyed in this very word otherwise strange to him, especially seeing that it was used after so <span class="ital">long</span> a time and was directed against <span class="ital">Peter</span>. This remark also applies in opposition to Schneckenburger in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.

The men who had hitherto eaten with the uncircumcised and now withdrew because they shrank from giving offence were, in fact, affecting religious scruples which they did not feel, and the Apostle does not hesitate to denounce such insincerity by its true name <span class="ital">hypocrisy</span>.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ Βαρνάβας</span>: <span class="ital">even Barnabas</span>. The defection of Barnabas was a heavier blow to the cause of Gentile freedom than the vacillation of Peter. With the single exception of Paul himself, Barnabas had been the most effective minister of Christ for the conversion of Greeks; he had been of late deputed to appear with Paul as their representative in Jerusalem, and his withdrawal from social communion with Greek Christians fell upon them with the force of a betrayal. Yet Paul, who had been for many years his most intimate companion, and knew his heart, writes more in sorrow than in anger of his lamentable weakness in being led away by evil example. For he saw that he was the victim of stronger wills than his own. Jerusalem had been his early home and the place of his earliest ministry. The Twelve had been his first teachers in Christ: his cousin John Mark, who was even then in Antioch, was so dear to him that Barnabas, when driven to choose between him and Paul, chose Mark for the companion of his future ministry. What wonder then that he was tempted on this occasion for a moment to yield to the influence of Peter and the brethren from Jerusalem!<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">dissembled likewise with him</span>] Lit. practised like hypocrisy.
