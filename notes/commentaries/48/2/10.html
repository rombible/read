St. Paul had already been the means of bringing contributions from the wealthier churches of Antioch to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/11-29.htm" title="Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:">Acts 11:29-30</a>). This seems to have been gracefully received, not only as an act of charity, but as a recognition of the claims of the mother Church. The Apostles expressed a hope that the same good feeling might continue, to which St. Paul willingly assented. That he did not forget his promise appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm" title="Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.">Acts 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-3.htm" title="And when I come, whomsoever you shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality to Jerusalem.">1Corinthians 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;">2Corinthians 8:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:">2Corinthians 9:1</a> <span class= "ital">et sea.</span> (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/15-25.htm" title="But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.">Romans 15:25-27</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Observe the apostle's faithfulness in giving a full account of the doctrine he had preached among the Gentiles, and was still resolved to preach, that of Christianity, free from all mixture of Judaism. This doctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it. His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened, or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon God for success to our labours, we should use every proper caution to remove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which may lawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done without betraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give place to any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflected upon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not receive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them. Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he was designed to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves. They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind of Christ, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is not ours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this we are to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, and how ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though many would scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; but mere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not help them. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extend to all the disciples of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Only they would that we should remember the poor - That is, as I suppose, the poor Christians in Judea. It can hardly be supposed that it would be necessary to make this an express stipulation in regard to the converts from among the Gentiles, and it would not have been very pertinent to the case before them to have done so. The object was, to bind together the Christians from among the pagan and from among the Jews, and to prevent alienation and unkind feeling. It might have been alleged that Paul was disposed to forget his own countrymen altogether; that he regarded himself as so entirely the apostle of the Gentiles that he would become wholly alienated from those who were his "kinsmen according to the flesh," and thus it might be apprehended that unpleasant feelings would be engendered among those who had been converted from among the Jews. Now nothing could be better adapted to allay this than for him to pledge himself to feel a deep interest in the poor saints among the Jewish converts; to remember them in his prayers; and to endeavor to secure contributions for their needs.<p>Thus he would show that he was not alienated from his countrymen; and thus the whole church would be united in the closest bonds. It is probable that the Christians in Judea were at that time suffering the ills of poverty arising either from some public persecution, or from the fact that they were subject to the displeasure of their countrymen. All who know the special feelings of the Jews at that time in regard to Christians, must see at once that many of the followers of Jesus of Nazareth would be subjected to great inconveniences on account of their attachment to him. Many a wife might be disowned by her husband; many a child disinherited by a parent; many a man might be thrown out of employment by the fact that others would not countenance him; and hence, many of the Christians would be poor. It became, therefore, an object of special importance to provide for them; and hence, this is so often referred to in the New Testament. In addition to this, the church in Judea was afflicted with famine; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25-27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1-2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1-7</a>.<p>The same which I also was forward to do - See the passages just referred to. Paul interested himself much in the collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, and in this way he furnished the fullest evidence that he was not alienated from them, but that he felt the deepest interest in those who were his kindred. One of the proper ways of securing union in the church is to have the poor with them and depending on them for support; and hence, every church has some poor persons as one of the bonds of union. The best way to unite all Christians, and to prevent alienation, and jealousy, and strife, is to have a great common object of charity, in which all are interested and to which all may contribute. Such a common object for all Christians is a sinful world. All who bear the Christian name may unite in promoting its salvation, and nothing would promote union in the now divided and distracted church of Christ like a deep and common interest in the salvation of all mankind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. remember the poor&#8212;of the Jewish Christians in Judea, then distressed.

Not in a spiritual sense, as some have thought, though these the apostle was greatly mindful of; but properly and literally the poor as to the things of this world; and may design the poor in general, everywhere, in the several churches where they should be called to minister, and particularly the poor saints at Jerusalem; who were become such, either through the frequent calamities of the nation, and a dearth or scarcity of provisions among them, and which affected the whole country; or rather through the persecutions of their countrymen, who plundered them of their goods for professing the name of Christ; or it may be through their having given up all their substance into one common stock and fund, as they did at first, and which was now exhausted, and that in a great measure by assisting out of it the preachers who first spread the Gospel among the Gentiles; so that it was but just that they should make some return unto them, and especially for the spiritual favours they received from them, as the Gospel, and the ministers of it, which first went out of Jerusalem: the "remembering" of them not only intends giving them actual assistance according to their abilities, which was very small, but mentioning their case to the several Gentile churches, and stirring them up to a liberal contribution: <p>the same which I also was forward to do; as abundantly appears from his epistles to the churches, and especially from his two epistles to the Corinthians. Now since the apostles at Jerusalem desired nothing else but this, and said not a word concerning the observance of the rites and ceremonies of the law, and neither found fault with, nor added to the Gospel the apostle communicated to them, it was a clear case that there was an entire agreement between them, in principle and practice, and that he did not receive his Gospel from them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/galatians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/galatians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a>.

The <span class="ital">poverty</span> of the Christians <span class="ital">of Palestine</span>, which was the principal motive for this proviso being added, finds its explanation in the persecutions which they underwent, in the community of goods which they had at first, and perhaps also in the expectation of the <span class="ital">Parousia</span> as near which they most of all cherished. Moreover, the <span class="greekheb">μόνον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. by no means excludes the ordinances of the apostolic council, for Paul here has in view nothing but his recognition as apostle on the part of the original apostles in the private discussions held with the latter.

In the face of real antagonism of doctrine, the older apostles certainly would not have tendered Paul their hands; and had they desired to do so, Paul would have refused them his.[82]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὃ καὶ ἐσπούδασα αὐτὸ τοῦτο ποιῆσαι</span>] The aorist, not used instead of the pluperfect, relates to the time from that apostolic alliance to the composition of the epistle. Paul, however, continues in the <span class="ital">singular;</span> for soon afterwards he separated himself from Barnabas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-39.htm" title="And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;">Acts 15:39</a>). So, correctly, Estius, Winer, Usteri, Schott. Those who identify our journey with that related in Acts 11, 12 must conclude, with Fritzsche, that Paul desired to report <span class="ital">concerning himself</span>, and hence only mentioned Barnabas (and Titus) as well, <span class="ital">where it was necessary</span>. Nevertheless this joint-mention, although not <span class="ital">necessary</span>, would have been very <span class="ital">natural</span> in our passage; for <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μνημονεύωμεν</span> had just been said, and then in a single stroke of the representation, with <span class="greekheb">ὃ καὶ ἐσπούδασα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., is given the conclusion of the matter so referred to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span>] is not superfluous (Piscator, Vorstius, Grotius, Morus), as neither <span class="greekheb">αὐτό</span> alone (Winer, p. 140) nor <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> alone (see Matthiae, p. 1050; Kühner, II. p. 527) is used; it is the emphatic epexegesis of <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span>, <span class="ital">hoc ipsum</span> (see Bornemann, <span class="ital">Schol. in Luc</span>. p. LIII.), whereby Paul makes his readers feel the contrast between the Jewish Christian <span class="ital">antagonism</span> and his <span class="ital">zeal of love</span> thus shown. Studer and Usteri find in <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span> the tacit antithesis, “but nothing further which the apostles had imposed on me.” Inappropriately, for the idea of any other matters imposed was already excluded by the previous account. Schott proposes to take <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> as <span class="greekheb">διʼ ὅ</span> (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-16.htm" title="But rise, and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of these things which you have seen, and of those things in the which I will appear to you;">Acts 26:16</a>), but the assumption of this poetical use cannot be justified except by a necessity such as is presented to us in the N.T. only at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-16.htm" title="But rise, and stand on your feet: for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of these things which you have seen, and of those things in the which I will appear to you;">Acts 26:16</a>. Still more easily might <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸ τοῦτο</span> be explained (Poppo, <span class="ital">ad Xen. Cyrop</span>. iv. 1. 21; Matthiae, p. 1041; Stallbaum, <span class="ital">ad Plat.

But in that case <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> would so naturally take up what preceded, that there would be no reason why Paul should have brought <span class="ital">on that very account</span> so prominently forward. It would rather have the appearance of suggesting that, if it had not been for the agreement in question, Paul would <span class="ital">not</span> have cared for the poor.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">We have no historical vouchers</span> for the truth of <span class="greekheb">ὃ καὶ ἐσπούδασα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; for the conveyance of the contributions in Acts 11 took place earlier than our journey; and the collection mentioned 1 Corinthians 16., 2 Corinthians 8 f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-27.htm" title="It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are.

But who would be inclined to doubt that assurance? Looking at the more or less fragmentary accounts in Acts and the Pauline epistles, who knows how often Paul may have sent pecuniary assistance to Palestine? as indeed he may have brought the like with him on occasion of his own journey, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/18-20.htm" title="When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;...">Acts 18:20-22</a>. It has, however, been wrongly asserted that, by means of this obligation in respect to the poor, a connection was intended to be maintained between the Gentile churches and the primitive church, and that at the bottom of it lay the wish <span class="ital">to bring over the preliminarily converted Gentiles gradually more and more to the principles and the mode of life of the primitive church</span> (Hilgenfeld, in his <span class="ital">Zeitschr</span>. 1860, p. 141).

These words are displaced from their grammatical position after <span class="greekheb">μνημονεύωμεν</span> in order to lay stress upon the poor being the central object of the appeal. Judæa suffered often from famine in apostolic times, and Christians were probably the worst sufferers owing to religious ill-will and social persecution. This passage implies chronic poverty. So also does the history of the Pauline contribution, which was not an effort to meet a special emergency, for it took more than a year to collect, but a fund organised to meet a permanent demand for systematic help.—<span class="greekheb">ὃ</span>. The addition of <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> after <span class="greekheb">αὐτό</span> shows that <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> is not the object of <span class="greekheb">ποιῆσαι</span>, but is used with adverbial force for a connecting particle, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm" title="Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.">Galatians 1:7</a>, <span class="ital">as for which</span>.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐσπούδασα</span>: not <span class="ital">I also</span>, for this would require <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐγώ</span> in the Greek text.

If there is the ellipsis of any participle at all which needs to be supplied, which many critics suppose, though Meyer not unplausibly thinks otherwise, perhaps "stipulating" presents itself more readily than either "willing" or "requesting;" for this <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> depends as much upon the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> as the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> does, and therefore seems to introduce something as much as that a part of the compact. What the apostle means is this: "In one respect only did this mutual compact of equal brotherly partnership leave us who were ministers of the Gentiles unfree in relation to the circumcision and their ministers; we consented to allow ourselves bound to be mindful of the duty of helping their poor. In all other respects, we were to still pursue the same plan of evangelization as we had been pursuing, with no modification of either our doctrine or Church practice; with no such modification, for example, as these false brethren were clamouring for." St. Paul's methods of work thus received the full sanction of the "pillars," being recognized by them as standing on the same level of truth and heavenly guidance as their own. <span class="cmt_word">The same which I also was forward to do</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">the very thing this which I was even of myself zealous to do.</span> The as; makes prominent the notion of intense earnestness, which St. Paul is wont to express in the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, as well as of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. He did not merely <span class="accented">consent to</span> bear in mind the poor of Judaea; apart from such stipulation, apart from regard to any request of James, Cephas, and John, it was a matter which of himself he regarded as one of very great importance, demanding his most earnest attention. The especial force of this verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> is evinced by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>; and especially by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16, 17</a>, in which the frame of mind it expresses is distinguished, as here, from that of mere willingness to consent to another person's request. The principal reason for making this matter so prominent lay, no doubt, in the great distress prevailing amongst the poor in Judaea, justifying the application of the principle stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14, 15</a> (see Stanley's note on 1 Corinthians 16:1). But we can hardly err in supposing that, as a subsidiary motive, both the leaders of the Jewish Church and St. Paul himself were greatly influenced by the consideration that such practical manifestation of Christian sympathy would both evince, and help to cement, the unity with each other of the Jewish and Gentile Churches. It was this organic unity which constituted the <span class="accented">obligation</span> of rendering such assistance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17, 18</a>). How perseveringly and how earnestly the apostle strove to aid the poor of the Jewish Churches both before and after the conference here spoken of, is seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29, 30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a> (where reference is made to collections in Galatia); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>. Since in this last cited passage it is only incidentally that St. Luke is led to mention the collection which St. Paul brought with him in that journey of his to Jerusalem recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-17.htm">Acts 21:17</a>, it is quite supposable that he brought collections with him also in that former visit merely glanced at in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>. We may surmise that St. Paul has a special purpose in mentioning to the Galatians this particular item of that important compact. In his First Epistle to the Corinthians, written at no long interval whether before or after the sending of this letter, he tells them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>) that he had given order to the Churches of Galatia respecting the manner in which <span class="accented">they</span> should collect for this object. It seems the more probable supposition that those directions were not given until this letter had had the happy effect of restoring better relations between himself and them than he was able at present to reckon upon. Meanwhile, however, this historical reference would serve to prepare them in some measure for the appeal, when he should think it  prudent to make it (cf. Introduction, pp. 16-18.). It is well to observe, in reference to this whole passage (vers. 6-10), the extent to which the apostle goes in identifying Barnabas's position with his own. Barnabas had laboured with himself as evangelizing "apostle" sent forth with himself from the Antiochian Church, and both before and. after that missionary journey in the neighbourhood of Antioch itself. Accordingly he tells his readers that the "pillars" had without qualification recognized the work of them both and had fraternally greeted their further prosecution of it. But it is of himself alone that he speaks when he contrasts Cephas's apostleship of the circumcision with his own apostleship (for this is implied) to the Gentiles. The reason for this is that Barnabas was not an apostle in that other higher sense of the term in which Cephas and himself were (see Introduction, Dissertation I.). Again, when mentioning the stipulation which the "pillars" made, that we should be mindful of their poor, he does not add, "the very thing this which we were of ourselves resolved to do," but makes the observation with reference to himself only. This is explained by the unhappy rupture which St. Luke tells of as so soon after occurring between them - which account of St. Luke's finds thus here a latent confirmation. What we otherwise know of Barnabas's character leaves no room to doubt but that he too zealously set himself to carry out the stipulation in that separate sphere of work among Gentiles which, after the rupture, he engaged in. But this is no longer St. Paul's business, while relating facts falling under his own cognizance. And this consideration throws light upon the time of the action expressed by the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>: it does not mean, "I <span class="accented">had already before been</span> forward to do so;" for then he would not have left out Barnabas; but, "thenceforward in my whole subsequent career I zealously made it my business," the aorist embracing the whole in one view. Further, our attention is arrested by the extreme importance and the pregnant significance of the incident here related. Here was one who, neither directly nor indirectly, owed to those who had been previously sent forth by Heaven as teachers of the gospel, either his conversion, or his knowledge of the Christian doctrine, or his mission to preach; but had nevertheless gone forth proclaiming what he affirmed to be Christ's gospel communicated to him by Divine revelation, gathering disciples to be baptized into Christ, and combining such disciples into Churches. In what relation did this doctrine of Paul and the Church organizations which he was setting on foot in the Gentile world stand to the doctrine of the twelve and to the Church organizations framed by them in connection therewith at Jerusalem and in Judaea? These last were assumed to be from heaven; were those more recent phenomena, of doctrines taught and societies formed by Paul, in harmony with the previous ones? Unquestionably and glaringly there were important differences between the external religious life of the twelve and the Jewish believers, and the external religious life which Paul taught the Gentile Churches to adopt. The twelve and the Jewish Christians in general still practised in their daily life the usages of Mosaism, blending the use of such outward forms and ceremonies as appertained to Christian discipleship with those older habits of life preserved intact; in the Gentile Church as moulded by Paul the usages of Mosaism were altogether wanting. Was the seal of Heaven to be recognized as affixed to the Pauline doctrine and the Pauline Church life, as certainly as it was seen to be affixed to the doctrine of the twelve and the Judaeo-Christian Church life? Yes. The verdict of the great leaders of the Jewish Church decided for the full recognition of the Pauline doctrine and the Pauline Church life as in root and essence identical with their own, and as equally with their own derived from heaven. It was a decision come to in the teeth of intense and deeply ingrained prejudices prompting to the adoption of a different conclusion; and must have been due to overpowering evidence leaving them no alternative, seconded we may believe by the secret swaying of their souls by the Holy Ghost. We cannot help reflecting <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> how disastrous the effects would have been of a decision of another kind; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> how remarkably is here illustrated the essential oneness of the Christian life amidst most extreme diversity in its outward manifestation; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> what a strong attestation is afforded to the certain truth of the gospel, revealed to the world through two wholly distinct channels of communication, which yet concurred in delivering what was in reality one and the same message. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/galatians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Only<p>With only this stipulation.<p>We should remember (&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>The only instance in N.T. of this verb in the sense of beneficent care.
