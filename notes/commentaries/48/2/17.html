But if, with all our seeking, something more was needed: viz., a rigid performance of the Law—that Law which we had abandoned—then there was still something wanting to our justification. We were sinners on a par with the Gentiles, and all that Christianity seemed to have done for us was to lead us deeper into sin. A profane thought!<p><span class= "bld">By Christ.</span>—Strictly, <span class= "ital">in Christ</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> by the relation into which we are brought with Him. The reference is here, however, not exactly to the mystical union with Christ, which is regarded by the Apostle rather in connection with sanctification (the actual growth in holiness) than with justification (the judicial absolution from guilt). In the present instance the Apostle is speaking of justification; and when he says that “we are justified in Christ,” he means practically through faith in Him, or through that circle of forces within which we are brought by faith.<p><span class= "bld">We ourselves also.</span>—We who were by our birth Jews, as well as the Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">Are</span> <span class= "bld">found.</span>—Strictly, w<span class= "ital">ere found</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> at a time subsequent to our embracing Christianity, if the only <span class= "ital">result</span> of our Christianity was that we were still sinners.<p><span class= "bld">Sinners.</span>—Sinners actually, through our positive transgressions, and sinners theoretically or judicially (in the eyes of God), through the fact that we have lost the old Jewish justification through the fulfilment of the Law; while, according to this Judaising theory which St. Paul is combating, our new Christian justification is insufficient.<p><span class= "bld">Is therefore Christ the minister of sin?</span>—Our English version is probably right in making this a question. It is put ironically, and as a sort of <span class= "ital">reductio ad absurdum</span> of the Judaising position. The Judaisers maintained the necessity of a strict fulfilment of the Mosaic law. They, however, still called themselves Christians; and here St. Paul had a hold upon them. “You call yourselves Christians,” he says, “and yet you insist upon the Mosaic law. You say that a man cannot be justified without it: it follows that we, who have exchanged the service of the Law for the service of Christ, are not justified. In other words, our relation to Christ has made us, not better, but worse—a thought which no Christian can entertain.”<p>No doubt St. Paul used some such argument as this in his controversy with St. Peter at Antioch, but it would probably be stated in a simpler and less speculative form: “If you still fall back upon the separatist Jewish observances, what is the good of being a Christian?” Here, in writing to the Galatians, the Apostle paraphrases what he had said in language more suited to a theological treatise and to the natural speculative bias of his own mind.<p><span class= "bld">God forbid.</span>—The Judaising theory was quite sufficiently condemned by showing the consequences to which it would lead. It makes Christ Himself a minister of sin—a suggestion which the Apostle puts away with pious horror.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-17.htm" title="But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin?

For what did we believe in Christ? Was it not that we might be justified by the faith of Christ? If so, is it not foolish to go back to the law, and to expect to be justified by the merit of moral works, or sacrifices, or ceremonies? The occasion of this declaration doubtless arose from the ceremonial law; but the argument is quite as strong against all dependence upon the works of the moral law, as respects justification. To give the greater weight to this, it is added, But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is Christ the minister of sin? This would be very dishonourable to Christ, and also very hurtful to them. By considering the law itself, he saw that justification was not to be expected by the works of it, and that there was now no further need of the sacrifices and cleansings of it, since they were done away in Christ, by his offering up himself a sacrifice for us. He did not hope or fear any thing from it; any more than a dead man from enemies. But the effect was not a careless, lawless life. It was necessary, that he might live to God, and be devoted to him through the motives and grace of the gospel. It is no new prejudice, though a most unjust one, that the doctrine of justification by faith alone, tends to encourage people in sin. Not so, for to take occasion from free grace, or the doctrine of it, to live in sin, is to try to make Christ the minister of sin, at any thought of which all Christian hearts would shudder.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ - The connection here is not very clear, and the sense of the verse is somewhat obscure. Rosenmuller supposes that this is an objection of a Jew, supposing that where the Law of Moses is not observed there is no rule of life, and that therefore there must be sin; and that since the doctrine of justification by faith taught that there was no necessity of obeying the ceremonial law of Moses, therefore Christ, who had introduced that system, must be regarded as the author and encourager of sin. To me it seems probable that Paul here has reference to an objection which has in all ages been brought against the doctrine of justification by faith, and which seems to have existed in his time, that the doctrine leads to licentiousness. The objections are that it does not teach the necessity of the observance of the Law in order to acceptance with God. That it pronounces a man justified and accepted who is a violator of the Law. That his acceptance does not depend on moral character.<p>That it releases him from the obligation of law, and that it teaches that a man may be saved though he does not conform to law. These objections existed early, and have been found everywhere where the doctrine of justification by faith has been preached. I regard this verse, therefore, as referring to these objections, and not as being especially the objection of a Jew. The idea is, "You seek to be justified by faith without obeying the Law. You professedly reject that, and do not hold that it is necessary to yield obedience to it. If now it shall turn out that you are sinners; that your lives are not holy; that you are free from the wholesome restraint of the Law, and are given up to lives of sin, will it not follow that Christ is the cause of it; that he taught it; and that the system which he introduced is responsible for it? And is not the gospel therefore responsible for introducing a system that frees from the restraint of the Law, and introduces universal licentiousness?" To this Paul replies by stating distinctly that the gospel has no such tendency, and particularly by referring in the following verses to his own case, and to the effect of the doctrine of justification on his own heart and life.<p>We ourselves are found sinners - If it turns out that we are sinners, or if others discover by undoubted demonstration that we lead lives of sin; if they see us given up to a lawless life, and find us practicing all kinds of evil; if it shall be seen not only that we are not pardoned and made better by the gospel, but are actually made worse, and are freed from all moral restraint.<p>Is therefore Christ the minister of sin? - Is it to be traced to him? Is it a fair and legitimate conclusion that this is the tendency of the gospel? Is it to be charged on him, and on the plan of justification through him, that a lax morality prevails, and that people are freed from the wholesome restraints of law?<p>God forbid - It is not so. This is not the proper effect of the gospel of Christ, and of the doctrine of justification by faith. The system is not suited to produce such a freedom from restraint, and if such a freedom exists, it is to be traced to something else than the gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. Greek, "But if, seeking to be justified IN (that is, in believing union with) Christ (who has in the Gospel theory fulfilled the law for us), we (you and I) ourselves also were found (in your and my former communion with Gentiles) sinners (such as from the Jewish standpoint that now we resume, we should be regarded, since we have cast aside the law, thus having put ourselves in the same category as the Gentiles, who, being without the law, are, in the Jewish view, "sinners," Ga 2:15), is therefore Christ, the minister of sin?" (Are we to admit the conclusion, in this case inevitable, that Christ having failed to justify us by faith, so has become to us the minister of sin, by putting us in the position of "sinners," as the Judaic theory, if correct, would make us, along with all others who are "without the law," Ro 2:14; 1Co 9:21; and with whom, by eating with them, we have identified ourselves?) The Christian mind revolts from so shocking a conclusion, and so, from the theory which would result in it. The whole sin lies, not with Christ, but with him who would necessitate such a blasphemous inference. But his false theory, though "seeking" from Christ, we have not "found" salvation (in contradiction to Christ's own words, Mt 7:7), but "have been ourselves also (like the Gentiles) found" to be "sinners," by having entered into communion with Gentiles (Ga 2:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some interpreters think, that the apostle here begins his discourse to the Galatians upon the main argument of his Epistle, viz. justification by faith in Christ; though others think it began, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-15.htm" title="We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,">Galatians 2:15</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners; </span> if (saith the apostle) you make us grievous offenders in our expectation of being justified by Christ, and not by the works of the law, you make <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Christ the minister of sin, </span> who hath taught us this. But others think that the apostle here obviateth a common objection which was then made, (as it is also in our age), against the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ; viz. That it opens a door of liberty to the flesh, and so makes Christ a <span class="ital">minister of sin, </span> as if he relaxed men’s obligation to the law of God; which is the same objection which the apostle answered in his Epistle to the Romans, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then?

If while, we plead for justification by Christ, we live in a course of notorious disobedience to the law of God, then Christ must be to us a minister of sin, and come into the world to purchase for us a possibility of salvation, though we live in never so much notorious disobedience to the law of God. As if there were no obligation upon men to keep the law, unless by their obedience to it they might obtain pardon of sin and justification.

And in this sort is the objection: if sinners should be justified through Christ by faith without the Law, Christ would approve sinners, and should as it were exhort them to sin by his ministry. Paul answers that this conclusion is false, because Christ destroys sin in the believers: for so, he says, do men flee to Christ through the terror and fear of the Law, that being acquitted from the curse of the Law and justified they may be saved by him. And in addition he together begins in them by little and little that strength and power of his which destroys sin: to the end that this old man being abolished by the power of Christ crucified, Christ may live in them, and they may consecrate themselves to God. Therefore if any man give himself to sin after he has received the Gospel, let him not accuse Christ nor the Gospel, but himself, for he destroys the work of God in himself.<p>(s) He goes from justification to sanctification, which is another benefit we receive from Christ, if we lay hold of him by faith.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/galatians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-17.htm" title="But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin?

The <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> dialectically <span class="ital">carries on</span> the refutation of Peter; but the protasis beginning with <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span> cannot have its apodosis in <span class="greekheb">εὑρέθημεν κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁμ</span>.

Consequently: <span class="ital">But if we</span> (in order to show thee, from what has been just said, how opposed to Christ thy conduct was), <span class="ital">although we sought to he justified in Christ, were found even on our part sinners</span>. This protasis supposes that which must have been the case, if Peter’s Judaizing conduct had been in the right; namely, that the result would then have been that faith does not lead to, or does not suffice for, justification, but that it is requisite to combine with it the observance of the Jewish law. <span class="ital">If</span> faith does <span class="ital">not</span> render the <span class="greekheb">Ἰουδαΐζειν</span> superfluous, as was naturally to be concluded from the course of conduct pursued by Peter, then this seeking after <span class="ital">justification</span> in Christ has shown itself so ineffectual, that the believer just stands on an equality with the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span>, because he has ceased to be a Jew and yet has not attained to righteousness in Christ: he is therefore now nothing else than an <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτωλός</span>, just as the Gentile is. But if this is the case, the apodosis now asks, <span class="ital">Is Christ, therefore, minister of sin</span> (and not of righteousness)?—seeing that our faith in Him, which seeks for righteousness by Him, has the sad result that we have been found like the Gentiles in a state of sin. The <span class="ital">answer</span> to this question is, <span class="ital">Far be it!</span> It is a result to be abhorred, that Christ, instead of bringing about the righteousness sought in Him, should be the promoter of <span class="ital">sin</span>.

Rückert has mistaken the sense of the whole passage: “If we, although we seek grace with God through Christ, nevertheless continue to sin, etc., do ye think that Christ will then take pleasure in us, greater pleasure than in the Gentiles, and thus strengthen and further us in our sin?” Against this it may be urged, that Paul has not written <span class="greekheb">εὑρισκόμεθα</span>; that the comparison with the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span> implied in <span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτοί</span> would be unsuitable, for the sin here reproved would be hypocritical <span class="ital">Judaizing;</span> and that <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-18.htm" title="For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.">Galatians 2:18</a> would not, as is most arbitrarily assumed, give the reason for the <span class="greekheb">μὴ γένοιτο</span>, but, passing over the <span class="greekheb">μὴ γένοιτο</span> and the apodosis, would carry us back to the protasis and prove this latter. The nearest to this erroneous interpretation is that of Beza and Wieseler, who (so also essentially Reithmayr) find expressed here the necessity of the union of sanctification with justification.[101] But the right sense of the passage, as given above, is found in substance, although with several modifications, and in some cases with an incorrect apprehension of the aorist <span class="greekheb">εὑρέθημεν</span> (see above), in Chrysostom, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Castalio, Calvin, Calovius, Estius, Wolf, Wetstein, and others; also Semler, Koppe, Borger, Flatt, Winer, Usteri, Matthies, Schott, Baumgarten-Crusius, de Wette, Hilgenfeld, Ewald, Matthias; several of whom, however, such as the Greek Fathers, Luther, Calovius, Koppe, Usteri, Lachmann, taking the accentuation <span class="greekheb">ἄρα</span>, do not assume any question, which does not alter the essential sense, but does not correspond with the <span class="greekheb">μὴ γένοιτο</span> which follows; while Hilgenfeld unnecessarily supposes a <span class="ital">breviloquence: “then I ask</span>, Is then Christ,” etc.?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span>] “in quo tamen quaerimus justificari,” Bengel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διάκ</span>.] <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτ</span>. emphatically prefixed, in contrast to the <span class="greekheb">δικαιωθῆναι</span>: one, through whom <span class="ital">sin</span> receives service rendered, <span class="ital">sin</span> is upheld and promoted.[102] The opposite, <span class="greekheb">διάκονοι δικαιοσύνης</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-15.htm" title="Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.">2 Corinthians 11:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[98] Hofmann explains it, as if Paul had written <span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ ἐζητοῦμεν</span> (if we, when we became believers, sought, etc.) <span class="greekheb">δικαιωθῆναι ἐν Χριστῷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">εὑρέθημεν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. (we thereby exhibit ourselves at the same time as sinners). According to Hofmann, the <span class="greekheb">εὑρέθημεν</span> is intended to apply to both members of the sentence,—a forced, artificial view for which the context affords neither right nor reason.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[99] So correctly also Lipsius in Hilgenfeld’s <span class="ital">Zeitschr</span>. 1861, p. 73 ff. He, however, improving on Holsten’s similar interpretation, thus explains the whole passage: “If we, being born Jews, have, by our seeking after the salvation in Christ, confessed our sinfulness (and consequently, at the same time, the impotence of the law to make us righteous), does it thence follow that Christ, by inviting also us Jews to seek righteousness in Him and not in the law, has led us astray to a life in Gentile impurity? “But this inference does not stand in logical consistency with the protasis, and could not even suggest itself as a false conclusion; for <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας</span> is assumed to be taken in a different sense from <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτωλοί</span>,—the latter in the sense of <span class="ital">defectus justitiae</span>, the former as <span class="ital">vitiositas ethnica</span>. Holsten also understands <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας</span> as the unfettering of sin in the moral life (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-6.htm" title="Among whom are you also the called of Jesus Christ:">Romans 1:6</a> f., <span class="ital">et al</span>.),—an idea which is here foreign to the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[100] Which is assumed by Wieseler, Buttmann, Hofmann.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[101] They take the essential sense to be: “If the man who is justified in Christ has sinned, Christ is not to blame for this; for (ver. 18) the man himself is to blame for the transgression, because he builds again the dominion of sin which He had destroyed.” So Wieseler. This interpretation is utterly unsuitable, if ver. 15 ff. is still addressed to Peter. It may be urged also against it, that Paul, by using <span class="greekheb">εὑρέθημεν</span> (instead of <span class="greekheb">εὑρισκόμεθα</span>), would have written in a way both obscure and misleading; further, that the relapse of the justified man into sin did not at all suggest or presume as probable the conclusion that Christ was to blame for it; moreover, that the expression <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας διάκονος</span> must assert something of a far stronger and more positive character (namely, sin-<span class="ital">producer</span>); lastly, that ver. 18, taken in Wieseler’s sense, would, notwithstanding its carefully-chosen expressions, contain nothing more than an almost meaningless and self-evident thought, in which, moreover, the destruction of the dominion of sin, which has been accomplished by Christ or by the justifying grace of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>), would be attributed to <span class="ital">man</span> (<span class="greekheb">κατέλυσα</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[102] Luther’s gloss: “Whoever desires to become pious by means of works, acts just as if Christ by His ministry, office, preaching, and sufferings, made us first of all to be sinners who must become pious through the law; thus is Christ denied, crucified again, slandered, and sin is built up again, which had previously been done away by the preaching of faith.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/galatians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-17.htm" title="But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.">Galatians 2:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτωλοί</span>. The last verse arrived at the conclusion that Jewish converts by their own act condemned themselves to be guilty of a broken law. The argument now proceeds on this assumption “<span class="ital">If</span> it be true (as has been shown) that <span class="ital">we by seeking to be justified in Christ were found to be ourselves also sinners</span> as well as the Gentiles—if our sin was then discovered, and it be admitted that confession of sin lies at the root of all Christian life, what then is the attitude of Christ toward sin?”—<span class="greekheb">ἆρα Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διάκονος</span>; This clause is clearly interrogative, and the true reading is <span class="greekheb">ἆρα</span>, not <span class="greekheb">ἄρα</span> (inferential). For here, as always elsewhere In Pauline language, <span class="greekheb">μὴ γένοιτο</span> repudiates a monstrous suggestion, put forward in the form of a question, the mere statement of which is repugnant to the moral sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It was objected to this doctrine of God’s free grace in Christ to guilty sinners that it held out a license to sin by doing away the wholesome restraints of the Law, and so encouraged men to continue in sin by its assurance of pardon. The fallacy is here dismissed with scorn on the strength of the very nature of Christ, but is more fully exposed in the sixth chapter to the Romans.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">while we seek</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">while seeking</span>, i.e. earnestly desiring. The reference is to the time when they embraced the Gospel. Hence, for ‘are found’, read, “were found”, found ourselves in the same position as those ‘sinners’ of the Gentiles, whom we had been accustomed to look down upon, and needing, like them, a <span class="ital">free</span> salvation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we ourselves</span>] not necessarily, ‘I and Peter’ (see note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-14.htm" title="But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compel you the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?">Galatians 2:14</a></span>), but <span class="bld">we</span> who, as Jews, inherited the advantages of the chosen race.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is therefore … of <span class="bld">sin</span>?</span>] Are we to accept the inference that Christ is the minister of sin? The word ‘sin’ has direct reference to ‘sinners’ in the former clause. The Judaizers might taunt the Apostle with the suggestion, that, as faith in Christ had made them ‘sinners’, Christ had become a minister to a state of sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">minister of sin</span>] The antithesis occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-15.htm" title="Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.">2 Corinthians 11:15</a>, “ministers of righteousness”. Is Christ, who is the author and finisher of our faith, employed in a service, which so far from emancipating men from sin, promotes sin?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God forbid</span>] Lit. let it not come to pass! This formula is used by St Paul fourteen times to express a strong denial and utter repudiation of some proposition, either put forward by himself, or suggested by an opponent. “Away with such a thought!” There is of course neither ‘God’ nor ‘forbid’ in the Greek, but the English phrase is an excellent idiomatic equivalent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">17–21</span>. The argument of these verses is somewhat obscure—an obscurity due, partly to the inadequacy of language to express the intensity of the Apostle’s feelings, partly to the introduction of metaphorical expressions, which elude the attempt to define them accurately.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>St Paul, like other Jewish believers, earnestly desiring to escape the penalty of conscious sin, had abandoned all trust in the law, and had thrown himself entirely on the mercy of God in Jesus Christ. If he is now told that in doing this, he and they had foregone their privileges as children of Abraham, and reduced themselves to the position of <span class="ital">sinners</span> of the Gentiles (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-15.htm" title="We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,">Galatians 2:15</a></span>), it might be said that Christ is a minister of sin. Away with such a false conclusion! St Paul had swept away all notion of justification by obedience to the law, because he knew that a man is justified by faith apart from such obedience, and to build up the edifice which he had pulled down would be to stand self-convicted as a transgressor of the law. ‘I’, he says, ‘for one, through the law, through experience of its inability to give life, turned my back on it for ever as a ground of justification before God. I died to the law. Thenceforth, as a ground of justification, it was no more to me than to a dead man. I did this, not that I might be free from the law, as a rule of life, but that I should live the only life worth living—a life impossible to me so long as I sought justification by the law—a life consecrated to God. I have been speaking of dying. There is another sense in which I died. I am crucified with Christ, a partaker of His death, a death issuing in resurrection; and this resurrection life, which I share with and derive from my Divine Lord, itself not natural but spiritual, transforms my whole natural and earthly life, so that I live this latter in the faith of Jesus Christ, who loved me and gave Himself for me. I do not, like the Judaizers, set at nought that grace of God to which I owe so much. And yet to seek justification by works would be practically to nullify it: for if by the law man obtains justification, Christ’s death was purposeless and superfluous’.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/galatians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-17.htm" title="But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin?

But Christ had formed a close relationship with the Gentiles, on account of which he had very properly eaten with them. Wherefore if Peter committed sin in eating with them, the consequence will be that Christ was the <span class="ital">minister</span> of that <span class="ital">sin</span>. Paul so shrinks back from the impropriety of such a consequence, that he not only subjoins, <span class="ital">God forbid</span>, but immediately softens the expression by turning it into an interrogation, and by using also the word <span class="greekheb">διάκονος</span>, <span class="ital">minister</span>, which is well adapted to mark the indignity implied in this passage. There is no blame attached to Christ, conferring righteousness and holiness upon the Gentiles; but the whole blame lies with him, who <span class="ital">renews</span> [builds again] a separation from the Gentiles, after they had been converted to Christ; see following verse.—<span class="greekheb">ζητοῦντες</span>) <span class="ital">while we seek</span>, ever since we have received faith and freedom from the law. This word, <span class="ital">to seek</span>, is represented [virtually expressed] in the preceding verse; and “if while <span class="ital">seeking—we are found</span>,” is a strong antithesis to it.—<span class="greekheb">εὑρέθημεν</span>, <span class="ital">we are found</span>) now, anew.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτοὶ</span>) <span class="ital">we ourselves also</span>, of our own accord.—<span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς</span>, <span class="ital">Christ</span>) <span class="ital">by</span> [<span class="ital">in</span>] <span class="ital">whom</span>, however, we seek to be justified.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/galatians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>); <span class="accented">but if while seeking to be justified in Christ.</span> The present participle, "while seeking," that is," while we sought," is referred back to the time indicated in the words, "we believed," of the preceding verse - the time, that is, when, made aware that works of the Law could not justify, they, Cephas and Paul, severally set themselves to find righteousness in Christ. At that time they in heart utterly renounced the notion that "works of the Law" had any effect upon a man's standing before God; they saw that his doing them could not make him righteous, as well as that his not doing them would not make him a sinner (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-10.htm">Matthew 15:10-20</a>). This was an essential feature of their state of mind in seeking righteousness in Christ. They distinguished Levitical purity and pollution from spiritual and real. And the principle was not only embraced in their hearts, but, in course of time, it embodied itself also, as occasion served, in outward deed. They, both Paul and Cephas himself, were bold to "live after the manner of Gentiles" (ver. 14), and with Gentiles to freely associate. If this was wrong, it was most heinously wrong; for it would be nothing short of a presumptuous setting at nought of God's own Law by which they flagrantly proved themselves to be, in a fatal and damning sense, <span class="accented">sinners.</span> But it was by the gospel that they had been led to think thus and to act thus; in other words, by Christ himself. Would it not, then, follow that Christ was a minister to them, not of righteousness, but of sin, of damning guilt? The participle "seeking" does not merely mark the time at which they were found to be sinners, but also and indeed much more, the course of conduct by which they proved themselves such. The words, "in Christ," are not equivalent to "through Christ," though the former idea includes the latter; the preposition is used in the same sense as in the sentences, "In God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>); "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>); "Sanctified in Christ Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>). It denotes a state of intimate association, union, with Christ, involving justification by necessary consequence. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>, "That I may be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, even that which is of the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ." <span class="cmt_word">We ourselves also are found sinners</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">we ourselves also were found sinners.</span> The word "found" hints a certain measure of surprise (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-21.htm">Romans 7:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>). Cephas was behaving now as if to his painful surprise he had found himself to have been previously acting m a most guilty manner. The word "sinners" appears to denote more than the state of ceremonial uncleanness incurred by violating the prescriptions of Levitical purity; indeed, it meant more even as used by thorough-going ceremonialists (as in ver. 15); it points to the gross outrage which would in the case supposed have been put upon the majesty of God's Law. In the next verse "transgressor" is used as a convertible term. "Ourselves also" - as truly as any Gentile of them all. There is a touch of sarcasm in the clause, having a covert reference to St. Peter having turned his back upon his Gentile brethren as unfit for him to associate with; he thereby was treating <span class="accented">them</span> as "sinners." <span class="cmt_word">Is therefore Christ the minister of sin?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fee;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>;); <span class="accented">is Christ a minister of sin</span>? <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> is found in the New Testament besides only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-8.htm">Luke 18:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-30.htm">Acts 8:30</a>, in both which passages it simply propounds a question, without indicating whether the answer is expected to be negative or affirmative.

"Abhorred be the thought!" we both say; but (the apostle means his interlocutor to understand) since it cannot without horrid impiety be said that Christ was a minister to us of sin and not of righteousness, it follows of necessity that we did <span class="accented">not</span> sin against God when we set the works of the Law aside and sought righteousness in Christ alone without any respect had to them. The Greek phrase is one of several renderings which the Septuagint gives to the Hebrew word <span class="accented">chali'lah</span>, <span class="accented">ad profana</span>, which is frequently used interjectionally to relegate some thought to the category of what is utterly abhorrent and polluted. The Hebrew word is discussed fully in Gesenius's 'Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">in verb.</span> St. Paul uses the Greek phrase twice again in this Epistle (once absolutely, Galatians 3:21, and once inweaved in a sentence, Galatians 6:14); ten times absolutely in his Epistle to the Romans (3, 4, 6, etc.). It occurs also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-16.htm">Luke 20:16</a>.

Paul assumes that this was actually the case: that, seeking to be justified in Christ, they were found to be sinners. To seek to be justified by Christ is an admission that there is no justification by works; that the seeker is unjustified, and therefore a sinner. The effort to attain justification by faith in Christ develops the consciousness of sin. It compels the seeker, whether Jew or Gentile, to put himself upon the common plane of sinners. The Jew who calls the Gentile a sinner, in seeking to be justified by faith, finds himself a sinner also. The law has failed him as a justifying agency. But Paul is careful to repudiate the false inference from this fact, stated in what immediately follows, namely, that Christ is a minister of sin.<p>Minister of sin<p>A promoter of sin by causing us to abandon the law.<p>God forbid (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>. Not a reply merely to the question "is Christ a minister of sin?" but to the whole supposition from "if while we seek." The question is not whether Christ is in general a minister of sin, but whether he is such in the case supposed. Paul does not assume that this false inference has been drawn by Peter or the other Jewish Christians. </body></html>
