That, too, only served to bring out at once the independence and the soundness of my teaching. I spoke on the subject freely to the whole Church, and besides I had private conferences with the leaders; but no alteration was made either in my teaching or in my practice. One crucial instance was that of Titus, my companion, who, Gentile as he was, was not compelled to be circumcised, though his circumcision was urged upon me, not by the free motion of the Apostles themselves, but to silence the malicious rumours set on foot by certain Judaising spies who had found their way into our midst. To these Barnabas and I did not give way for a moment. And the upshot of the matter was that my mission was fully recognised by the leading Apostles, and that we agreed to go different ways—they to the Jews, we to the Gentiles—with the one condition, which I needed no prompting to accept, that we should not forget the poor.<p>Thoughts and arguments crowd in upon the Apostle with great vehemence. His amanuensis cannot take them down fast enough. Sentences are begun and not rightly ended, and much of the sense is left to be supplied by conjecture. The general drift of the passage is sufficiently plain, but there is much uncertainty about the details. This will appear in the Notes which follow.<p>(1) <span class= "bld">Fourteen years after.</span>—From what date is this fourteen years to be reckoned? The phrase “I went up <span class= "ital">again”</span> seems to be decisive in favour of reckoning it from the visit to Jerusalem just mentioned. We should therefore have to add the three years of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a>, in order to reach the date of the Apostle’s conversion The relation of the present narrative to that in the Acts will be more fully discussed in an excursus. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus A: On the Visits of St. Paul to Jerusalem.</span>)<p>In the meantime, it may be assumed that there appear to be sufficient reasons for identifying the visit to Jerusalem here described with that recorded in Acts 15, commonly known as the Council of Jerusalem, which is placed by the best chronologists about A.D. 50 or 51.<p><span class= "bld">And took Titus with me also.</span>—In the corresponding passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-2.htm" title="When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.">Acts 15:2</a>) we are told that “certain others” were sent with Paul and Barnabas. St. Paul mentions especially Titus because of the part which he subsequently played in the history of the Council, and because of the importance of this for his present argument.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/galatians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.">Galatians 2:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then fourteen years after </span>my conversion: <span class="ital">I went up again to Jerusalem </span>— This seems to be the journey mentioned Acts 15., several passages here referring to that great council, wherein all the apostles showed that they were of the same judgment with him. From the history which the apostle gives of himself to the Galatians in the preceding chapter, it appears that from the time of his conversion, to his coming with Barnabas from Tarsus to Antioch, he had no opportunity of conversing with the apostles in a body, consequently in that period he was not made an apostle by them. And by relating in a similar way, in this chapter, what happened when he went up from Antioch to Jerusalem, fourteen years after his conversion, in company with Barnabas, he proves to them that he was an apostle before he had that meeting with the apostles in a body; for at that time, instead of receiving the gospel from the apostles, he communicated to them the gospel, or doctrine, which he preached among the idolatrous Gentiles: not because he acknowledged them his superiors, or was in any doubt about the truth of his doctrine, but lest it might have been suspected that his doctrine was disclaimed by the apostles, which would have marred his success among the Gentiles. <span class="ital">And took Titus with me also — </span>Though he was uncircumcised, that I might therein show my Christian liberty, and assert that of my Gentile brethren, against those who are so zealous in their attempts to invade it. “This is the earliest mention that we meet with of Titus, for he is no where mentioned by St. Luke in the Acts; and what we read of him in the second epistle to the Corinthians, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm" title="I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.">2 Corinthians 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>,) as well as in that to Timothy, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm" title="For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.">2 Timothy 4:10</a>,) was later by some years. He is here said to have been a Greek, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-3.htm" title="But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:">Galatians 2:3</a>,) and being born of Gentile parents, was not circumcised; but where or when he was converted is uncertain; only we may conclude he was converted by Paul, from the title he gives him of <span class="ital">his own son after the common faith, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm" title="To Titus, my own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.">Titus 1:4</a>; and as he now took Titus with him from Antioch to Jerusalem, so he employed him afterward on several occasions, and appears to have regarded him with great affection and endearment.” — Doddridge.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/galatians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-10 Observe the apostle's faithfulness in giving a full account of the doctrine he had preached among the Gentiles, and was still resolved to preach, that of Christianity, free from all mixture of Judaism. This doctrine would be ungrateful to many, yet he was not afraid to own it. His care was, lest the success of his past labours should be lessened, or his future usefulness be hindered. While we simply depend upon God for success to our labours, we should use every proper caution to remove mistakes, and against opposers. There are things which may lawfully be complied with, yet, when they cannot be done without betraying the truth, they ought to be refused. We must not give place to any conduct, whereby the truth of the gospel would be reflected upon. Though Paul conversed with the other apostles, yet he did not receive any addition to his knowledge, or authority, from them. Perceiving the grace given to him, they gave unto him and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, whereby they acknowledged that he was designed to the honour and office of an apostle as well as themselves. They agreed that these two should go to the heathen, while they continued to preach to the Jews; judging it agreeable to the mind of Christ, so to divide their work. Here we learn that the gospel is not ours, but God's; and that men are but the keepers of it; for this we are to praise God. The apostle showed his charitable disposition, and how ready he was to own the Jewish converts as brethren, though many would scarcely allow the like favour to the converted Gentiles; but mere difference of opinion was no reason to him why he should not help them. Herein is a pattern of Christian charity, which we should extend to all the disciples of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/galatians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then fourteen years after - That is, 14 years after his first visit there subsequent to his conversion. Some commentators, however, suppose that the date of the fourteen years is to be reckoned from his conversion. But the more obvious construction is, to refer it to the time of his visit there, as recorded in the previous chapter; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-18.htm">Galatians 2:18</a>. This time was spent in Asia Minor chiefly in preaching the gospel.<p>I went up again to Jerusalem - It is commonly supposed that Paul here refers to the visit which he made as recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>. The circumstances mentioned are substantially the same; and the object which he had at that time in going up was one whose mention was entirely pertinent to the argument here. He went up with Barnabas to submit a question to the assembled apostles and elders at Jerusalem, in regard to the necessity of the observance of the laws of Moses. Some persons who had come among the Gentile converts from Judea had insisted on the necessity of being circumcised in order to be saved. Paul and Barnabas had opposed them; and the dispute had become so warm that it was agreed to submit the subject to the apostles and elders at Jerusalem. For that purpose Paul and Barnabas had been sent, with certain others, to lay the case before all the apostles. As the question which Paul was discussing in this Epistle was about the necessity of the observance of the laws of Moses in order to justification, it was exactly in point to refer to a journey when this very question had been submitted to the apostles. Paul indeed had made another journey to Jerusalem before this with the collection for the poor saints in Judea <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29-30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>, but he does not mention that here, probably because he did not then see the other apostles, or more probably because that journey furnished no illustration of the point now under debate. On the occasion here referred to <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, the very point under discussion here constituted the main subject of inquiry, and it was definitely settled.<p>And took Titus with me also - Luke, in the Acts of the Apostles Act 15:2, says, that there were others with Paul and Barnabas on that journey to Jerusalem, but who they were he does not mention. It is by no means certain that Titus was appointed by the church to go to Jerusalem; but the contrary is more probable. Paul seems to have taken him with him as a private affair; but the reason is not mentioned. It may have been to show his Christian liberty, and his sense of what he had a right to do; or it may have been to furnish a case on the subject of inquiry, and submit the matter to them whether Titus was to be circumcised. He was a Greek; but he had been converted to Christianity. Paul had not circumcised him; but had admitted him to the full privileges of the Christian church. Here then was a case in point; and it may have been important to have had such a case before them, so that they might fully understand it. This, as Doddridge properly remarks, is the first mention which occurs of Titus. He is not mentioned by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles, and though his name occurs several times in the Second Epistle to the <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-13.htm">1 Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-6.htm">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>, yet it is to be remembered that that Epistle was written a considerable time after this to the Galatians. Titus was a Greek, and was doubtless converted by the labors of Paul, because he calls him his own "son," <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>. He attended Paul frequently in his travels; was employed by him in important services (see 2 Corinthians  the places referred to above); was left by him in Crete to set in order the things that were missing, and to ordain elders there <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>; subsequently, he went into Dalmatia <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>, and is supposed to have returned again to Crete, where it is said he propagated the gospel in the neighboring islands, and died at the age of 94 - Calmet. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/galatians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>Ga 2:1-21. His Co-ordinate Authority as Apostle of the Circumcision Recognized by the Apostles.

Translate, "After fourteen years"; namely, from Paul's conversion inclusive [Alford]. In the fourteenth year from his conversion [Birks]. The same visit to Jerusalem as in Ac 15:1-4 (A.D. 50), when the council of the apostles and Church decided that Gentile Christians need not be circumcised. His omitting allusion to that decree is; (1) Because his design here is to show the Galatians his own independent apostolic authority, whence he was not likely to support himself by their decision. Thus we see that general councils are not above apostles. (2) Because he argues the point upon principle, not authoritative decisions. (3) The decree did not go the length of the position maintained here: the council did not impose Mosaic ordinances; the apostle maintains that the Mosaic institution itself is at an end. (4) The Galatians were Judaizing, not because the Jewish law was imposed by authority of the Church as necessary to Christianity, but because they thought it necessary to be observed by those who aspired to higher perfection (Ga 3:3; 4:21). The decree would not at all disprove their view, and therefore would have been useless to quote. Paul meets them by a far more direct confutation, "Christ is of no effect unto you whosoever are justified by the law" (Ga 5:4), [Paley].<p>Titus &#8230; also&#8212;specified on account of what follows as to him, in Ga 2:3.

Even the passages which are appealed to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-19.htm" title="But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,">Acts 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-9.htm" title="And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.">Acts 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-10.htm" title="And the brothers immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night to Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.">Acts 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-31.htm" title="Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.">Acts 23:31</a>, admit the rendering of <span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς νυκτός</span> as <span class="ital">throughout the night</span>, without deviation from the common linguistic usage.[41] Moreover, how unintelligibly Paul would have expressed himself, if, without giving the slightest intimation of it (possibly by <span class="greekheb">ἐξ οὗ ἐν Χριστῷ εἰμι</span>, or in some other way), he had meant the present duration of his standing as a Christian! Lastly, how entirely idle and objectless in itself would be such a specification of time! For that Paul could only speak of <span class="ital">the</span> journeys which he made <span class="ital">as a Christian</span> to Jerusalem, was self-evident; but whether at the time when he wrote the epistle his life as a Christian had lasted 14 years, or longer or shorter, was a point of no importance for the main object of the passage, and the whole statement as to the time would be without any motive in harmony with the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">From what point has Paul reckoned the</span> 14 <span class="ital">years?</span> The answer, <span class="ital">From the ascension of Christ</span> (Chronic. Euseb., Peter Lombard, Lud. Cappellus, Paulus), must at once be excluded as quite opposed to the context. Usually, however, the <span class="ital">conversion</span> of the apostle is taken as the <span class="ital">terminus a quo</span> (so Olshausen, Anger, Matthies, Schott, Fritzsche, Baumgarten-Crusius, Wieseler, Hilgenfeld, Ebrard, Ewald, <span class="ital">apost. Zeit</span>. p. 55, Stölting), an appeal being made to the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a>. Thus the three years of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a> would be again included in the fourteen years. But <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> and the <span class="greekheb">διά</span>, indicating the <span class="ital">interval</span> which in the meantime had elapsed, point rather to the <span class="ital">first journey to Jerusalem</span> as the <span class="ital">terminus a quo</span>. The <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> points back to <span class="ital">the first</span> journey, and so <span class="greekheb">διὰ δεκατεσσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐτῶν</span> presents itself most naturally as the period intervening between the first journey and this <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>. If Paul had again written <span class="greekheb">μετά</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a>, we might have inferred from the intentional identity of expression the identity also of the starting-point; but since he has here chosen the word <span class="greekheb">διά</span> not elsewhere employed by him in this sense (after an <span class="ital">interval</span> of fourteen years), the relation of this <span class="greekheb">διά</span> to <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> leads us to take the first journey to Jerusalem as the starting-point of the reckoning. This is the reckoning adopted by Jerome, Chrysostom on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11</a>, Luther,[42] Ussher, Clericus, Lightfoot, Bengel, Stroth (in the <span class="ital">Repert. für bibl. u. morgenl.

If Paul had meant a <span class="ital">third</span> journey, and had kept silence as to the <span class="ital">second</span>, he would have furnished his opponents, to whom he desired to prove that he was not a disciple of the apostles, with weapons against himself; and the suspicion of intentionally incomplete enumeration would have rested on him justly, so far as his adversaries were concerned. Indeed, even if on occasion of a second visit to Jerusalem, here passed over, he had not come at all into close contact with the apostles (and how highly improbable this would be in itself!), he would have been the less likely to have omitted it, as, in this very character of a journey which had had nothing to do with any sort of instruction by the apostles (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a>), it would have been of the greatest importance for his object, in opposition to the suspicions of his opponents.[44] To have kept silence as to this journey would have cut the sinews of his whole <span class="ital">historically</span> apologetic demonstration, which he had entered upon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm" title="For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:">Galatians 1:13</a> and still continues from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-21.htm" title="Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;">Galatians 1:21</a> (though Hofmann thinks otherwise). Comp. also Bleek, <span class="ital">Beitr</span>. p. 55. This purely exegetical ground is quite decisive in favour of the view that Paul here speaks of his <span class="ital">second</span> journey to Jerusalem;[45] and considered by itself, therefore, our passage presents no difficulty at all. The difficulty only arises when we compare it with Acts. According to the latter, the <span class="ital">second</span> journey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>) is that which Paul made with Barnabas in the year 44 in order to convey pecuniary assistance to Judaea; hence many hold our journey as identical with that related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>.

So also Caspari (<span class="ital">geograph. chronol. Einl. in d. Leb. Jesu</span>, 1869). But the chronology, through the 14 years, is decisively opposed to this view. For as the year 44 A.D. or 797 U.C. is the established date of the journey in question (see <span class="ital">Introd. to Acts</span>), these 14 years with the addition of the three years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a>) would carry us back to the year 27 A.D.! Among the defenders of this view, Böttger has indeed turned <span class="greekheb">δεκατεσσάρων</span> into <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΕΣΣΆΡΩΝ</span></span></span>; but how little he is justified in this, see below. Fritzsche, on the other hand, has endeavoured to bring out the 14 years, by supposing the reckoning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a> to begin from the year of the <span class="ital">joint</span> regency of Tiberius, that is, the year 765 U.C., as, following Ussher, has been done by Clericus, Lardner, and others (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a>), and now also by Wieseler in Herzog’s <span class="ital">Encykl</span>. XXI. p. 547 ff., and especially in his <span class="ital">Beitr. z. Würdigung d. Evang</span>. 1869, p. 177 ff. It is assumed, consequently, that Christ commenced His ministry in 779, and was crucified in 781; that Paul became a Christian at the beginning of 783, and that 14 years later, in 797, the journey in question to Jerusalem took place. But against the assumption that the 14 years are to be reckoned from Paul’s conversion, see above. Besides, the year of the conversion cannot, for other chronological reasons, be put back beyond the year 35 A.D., that is, 788 U.C. (see on Acts, <span class="ital">Introd</span>.). Lastly, the hypothesis, that Luke in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm" title="O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?">Galatians 3:1</a> did not reckon from the actual commencement of the reign of Tiberius, is nothing but a forced expedient based on extraneous chronological combinations, and finding no support at all in the plain words of Luke himself (see further, in opposition to it, Anger, <span class="ital">rat. temp</span>. p. 14 f., and <span class="ital">z. Chronol. d. Lehramtes Chr</span>. I.). The opinion, therefore, that the journey <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.">Galatians 2:1</a> is identical with that mentioned in Acts 11, must be rejected; and we must, on the other hand, assume that <span class="ital">in point of fact</span> those expositors have arrived at the correct conclusion who consider it as the same which, according to Acts 15, was undertaken by Paul and Barnabas to the apostolic conference. So Irenaeus, <span class="ital">adv. haer</span>. iii. 13, Theodoret, Jerome, Baronius, Cornelius a Lapide, Pearson, and most of the older expositors, Semler, Koppe, Stroth, Vogel (in Gabler’s <span class="ital">Journ. für auserl. theol. Lit</span>. I. 2, p. 249 ff.), Haselaar, Borger, Schmidt (<span class="ital">Einl</span>. I. p. 192 and in the <span class="ital">Analect</span>. III. 1), Eichhorn, Hug, Winer, Hemsen, Feilmoser, Hermann (<span class="ital">de P. ep. ad Gal. tribus prim. capp</span>., Lips. 1832), Usteri, Matthies, Schott, Olshausen, Anger, Schneckenburger, Neander, Baumgarten-Crusius, Baur, Hilgenfeld, Zeller, Lekebusch, Elwert, Lechler (<span class="ital">apost. u. nachapost. Zeitalt</span>. p. 394 ff.), Thiersch, Reuss, Reiche, Ewald, Ritschl, Bleek, Ellicott, Hofmann, Laurent, Holsten, Trip, Oertel, and others.[47] This result is, however, to be based in the first instance not on a comparison of the historical references contained in Galatians 2 and Acts 15, but on <span class="greekheb">διὰ δεκατεσσάρων ἐτῶν</span>; and the historical references of Acts 15 afterwards serve merely as a partial, although very material, confirmation. For the point of view, from which the journey is brought forward in our passage, is one so special and subjective, that it cannot present itself in the connected objectively historical narrative of Acts, whether we take it in connection with Acts 11 or Acts 15. By the search for points of agreement and of difference, with the view of thereby arriving at a decision, far too much room is left for argument <span class="ital">pro</span> and <span class="ital">contra</span>, and consequently for the play of subjective influences, to reach any certain result.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[41] See on these passages the <span class="ital">Commentary on Acts</span>.

For if he had shown that <span class="ital">up to the apostolic council</span> (see the sequel) he could not have received the instruction of the apostles, his task of proof was <span class="ital">completely solved;</span> because on occasion of his presence at that council he received formal acknowledgment and sanction as the apostle to the Gentiles. If up to that time he had not been a disciple of the apostles, now, when he had received in an official way the fullest acknowledgment as an independent apostle, there could no longer be any discussion as to his having at some subsequent date procured apostolic instruction in Jerusalem. It would therefore have been purely unmeaning, and even absurd, to have continued the history of his journeys to Jerusalem beyond the date of the apostolic council. But <span class="ital">up to that date</span> he could not <span class="ital">omit any</span> journey, without rendering his historical deduction <span class="ital">nugatory as a proof</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[45] Bloch, <span class="ital">Chronotax</span>. p. 67 f., and Schott find <span class="ital">two</span> journeys mentioned in ver. 1 : the former obtains them from <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> (after 14 years I made the second journey to Jerusalem, undertaken with Barnabas); and the latter brings them out thus: “intra 14 annos iterata vice adscendi Hierosolymas, cum Barnaba quidem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>), posthac (Acts 15) assumto etiam Tito.” Both views are <span class="ital">introduced</span> into the passage inconsistently with the text. For according to Bloch’s explanation, Paul must have spoken previously of a journey made with Barnabas; and in Schott’s interpretation not only is <span class="greekheb">διά</span> wrongly understood (see above), but it would be necessary at least that instead of <span class="greekheb">συμπαραλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ Τίτον</span> the text should run, <span class="greekheb">εἶτα δὲ συμπαραλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.

But in the <span class="ital">second</span> edition of Major’s <span class="ital">Annotata</span>, which appeared after his death, Jena 1670, 4to, Major (p. 410 ff.) pronounces decidedly for the view which holds the journey mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.">Galatians 2:1</a> to be identical with that in Acts 15.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[47] Rückert does not come to a decision, but (in his Commentary and in the (<span class="ital">exeget.

NARRATIVE OF THE AUTHOR’S VISIT WITH BARNABAS TO THE CHURCH OF JERUSALEM, HIS FRUITLESS NEGOTIATIONS WITH PARTY LEADERS, AND THE BROTHERLY WELCOME AND RECOGNITION HE RECEIVED FROM JAMES PETER AND JOHN.—The author has shown by a rapid glance over the first thirteen years of his Christian life how independent he had been of human teaching at his conversion and subsequently. He now proceeds to record the true history of the negotiations which he had undertaken at Jerusalem in conjunction with Barnabas in the fourteenth year of his ministry. (On the identity of this conference with the Apostolic Council, whose proceedings are recorded in Acts 15, see Introd., pp. 141–144). The Galatians were well aware of the position of Paul and Barnabas in the Church of Antioch: it was not therefore necessary to state in express terms that they were deputed to represent that Church. Enough that their first act was to lay before the Church of Jerusalem an account of the Gospel they were preaching to the Gentiles, and that their divine commission to the Gentiles was fully recognised by the leaders of the Church at Jerusalem. They knew already the general outline of events: for the resolution adopted at Jerusalem, and subsequently approved at Antioch, had been duly communicated to them by Paul himself. His object in this Epistle is to remove misconstruction as to his own position. His reference of this question to the Church of Jerusalem had been misrepresented as an act of submission and acknowledgment of his own inferiority, whereas he had really procured the condemnation of <span class="ital">the false brethren</span> who denied his authority, had silenced his opponents, and met with brotherly fellowship and full recognition at the hands of James Peter and John.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/galatians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">fourteen years after</span>] This is not to be reckoned from the time of the first visit, mentioned ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-18.htm" title="Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.">Galatians 1:18</a>, but from the date of St Paul’s conversion; and this visit may therefore be assigned to a.d. 51. It was on the occasion described in Acts 15.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>St Paul had gone to Jerusalem once during the interval, to carry relief to the poor brethren who were suffering from the famine, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>. But he does not here refer to <span class="ital">that</span> visit, because its object and attendant circumstances are foreign to the purpose of his present argument, and because he had probably no opportunity then of conferring with the Apostles. The visit was purely one of benevolence, and may have been brief in duration. Calvin, however, and others identify the visit of this verse with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>. Twice after this, St Paul revisited the Holy City—in a.d. 54, of which visit a cursory mention is made <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/18-21.htm" title="But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem: but I will return again to you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus....">Acts 18:21-22</a>, and finally in a.d. 58 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-17.htm" title="And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.">Acts 21:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with Barnabas</span>] This name, which signifies ‘the Son of Exhortation’, was given by the Apostles to an early convert, whose original name was Joseph or Joses. He was a Levite of Cyprus, and was associated with Paul in the commencement of his missionary work among the Gentiles. He accompanied him on this occasion, as well as on the previous visit to Jerusalem, recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>. Like St Paul, though not of the number of the Twelve, he was included in “the glorious company of the Apostles”[26] (see Lightfoot, p. 93).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[26] His festival is retained in the Calendar of the English Church, with special Collect, Epistle and Gospel.
