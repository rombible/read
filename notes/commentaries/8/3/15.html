It must be allowed that a fair number of Hebrew MSS., as well as the Peshito and Vulgate, take the verb in the feminine. The LXX. is from the nature of the Greek language unable to mark the distinction. The clause. if we accept the current reading, will mean that Boaz went to the city to find the kinsman whose claim lay before his own, while Ruth, laden with six measures of barley, goes to her mother-in-law.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:14-18 Ruth had done all that was fit for her to do, she must patiently wait the event. Boaz, having undertaken this matter, would be sure to manage it well. Much more reason have true believers to cast their care on God, because he has promised to care for them. Our strength is to sit still, Isa 30:7. This narrative may encourage us to lay ourselves by faith at the feet of Christ: He is our near Kinsman; having taken our nature upon him. He has the right to redeem. Let us seek to receive from him his directions: Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Ac 9:6. He will never blame us as doing this unseasonably. And let us earnestly desire and seek the same rest for our children and friends, that it may be well with them also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The vail - Quite a different word from that rendered "vail," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14</a>.

Which seems to confirm the first sense, that what he had said before was to Ruth, beside which he also said to her what follows: <p>bring the vail which thou hast upon thee, and hold it; by which it appears that he rose also thus early, since he ordered her to bring her vail to him, and hold it with both her hands, while he filled it from the heap of corn: this vail was either what she wore on her head, as women used to do, or a coverlet she brought with her to cover herself with, when she lay down; the Septuagint renders it a "girdle", that is, an apron she tied or girt about her; which is as likely as anything: and when she held it, he measured six measures of barley; what these measures were is not expressed; the Targum is six seahs or bushels, as the Vulgate Latin version, but that is too much, and more than a woman could carry; unless we suppose, with the Targum, that she had strength from the Lord to carry it, and was extraordinarily assisted by him in it, which is not very probable; rather six omers, an omer being the tenth part of an ephah, and so was a quantity she might be able to carry: <p>and laid it upon her; upon her shoulder, or put it on her head, it being, no doubt, as much as she could well bear, and which required some assistance to help her up with it: <p>and she went into the city; of Bethlehem, with her burden; or rather he went (b); for the word is masculine, and to be understood of Boaz, who accompanied her to the city, lest she should meet with any that should abuse her; and so the Targum expresses it,"Boaz went into the city.'' <p>(b) "et ingressus est", Tigurine version.

The gift is intended for Naomi, who would have to consent to the marriage, as standing in the relation of parent to Ruth. Mr S. A. Cook points out a parallel in a Babylonian tablet (<span class="ital">KB.</span> iv.

The verb employed - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> - was common Semitic property, ere yet the mother-tongue was subdivided into Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldee, Arabic. <span class="cmt_word">The wrapper which is upon thee.</span> The word for <span class="accented">wrapper</span> occurs nowhere else except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-22.htm">Isaiah 3:22</a>, where it is translated, in King James's version, "wimple." Here it is rendered "vail," and, in the margin, "sheet or apron," - all of them unhappy translations. So is the rendering of the Targumist, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. <span class="accented">sudarium</span>, or "napkin." N.G. Schroder discusses the word at great length in his masterly 'Commentarius Philologico-Criticus de Vestitu Mulierum Hebraearum,' pp. 247-277. He would render it <span class="accented">pallium</span> or <span class="accented">palla</span> In consequence of national peculiarities in articles of dress, especially in ancient times, it is best to avoid a specific, and to employ a generic translation. When Boaz said, "Give me the <span class="accented">wrapper</span>," he did not ask that it should be handed to him. He had already put his hand upon it, and was engaged in hollowing out a scoop or cavity. Hence he said, on the one hand, "Allow me," and, on the other, "Hold on by it." <span class="cmt_word">And he measured six measures of barley.</span> The particular measure referred to is unspecified. It is not only mere dream on the part of the Targumist, but it is dream involving almost sheer impossibility, that the measures were <span class="accented">seahs</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two ephahs. The Targumist had to bolster up his dream by adding another, viz., that Ruth got miraculously strength to carry the load. Load, indeed, there undoubtedly was; and no doubt it would be as great as she could conveniently carry. And likewise, in accordance with the primitive simplicity of manners, the magnitude of the burden would be demonstration to Naomi of Boaz's satisfaction with the "<span class="accented">measures"</span> which, in full motherliness of spirit, she had planned. <span class="cmt_word">And he went to the city.</span> The Vulgate and Syriac versions, as also Castellio, Coverdale, and various other translators, but not Luther, have assumed that we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;</span>, "and she went," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;</span>, "and he went." So too Wright. But there seems to be no good reason for making the change. If there had been no division into verses, then the departure of both Boaz and Ruth on their respective routes, or in their respective order of sequence, would have been recorded close together: "and 'he' went to the city, and 'she' went to her mother-in-law" - each, let us bear in mind, with the heart elate. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In answer to his inquiry, "Who art thou?" she said, "I am Ruth, thine handmaid; spread thy wing over thine handmaid, for thou art a redeemer." &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1498; is a dual according to the Masoretic pointing, as we cannot look upon it as a pausal form on account of the position of the word, but it is most probably to be regarded as a singular; and the figurative expression is not taken from birds, which spread their wings over their young, i.e., to protect them, but refers, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>, to the wing, i.e., the corner of the counterpane, referring to the fact that a man spreads this over his wife as well as himself. Thus Ruth entreated Boaz to marry her because he was a redeemer. On this reason for the request, see the remarks in the introduction to the chapter. </body></html>
