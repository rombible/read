Being a judge of Israel, Boaz would tell Ruth what she should do; also whether he had the right of redemption, and what methods must be taken, and what rites used, in order to accomplishing her marriage with him or another person. The conduct of Boaz calls for the highest praise. He attempted not to take advantage of Ruth; he did not disdain her as a poor, destitute stranger, nor suspect her of any ill intentions. He spoke honourably of her as a virtuous woman, made her a promise, and as soon as the morning arrived, sent her away with a present to her mother-in-law. Boaz made his promise conditional, for there was a kinsman nearer than he, to whom the right of redemption belonged.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Turned himself - Rather, "bent forward," so as to feel what it was which was at his feet.

In ordinary circumstances these would have seemed indecorous to the world; but in the case of Ruth, it was a method, doubtless conformable to prevailing usage, of reminding Boaz of the duty which devolved on him as the kinsman of her deceased husband. Boaz probably slept upon a mat or skin; Ruth lay crosswise at his feet&#8212;a position in which Eastern servants frequently sleep in the same chamber or tent with their master; and if they want a covering, custom allows them that benefit from part of the covering on their master's bed. Resting, as the Orientals do at night, in the same clothes they wear during the day, there was no indelicacy in a stranger, or even a woman, putting the extremity of this cover over her.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ruth/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">At midnight; </span> he did not discover her sooner, though she did not uncover his feet, being it seems in a deep sleep, as is usual after feasts, and she doing no more that her mother commanded her, and using no words or gestures which might provoke his lust; wherein she showed her temperance and modesty, and that what she did was only by her mother’s instigation and advice, which plainly appeared from her desire expressed, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-9.htm" title="And he said, Who are you?

What could it be? In a moment or two he recovered his self-possession, and bending himself up and over, or "crooking himself, to see and to feel, lo, a woman was lying at his feet. The Chaldee Targumist tumbles into a ludicrous bathos of taste when endeavoring to emphasize the startle and shiver which Boas experienced. He says, "He trembled, <span class="accented">and his flesh</span>, <span class="accented">became soft as a turnip</span> from the agitation. How could the most peddling and paltering of Rabbis succeed in betraying himself into such a laughable puerility and absurdity? The explanation, though of course it is not the least atom of justification, lies in the fact that the Chaldee word for "turnip" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> while the verb that de notes "he bent himself" is the niphal of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>. The use of the expression "<span class="accented">the</span> man," in this and several of the adjoining verses, is apt to grate a little upon English ears. Let us explain and vindicate the term as we may, the grating is still felt. No matter though we know that "<span class="accented">the</span> rank is but the guinea stamp," the grating is felt inevitably. It is a result of that peculiar growth in living language that splits generic terms into such as are specific or semi-specific. We have <span class="accented">gentleman</span> as well as <span class="accented">man</span>, and embarrassment is not infrequently the result of our linguistic wealth. In the verse before us, and in some of those that go before, we should be disposed, in our English idiom, to employ the proper name: "<span class="accented">And</span> it came to pass at midnight that ' Boaz' started in a fright." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Naomi conjectured, from the favour which Boaz had shown to Ruth, that he might not be disinclined to marry her as gol, she said to her daughter-in-law, "My daughter, I must seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee." In the question &#1488;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1500;&#1488;, the word &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; is here, as usual, an expression of general admission or of undoubted certainty, in the sense of "Is it not true, I seek for thee? it is my duty to seek for thee." &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1495;  equals  &#1502;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-9.htm">Ruth 1:9</a>) signifies the condition of a peaceful life, a peaceful and well-secured condition, "a secure life under the guardian care of a husband" (Rosenmller). "And now is not Boaz our relation, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he is winnowing the barley floor (barley on the threshing-floor) to-night," i.e., till late in the night, to avail himself of the cool wind, which rises towards evening (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>), for the purpose of cleansing the corn. The threshing-floors of the Israelites were, and are still in Palestine, made under the open heaven, and were nothing more than level places in the field stamped quite hard.<p>(Note: "A level spot is selected for the threshing-floors, which are then constructed near each other, of a circular form, perhaps fifty feet in diameter, merely by beating down the earth hard." - Robinson, Pal. ii. p. 277.)</body></html>
