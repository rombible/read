In the year of Jubilee, the property would return to the family, on which it was, so to speak, settled, but Boaz proposes to the <span class= "ital">Goel </span>that he should redeem the property at once.

This kinsman, when he heard the conditions of the bargain, refused it. In like manner many are shy of the great redemption; they are not willing to espouse religion; they have heard well of it, and have nothing to say against it; they will give it their good word, but they are willing to part with it, and cannot be bound to it, for fear of marring their own inheritance in this world. The right was resigned to Boaz. Fair and open dealing in all matters of contract and trade, is what all must make conscience of, who would approve themselves true Israelites, without guile.

Naomi, we must suppose, had previously taken Ruth into full confidence, so that Boaz could learn at second- hand what in other circumstances he would have learned from Naomi herself. The verb which we have rendered "has resolved to sell," is literally "has sold," and has been so rendered by many expositors, inclusive of Riegler and Wright. The Syriac translator gives the expression thus, "has sold to me." The subsequent context, however, makes it evident that the property had not been sold to any one, and consequently not to Boaz. The perfect verb is to be accounted for on the principle explained by Driver when he says, "The perfect is employed to indicate actions, the accomplishment of which lies indeed in the future, but is regarded as dependent upon such an unalterable determination of the will that it may be spoken of as having actually taken place: thus a resolution, promise, or decree, especially a Divine one, is very frequently announced in the perfect tense. A striking instance is afforded by Ruth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-3.htm">Ruth 4:3</a>) when Boaz, speaking of Naomi's determination to sell her land, says <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5da;&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, literally, 'has sold' (has resolved to sell. The English idiom would be 'is selling')" ('Treatise on the Use of the Tenses in Hebrew,' pp. 13, 14). In King James's English version the verb is thus freely rendered "<span class="accented">selleth</span>." Luther's version is <span class="accented">equivalent - beut feil</span>, "<span class="accented">offers</span> for sale;" or, as Coverdale renders it, "<span class="accented">offereth</span> to sell." Vatable freely renders it as we   have done, "has determined to sell" (<span class="accented">vendere decrepit</span>) so Drusius (<span class="accented">vendere instituit</span>). The kind family feeling of Boaz, shining out m the expression, "our <span class="accented">brother</span> Ehmelech," is noteworthy. "Brother" was to him a homely and gracious term for "near kinsman." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He then said, "Bring the cloak that thou hast on, and lay hold of it" (to hold it open), and measured for her six measures of barley into it as a present, that she might not to back empty to her mother-in-law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-17.htm">Ruth 3:17</a>). &#1502;&#1496;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-22.htm">Isaiah 3:22</a>, is a broad upper garment, pallium, possibly only a large shawl. "As the cloaks worn by the ancients were so full, that one part was thrown upon the shoulder, and another gathered up under the arm, Ruth, by holding a certain part, could receive into her bosom the corn which Boaz gave her" (Schrder, De vestit. mul. p. 264). Six (measures of) barley: the measure is not given. According to the Targum and the Rabbins, it was six seahs  equals  two ephahs. This is certainly incorrect; for Ruth would not have been able to carry that quantity of barley home. When Boaz had given her the barley he measured out, and had sent here away, he also went into the city. This is the correct rendering, as given by the Chaldee, to the words &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;; though Jerome referred the words to Ruth, but certainly without any reason, as &#1497;&#1489;&#1488; cannot stand for &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488;. This reading is no doubt found in some of the MSS, but it merely owes its origin to a mistaken interpretation of the words. </body></html>
