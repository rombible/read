This kinsman, when he heard the conditions of the bargain, refused it. In like manner many are shy of the great redemption; they are not willing to espouse religion; they have heard well of it, and have nothing to say against it; they will give it their good word, but they are willing to part with it, and cannot be bound to it, for fear of marring their own inheritance in this world. The right was resigned to Boaz. Fair and open dealing in all matters of contract and trade, is what all must make conscience of, who would approve themselves true Israelites, without guile.

It is a primitive phrase to denote internal resolution. There is a point where thought and speech coalesce. Our words are thoughts, and our thoughts are words. <span class="cmt_word">I will uncover thine ear,</span> that is, "I will lift the locks of hair that may be covering the ear, so as to communicate something in confidence." But here the phrase is employed with the specific import of secrecy dropt out. It is thus somewhat equivalent to "I will give thee notice;" only the following expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="cmt_word">to say,</span> must be read in the light of the undiluted original phrase, "<span class="accented">I</span> will uncover thine ear to say. The whole expression furnishes the most beautiful instance imaginable of the primary meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span>. The thing that was to be said follows immediately, viz., <span class="cmt_word">Acquire it</span>, or <span class="cmt_word">Buy it.</span> It is as if he had said, "<span class="accented">Now</span> you have a chance which may not occur again." It is added, <span class="cmt_word">in the presence of the inhabitants.</span> This, rather than "the assessors," is the natural interpretation of the participle (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). It is the translation which the word generally receives in the very numerous instances in which it occurs. There was, so to speak, a fair representation of the inhabitants of the city in the casual company that had assembled in the gateway. And <span class="cmt_word">in presence of the elders of my people.</span> The natural "aldermen," or unofficial "senators," whose presence extemporized for the occasion a sufficient court of testators. <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt perform the part of a kinsman, perform it.</span> The translation in King James's English version, and in many other versions, viz., "If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it," is somewhat out of harmony with the nature of the case. Naomi was not wishing Elimelech's estate to be redeemed. It was not yet in a position to be redeemed. It had not been alienated or sold. She wished for it not a redeemer, but a purchaser. And as it was the <span class="accented">right</span> of a <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> or kinsman to redeem for a reduced brother, if he was able and willing, the estate which had been sold to an alien (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>), so it was the <span class="accented">privilege</span> of the same <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> or kinsman to get, if the reduced brother was wishing to sell, the first offer of the estate. It would, in particular, be at variance with the prerogative of the nearest of kin if some other one in the circle of the kindred, but not so near, were to be offered on sale the usufructuary possession of the family estate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23, 27</a>). Hence Boaz recognized the prior prerogative of his anonymous relative and friend, and said to him, "If thou wilt perform the part of a kinsman, and buy the property, then buy it." It is added, <span class="cmt_word">and if he will not.</span> Note the use of the third person <span class="accented">he</span>, instead of the second <span class="accented">thou</span>. If the reading be correct, then Boaz, in thus speaking, must for the moment have turned to the witnesses so as to address them. That the reading is correct, notwithstanding that some MSS. and all the ancient versions exhibit the verb in the second person, is rendered probable by the very fact that <span class="accented">it is the difficult reading</span>. There could be no temptation for a transcriber to substitute the third person for the second; there would be temptation to substitute the second for the third. The unanimity of the ancient versions is probably attributable to the habit of neglecting absolute literality, and translating according to the sense, when the sense was clear. Boaz, turning back instantaneously to his relative, says, <span class="cmt_word">Make thou known to me, that I may know, for there is none besides thee to act the kinsman's part</span> <span class="cmt_word">(with the exception of myself), and I come after thee.</span> The little clause, "with the exception of myself," lies in the sense, or spirit, although not in the letter of Boaz's address, as reported in the text. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, I will act the kinsman's part.</span> He was glad to get the opportunity of adding to his own patrimonial possession the property that had belonged to Elimelech, and which Naomi, in her reduced condition, wished to dispose cf. So far all seemed to go straight against the interests of Ruth. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Ruth returned home, her mother-in-law asked her, "Who art thou?" i.e., as what person, in what circumstances dost thou come? The real meaning is, What hast thou accomplished? Whereupon she related all that the man had done (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-10.htm">Ruth 3:10-14</a>), and that he had given her six measures of barley for her mother. The Masorites have supplied &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; after &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/3-5.htm">Ruth 3:5</a>, but without any necessity. The mother-in-law drew from this the hope that Boaz would now certainly carry out the matter to the desired end. "Sit still," i.e., remain quietly at home (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-11.htm">Genesis 38:11</a>), "till thou hearest how the affair turn out," namely, whether the nearer redeemer mentioned by Boaz, or Boaz himself, would grant her the Levirate marriage. The expression "fall," in this sense, is founded upon the idea of the falling of the lot to the ground; it is different in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-20.htm">Ezra 7:20</a>. "For the man will not rest unless he has carried the affair to an end this day." &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1501;, except that, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-6.htm">Leviticus 22:6</a>, etc. (see Ewald, 356, b). </body></html>
