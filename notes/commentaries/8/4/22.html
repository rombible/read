She was a witness for God to the Gentile world, that he had not utterly forsaken them, but that in due time they should become one with his chosen people, and partake of his salvation. Prayer to God attended the marriage, and praise to him attended the birth of the child. What a pity it is that pious language should not be more used among Christians, or that it should be let fall into formality! Here is the descent of David from Ruth. And the period came when Bethlehem-Judah displayed greater wonders than those in the history of Ruth, when the outcast babe of another forlorn female of the same race appeared, controlling the counsels of the Roman master of the world, and drawing princes and wise men from the east, with treasures of gold, and frankincense, and myrrh to his feet. His name shall endure for ever, and all nations shall call Him blessed. In that Seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Salmon begat Boaz - Matthew has preserved the additional interesting information that the mother of Boaz was Rahab <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>; 6.

This appendix shows that the special object contemplated by the inspired author of this little book was to preserve the memory of an interesting domestic episode, and to trace the genealogy of David. There was an interval of three hundred eighty years between Salmon and David. It is evident that whole generations are omitted; the leading personages only are named, and grandfathers are said, in Scripture language, to beget their grandchildren, without specifying the intermediate links.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ruth/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> How can this be a true genealogy, seeing by this means four persons take up three hundred and eighty years, which were between Salmon and David, and consequently every one of them must beget a son when he was very old? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> 1. It is not certain that each of these was the immediate parent of him whom he is said to beget; for sometimes grandfathers are said in Scripture to beget their grandchildren, to wit, by the intervention of their immediate sons; whereof instances have been given. And sometimes in genealogies whole generations are omitted, as may appear by <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-2.htm" title="The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,">Ezra 7:2</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-3.htm" title="And the children of Amram; Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam.

There are many examples even in profane writers, both ancient and modern, of persons that have not only lived one hundred and twenty and one hundred and thirty years and upwards, but have been vigorous and have begotten children at above one hundred years old; and of women that have conceived and born children at the age of fifty, sixty, yea, seventy years. And therefore if it were so in these more ancient times, when men were longer lived, and under the law, when long life was expressly promised to the obedient, and in persons of strong constitutions and sober conversations, such as some of these are known to have been, and the others may justly be presumed to be such, it is not strange, nor in the least incredible. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ruth/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Obed begat Jesse,.... The Bethlehemite, the father of David: <p>and Jesse begat David; the Targum adds, the king of Israel; and so the Syriac and Arabic versions add, the king; from whence it is by some concluded that this book was written by Samuel, not only after the birth of David, but after he had been anointed king by him: here being but four generations mentioned, from the coming of the Israelites into Canaan, to the birth of David, which was three hundred and sixty years, each of the four persons, Salmon, Boaz, Obed, and Jesse, must beget a son when one hundred years old and upwards; and which is not at all incredible, as appears by instances in later times, and therefore not at all improbable, that in those ancient times men of sobriety and good constitutions should have children at such an age. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ruth/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ruth/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">and Jesse begat David</span>] The present genealogy was therefore designed to supply what 1 Sam. omitted, and to trace David’s descent from Perez.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Note on the genealogy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ruth/4-18.htm" title="Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,...">Ruth 4:18-22</a></span>. The following points are to be noticed: (1) The genealogy consists of ten members, of which the first five, from Perez to Nahshon, cover the period from the entry of the Hebrew tribes into Egypt (Perez, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-12.htm" title="And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.">Genesis 46:12</a>) to the time of Moses (Nahshon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-7.htm" title="Of Judah; Nahshon the son of Amminadab.">Numbers 1:7</a>); while the last five belong to the period of the settlement in Canaan. It is obvious that the generations are not sufficient to cover this extent of time; the grandfather of Boaz cannot have been a contemporary of Moses. The genealogy, therefore, does not attempt to give a complete historical series; many links are omitted; it is artificially constructed out of traditional materials. (2) The object of the list is to connect David with the princely line of Judah. In spite of his Moabite great-grandmother, he could be shewn to come of the best Judaean stock. How this was done is explained by Wellhausen (<span class="ital">De Gentibus et Familiis Judaeis</span>, pp. 13–19) as follows: the ancestors of David were known as far as Boaz, but there memory failed; accordingly, as Beth-lehem was the native town of Jesse, it was natural to introduce Salma, ‘the father of Beth-lehem’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-51.htm" title="Salma the father of Bethlehem, Hareph the father of Bethgader.">1 Chronicles 2:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-54.htm" title="The sons of Salma; Bethlehem, and the Netophathites, Ataroth, the house of Joab, and half of the Manahethites, the Zorites.">1 Chronicles 2:54</a>); then David must be connected with the leading family of Judah which flourished in the time of Moses, and, through the marriage of Aaron, united itself with the priestly dignity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-23.htm" title="And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bore him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.">Exodus 6:23</a>). This accounts for Nahshon and Amminadab; these again are traced to Ram, son or grandson of Hezron, whose very name (<span class="ital">Ram</span> = ‘the high one’) suggests the founder of a princely line. (3) The date at which the genealogy was drawn up Wellhausen further shews to be post-exilic. For Salma is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-51.htm" title="Salma the father of Bethlehem, Hareph the father of Bethgader.">1 Chronicles 2:51</a> as a son of Caleb, and the Calebites in ancient times belonged to the S. of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-20.htm" title="And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled there the three sons of Anak.">Jdg 1:20</a>); it was not until after the exile, when they found the Edomites in possession of their original seats, that they moved northwards to Beth-lehem and its neighbourhood; so that it was not until after the exile that Salma could be called ‘the father of Beth-lehem.’ David, however, is never connected with the Calebite district in the S. of Judah, but with the older part of Israel settled in Northern Judah, near the border of Benjamin. (4) The genealogy cannot have been framed by the author of Ruth, because he recognizes Obed as legally the son of Mahlon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-5.htm" title="Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.">Ruth 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-10.htm" title="Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day.">Ruth 4:10</a>); if he had drawn up the line himself he would have traced it through Mahlon and Elimelech. We may conclude, therefore, that the genealogy ‘forms no integral part of the Book, and may well have been added long after the Book itself was written in an age that was devoted to the study of pedigrees’ (Driver, <span class="ital">Introd.</span>8, pp. 455 f.). (5) The relation between this genealogy and the fuller one in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/2-10.htm" title="And Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon, prince of the children of Judah;...">1 Chronicles 2:10-17</a> cannot be determined with certainly; for, as sWellhausen has shewn (l.c.), <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/2-10.htm" title="And Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon, prince of the children of Judah;...">1 Chronicles 2:10-24</a> is a secondary element, and the same source from which the Chronicler derived <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/2-18.htm" title="And Caleb the son of Hezron begat children of Azubah his wife, and of Jerioth: her sons are these; Jesher, and Shobab, and Ardon....">1 Chronicles 2:18-24</a> may have contained <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ruth/4-10.htm" title="Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you are witnesses this day....">Ruth 4:10-17</a></span>, and it is quite possible that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ruth/4-18.htm" title="Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,...">Ruth 4:18-22</a> was also derived from it (Nowack). It is simplest to conclude, with Robertson Smith and Cheyne in <span class="ital">Encycl. Bibl.</span>, that a later writer borrowed the genealogy from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-25.htm" title="And the sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were, Ram the firstborn, and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, and Ahijah.">1 Chronicles 2:25</a> it stands.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Naomi therefore adopted this grandson as her own child; she took the boy into her bosom, and became his nurse.</body></html>
