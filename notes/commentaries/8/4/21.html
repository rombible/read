She was a witness for God to the Gentile world, that he had not utterly forsaken them, but that in due time they should become one with his chosen people, and partake of his salvation. Prayer to God attended the marriage, and praise to him attended the birth of the child. What a pity it is that pious language should not be more used among Christians, or that it should be let fall into formality! Here is the descent of David from Ruth. And the period came when Bethlehem-Judah displayed greater wonders than those in the history of Ruth, when the outcast babe of another forlorn female of the same race appeared, controlling the counsels of the Roman master of the world, and drawing princes and wise men from the east, with treasures of gold, and frankincense, and myrrh to his feet. His name shall endure for ever, and all nations shall call Him blessed. In that Seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Salmon begat Boaz - Matthew has preserved the additional interesting information that the mother of Boaz was Rahab <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>; 6. It is possible that the circumstance that the mother of Boaz was a Canaanite may have made him less indisposed to marry Ruth the Moabitess. As regards the whole genealogy in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-18.htm">Ruth 4:18-22</a>, it should be remarked that it occurs four times in Scripture, namely, here, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-10.htm">1 Chronicles 2:10-12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/1-3.htm">Matthew 1:3-6</a>; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-32.htm">Luke 3:32-33</a>, and is of course of singular importance as being the genealogy of our Lord. One or two difficulties in it still remain unsolved.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ruth/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18-22. these are the generations of Pharez&#8212;that is, his descendants. This appendix shows that the special object contemplated by the inspired author of this little book was to preserve the memory of an interesting domestic episode, and to trace the genealogy of David. There was an interval of three hundred eighty years between Salmon and David. It is evident that whole generations are omitted; the leading personages only are named, and grandfathers are said, in Scripture language, to beget their grandchildren, without specifying the intermediate links.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ruth/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ruth/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Salmon begat Boaz,....

Seven, as the number of the works of God, is used to denote a large number of sons of a mother whom God has richly blessed with children (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>). A mother of so many sons was to be congratulated, inasmuch as she not only possessed in these sons a powerful support to her old age, but had the prospect of the permanent continuance of her family. Naomi, however, had a still more valuable treasure in her mother-in-law, inasmuch as through her the loss of her own sons had been supplied in her old age, and the prospect was now presented to her of becoming in her childless old age the tribe-mother of a numerous and flourishing family.</body></html>
