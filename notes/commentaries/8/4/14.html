She was a witness for God to the Gentile world, that he had not utterly forsaken them, but that in due time they should become one with his chosen people, and partake of his salvation. Prayer to God attended the marriage, and praise to him attended the birth of the child. What a pity it is that pious language should not be more used among Christians, or that it should be let fall into formality! Here is the descent of David from Ruth. And the period came when Bethlehem-Judah displayed greater wonders than those in the history of Ruth, when the outcast babe of another forlorn female of the same race appeared, controlling the counsels of the Roman master of the world, and drawing princes and wise men from the east, with treasures of gold, and frankincense, and myrrh to his feet.

The inhabitants of Bethlehem, as they fell into her company; or perhaps these were the women that were called to the labour of Ruth, and attended the birth of the child: <p>blessed be the Lord, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman; a grandchild born to her that day. In Moab she was bereaved of her husband and of two sons; but now she is not left without a relation, a kinsman, and a redeemer, for which the women blessed God, and stirred her up to do the same. Alshech observes, that the women said, blessed be the Lord, because from him would spring the Messiah of the Lord, as did. Some refer this to Boaz, to whom the name of kinsman, or redeemer, more properly belonged; and who appeared to have done the office and duty of such an one, by redeeming the estate of his kinsman, and marrying his widow, the effect of which was, that a son was born, who would be heir of the estate; but the text speaks of what was done that day, and what is after said in the next verse all relates to the child born: <p>that his name may be famous in Israel; some refer this to the name of God, by whose providence this was brought about; others to Boaz, who was well spoken of for his charity, integrity, and humility, shown in redeeming the estate, and taking Ruth to wife; or rather it refers to the newborn child, of whom they express their hope and confidence, that when he came to man's estate would be very famous and honourable in Israel, being a worthy and virtuous man himself, and the progenitor of such illustrious persons as Jesse, David, &amp;c. and even of the Messiah. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ruth/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed <i>be</i> the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> his name may be famous in Israel.</span><p>(h) He shall leave continual posterity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ruth/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. On account of the words <span class="ital">this day</span>, Bertholet and Nowack take the <span class="ital">near kinsman</span> (<span class="ital">go’el</span>) as referring to the new-born son. It is true that the words which follow, ‘let his name be famous,’ apply to the child; but throughout the story the <span class="ital">near kinsman</span> is Boaz. He has done all, and more than all, that could be expected of a <span class="ital">go’el</span>; he has redeemed the property, and now (<span class="ital">this day</span>) he has secured an heir for Naomi’s family.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the women said to Naomi, Blessed he Yahveh, who has given thee a kinsman this day! May his name become famous in Israel.</span> Of course it is Ruth's son who is the kinsman referred to, the nearest kinsman, still nearer than Boaz. The kinsman was given, said the women, "this day," the day when the child was born. The expression which we have rendered, "who has given thee a kinsman," is, literally, "who has not caused to fail to thee a kinsman." The sympathetic women who had gathered together in Boaz's house were sanguine, or at least enthusiastically desirous, that a son so auspiciously given, after most peculiar antecedents, would yet become a famous name in Israel. Canon Cook supposes that the kinsman referred to by the women was not the child, but his father, Boaz ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">loc</span>.). Yet it is obvious that the kinsman specified was the one who, as they said, had been given, or had not been caused to fail, "that day." He was, moreover, the one of whom they went on to say, "May his name become famous in Israel, and may he be to thee a restorer of life, and for the support of thine old age," &c. Dr. <span class="accented">Cook's</span> objections are founded on a too narrow view of the functions devolving on, and of the privileges accruing to, a <span class="accented">goel</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This declaration he confirmed by what was a usual custom at that time in renouncing a right. This early custom is described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-7.htm">Ruth 4:7</a>, and there its application to the case before us is mentioned afterwards. "Now this was (took place) formerly in Israel in redeeming and exchanging, to confirm every transaction: A man took off his shoe and gave it to another, and this was a testimony in Israel." From the expression "formerly," and also from the description given of the custom in question, it follows that it had gone out of use at the time when our book was composed. The custom itself, which existed among the Indians and the ancient Germans, arose from the fact that fixed property was taken possession of by treading upon the soil, and hence taking off the shoe and handing it to another was a symbol of the transfer of a possession or right of ownership (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9</a> and my Bibl. Archol. ii. p. 66). The Piel &#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; is rarely met with in Hebrew; in the present instance it was probably taken from the old legal phraseology. The only other places in which it occurs are <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-6.htm">Ezekiel 13:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-28.htm">Psalm 119:28</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-106.htm">Psalm 119:106</a>, and the book of Esther, where it is used more frequently as a Chaldaism.</body></html>
