Thus many have a value for Christ, and yet come short of salvation by him, because they cannot find in their hearts to forsake other things for him. They love him, and yet leave him, because they do not love him enough, but love other things better.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 Naomi began to think of returning, after the death of her two sons. When death comes into a family, it ought to reform what is amiss there. Earth is made bitter to us, that heaven may be made dear. Naomi seems to have been a person of faith and piety. She dismissed her daughters-in-law with prayer. It is very proper for friends, when they part, to part with them thus part in love. Did Naomi do well, to discourage her daughters from going with her, when she might save them from the idolatry of Moab, and bring them to the faith and worship of the God of Israel? Naomi, no doubt, desired to do that; but if they went with her, she would not have them to go upon her account. Those that take upon them a profession of religion only to oblige their friends, or for the sake of company, will be converts of small value. If they did come with her, she would have them make it their deliberate choice, and sit down first and count the cost, as it concerns those to do who make a profession of religion. And more desire rest in the house of a husband, or some wordly settlement or earthly satisfaction, than the rest to which Christ invites our souls; therefore when tried they will depart from Christ, though perhaps with some sorrow.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The kiss at parting as well as at meeting is the customary friendly and respectful salutation in the East. The difference between mere kindness of manner and self-sacrificing love is most vividly depicted in the words and conduct of the two women. Ruth's determination is stedfast to cast in her lot with the people of the Lord (compare the marginal references and <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22-28</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ruth/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. the hand of the Lord is gone out against me&#8212;that is, I am not only not in a condition to provide you with other husbands, but so reduced in circumstances that I cannot think of your being subjected to privations with me. The arguments of Naomi prevailed with Orpah, who returned to her people and her gods. But Ruth clave unto her; and even in the pages of Sterne, that great master of pathos, there is nothing which so calls forth the sensibilities of the reader as the simple effusion he has borrowed from Scripture&#8212;of Ruth to her mother-in-law [Chalmers].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, </span> i.e. departed from with a kiss, as the manner was, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-28.htm" title="And have not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? you have now done foolishly in so doing.">Genesis 31:28</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-20.htm" title="And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray you, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.

Not being able to bear the thought of parting, or that they must be obliged to it: <p>and Orpah kissed her mother in law; gave her the parting kiss, as the Jews (e) call it; and which was used by other people (f); but not without affection to her, and took her leave of her, as her kiss testified, since it must be so; and being moved by her reasons, and having a greater inclination to her own country than Ruth had; of the kiss at parting, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-28.htm">Genesis 31:28</a>. <p>but Ruth clave unto her; hung about her, would not part from her, but cleaved unto her in body and mind; forsaking her own people, and her father's house; neither the thought of them, nor of her native country, nor of not having an husband, or any likelihood of it, nor of poverty and distress, had any manner of influence upon her, but determined she was to go and abide with her. <p>(e) Bereshit Rabba, sect. 70. fol. 62. 4.

Hence the propriety of the singular number, as in ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">And wept again.</span> The "again" doubles back on the statement in ver. 9. With uplifted voice, in shrill Oriental wail, and amid streams of tears, they bemoaned their hapless lot. Then, after the paroxysm of grief had somewhat spent itself, Orpah yielded to her mother-in-law's dissuasives, and at length imprinted on her, reluctantly and passionately, a farewell kiss. Then, not waiting to ascertain the ultimate decision of Ruth, or rather, perhaps, having now a fixed presentiment what it would be, she moved regretfully and tearfully away. She was afraid, perhaps, that if she, as well as Ruth, should insist on accompanying her mother-in-law, the two might be unreasonably burdensome to the aged widow. Perhaps, too, she was not without fear that her own burden in a foreign land, amid strangers, might be too heavy to be borne. There is not, however, the slightest need for supposing that she was, in any respect, deficient in attachment to her mother-in-law. <span class="cmt_word">But</span>, it is added, <span class="cmt_word">Ruth clave to her mother-in-law</span>, all reasonings, remonstrances, dissuasives on Naomi's part notwithstanding. Ruth would not be parted from her. "Clave." It is the same word that is used in the primitive law of marriage. "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall <span class="accented">cleave</span> to his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). It occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-8.htm">Psalm 63:8</a>: "My soul <span class="accented">followeth hard</span> after thee; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-31.htm">Psalm 119:31</a>: "<span class="accented">I</span> have <span class="accented">stuck</span> to thy testimonies." Joshua said, "Cleave unto the Lord thy God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/23-8.htm">Joshua 23:8</a>); and many have had sweet, while others have had bitter, experience of the truth that "there is a friend that <span class="accented">sticketh closer</span> than a brother" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 1:15-22. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"On the way," i.e., when they had gone a part of the way, Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go, return each one to her mother's house," - not her father's, though, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11</a>, Ruth's father at any rate was still living, but her mother's, because maternal love knows best how to comfort a daughter in her affliction. "Jehovah grant you that ye may find a resting-place, each one in the house of her husband," i.e., that ye may both be happily married again. She then kissed them, to take leave of them (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-28.htm">Genesis 31:28</a>). The daughters-in-law, however, began to weep aloud, and said, "We will return with thee to thy people" &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; before a direct statement serves to strengthen it, and is almost equivalent to a positive assurance. </body></html>
