With this Naomi yields; after so solemn a protest she can urge no more.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-18 See Ruth's resolution, and her good affection to Naomi. Orpah was loth to part from her; yet she did not love her well enough to leave Moab for her sake. Thus, many have a value and affection for Christ, yet come short of salvation by him, because they will not forsake other things for him. They love him, yet leave him, because they do not love him enough, but love other things better. Ruth is an example of the grace of God, inclining the soul to choose the better part. Naomi could desire no more than the solemn declaration Ruth made. See the power of resolution; it silences temptation. Those that go in religious ways without a stedfast mind, stand like a door half open, which invites a thief; but resolution shuts and bolts the door, resists the devil and forces him to flee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The kiss at parting as well as at meeting is the customary friendly and respectful salutation in the East. The difference between mere kindness of manner and self-sacrificing love is most vividly depicted in the words and conduct of the two women. Ruth's determination is stedfast to cast in her lot with the people of the Lord (compare the marginal references and <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22-28</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ruth/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. the hand of the Lord is gone out against me&#8212;that is, I am not only not in a condition to provide you with other husbands, but so reduced in circumstances that I cannot think of your being subjected to privations with me. The arguments of Naomi prevailed with Orpah, who returned to her people and her gods. But Ruth clave unto her; and even in the pages of Sterne, that great master of pathos, there is nothing which so calls forth the sensibilities of the reader as the simple effusion he has borrowed from Scripture&#8212;of Ruth to her mother-in-law [Chalmers].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ruth/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ruth/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Where thou diest will I die, and there will I be buried,.... She was determined to abide with her unto death, and not only was desirous to die as she did, but where she should die; in the same country, cottage, and bed, and be laid in the same grave, in hope of rising together at the resurrection of the just; having no regard at all to the sepulchres of her fathers, which people in all ages and countries have been fond of being laid in, as an honour and happiness. So with the Greeks and Romans, not only relations, but intimate friends, and such as had a strong affection for each other, were sometimes buried in the same grave, as Crates and Polemon (i), Paris and Oenome (k), and others (l); see <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, <p>the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me; this is the form of oath she used for confirmation of what she had said, and to put an end to the debate on this subject; what she imprecates upon herself is not expressed, should she otherwise do than what she swears to; leaving Naomi to supply it in her own mind, and as being what was not fit to be named, and the greatest evil that could be thought to befall a perjured person. <p>(i) Lart. in Vita Cratet.

When heathen utter this oath, <span class="ital">Elohim</span> is used instead of Jehovah, and the verbs are plural, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-2.htm" title="Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not your life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.">1 Kings 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-10.htm" title="And Benhadad sent to him, and said, The gods do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me.">1 Kings 20:10</a>. Lit. the phrase here runs ‘Jehovah do so to me, and more also—(only) death shall separate me from thee’; the substance of the oath is an assertion, not a negation; similarly <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-44.htm" title="And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for you shall surely die, Jonathan.">1 Samuel 14:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-13.htm" title="The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do you evil, then I will show it you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.">1 Samuel 20:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-23.htm" title="Then king Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.">1 Kings 2:23</a> etc. in the Hebr.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried.</span> She wished to be naturalized for life in Naomi's fatherland. Nor did she wish her remains to be conveyed back for burial to the land of her nativity. <span class="cmt_word">So may Yahveh do to me, and still more, but death only shall part me and thee.</span> She appeals to the God of the Israelites, the one universal God. She puts herself on oath, and invokes his severest penal displeasure if she should suffer anything less uncontrollable than death to part her from her mother-in-law. "So may Yahveh do to me." It was thus that the Hebrews made their most awful appeals to Yahveh. They signified their willingness to suffer some dire calamity if they should either do the  evil deed repudiated or fail to do the good deed promised. So stands in misty indefiniteness; not, as Fuller supposes, by way of "leaving it to the discretion of God Almighty to choose that arrow out of his quiver which he shall think it most fit to shoot," but as a kind of euphemism, or cloudy veil, two-thirds concealing, and one-third revealing, whatever horrid infliction could by dramatic sign be represented or hinted. <span class="accented">And still more - a</span> thoroughly Semitic idiom, <span class="accented">and so may he add</span> (<span class="accented">to do</span>)  There was first of all a full imprecation, and then an additional 'bittock,' to lend intensity to the asseveration. "<span class="accented">But</span> death only shall sever between me and thee!" Ruth's language is broken. Two formulas of imprecation are flung together. One, if complete, would have been to this effect: "So may Yahveh do to me, and so may he add to do, if (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) aught but death sever between me and thee!" The other, if complete, would have run thus: "<span class="accented">I</span> swear by Yahveh 'that' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) death, death only, shall part thee and me. In the original the word <span class="accented">death</span> has the article, <span class="accented">death emphatically</span>. It is as if she had said <span class="accented">death</span>, <span class="accented">the great divider</span>. The full idea is in substance <span class="accented">death alone</span>. This divider alone, says Ruth, "<span class="accented">shall</span> sever between me and thee;" literally, "<span class="accented">between</span> me and between thee," a Hebrew idiom, repeating for emphasis' sake the two-sided relationship, but taking the repetition in reverse order, <span class="accented">between me</span> (<span class="accented">and thee</span>) and <span class="accented">between thee</span> (<span class="accented">and me</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Naomi endeavoured to dissuade them from this resolution, by setting before them the fact, that if they went with her, there would be no hope of their being married again, and enjoying the pleasures of life once more. "Have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?" Her meaning is: I am not pregnant with sons, upon whom, as the younger brothers of Mahlon and Chilion, there would rest the obligation of marrying you, according to the Levitate law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>). And not only have I no such hope as this, but, continues Naomi, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-12.htm">Ruth 1:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-13.htm">Ruth 1:13</a>, I have no prospect of having a husband and being blessed with children: "for I am too old to have a husband;" year, even if I could think of this altogether improbable thing as taking place, and assume the impossible as possible; "If I should say, I have hope (of having a husband), yea, if I should have a husband to-night, and should even bear sons, would ye then wait till they were grown, would ye then abstain from having husbands?" The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (if) before &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; refers to both the perfects which follow. &#1500;&#1492;&#1503; is the third pers. plur. neuter suffix &#1492;&#1503; with the prefix &#1500;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-24.htm">Job 30:24</a>, where &#1492;&#1503; is pointed with seghol, on account of the toned syllable which follows, as here in pause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-9.htm">Ruth 1:9</a> : lit. in these things, in that case, and hence in the sense of therefore  equals  &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, as in Chaldee (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-6.htm">Daniel 2:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-9.htm">Daniel 2:9</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/2-24.htm">Daniel 2:24</a>, etc.). &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1490;&#1504;&#1492; (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-4.htm">Isaiah 60:4</a>, and Ewald, 195, a.), from &#1506;&#1490;&#1503; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. in Hebrew, which signifies in Aramaean to hold back, shut in; hence in the Talmud &#1506;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, a woman who lived retired in her own house without a husband. Naomi supposes three cases in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-12.htm">Ruth 1:12</a>, of which each is more improbable, or rather more impossible, than the one before; and even if the impossible circumstance should be possible, that she should bear sons that very night, she could not in that case expect or advise her daughters-in-law to wait till these sons were grown up and could marry them, according to the Levirate law. In this there was involved the strongest persuasion to her daughters-in-law to give up their intention of going with her into the land of Judah, and a most urgent appeal to return to their mothers' houses, where, as young widows without children, they would not be altogether without the prospect of marrying again. One possible case Naomi left without notice, namely, that her daughters-in-law might be able to obtain other husbands in Judah itself. She did not hint at this, in the first place, and perhaps chiefly, from delicacy on account of the Moabitish descent of her daughters-in-law, in which she saw that there would be an obstacle to their being married in the land of Judah; and secondly, because Naomi could not do anything herself to bring about such a connection, and wished to confine herself therefore to the one point of making it clear to her daughters that in her present state it was altogether out of her power to provide connubial and domestic happiness for them in the land of Judah. She therefore merely fixed her mind upon the different possibilities of a Levirate marriage.<p>(Note: The objections raised by J. B. Carpzov against explaining <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-12.htm">Ruth 1:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-13.htm">Ruth 1:13</a> as referring to a Levirate marriage, - namely, that this is not to be thought of, because a Levirate marriage was simply binding upon brothers of the deceased by the same father and mother, and upon brothers who were living when he died, and not upon those born afterwards-have been overthrown by Bertheau as being partly without foundation, and partly beside the mark. In the first place, the law relating to the Levirate marriage speaks only of brothers of the deceased, by which, according to the design of this institution, we must certainly think of sons by one father, but not necessarily the sons by the same mother. Secondly, the law does indeed expressly require marriage with the sister-in-law only of a brother who should be in existence when her husband died, but it does not distinctly exclude a brother born afterwards; and this is the more evident from the fact that, according to the account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-11.htm">Genesis 38:11</a>, this duty was binding upon brothers who were not grown up at the time, as soon as they should be old enough to marry. Lastly, Naomi merely says, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-12.htm">Ruth 1:12</a>, that she was not with child by her deceased husband; and when she does take into consideration, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-12.htm">Ruth 1:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-13.htm">Ruth 1:13</a>, the possibility of a future pregnancy, she might even then be simply thinking of an alliance with some brother of her deceased husband, and therefore of sons who would legally be regarded as sons of Elimelech. When Carpzov therefore defines the meaning of her words in this manner, "I have indeed no more children to hope for, to whom I could marry you in time, and I have no command over others," the first thought does not exhaust the meaning of the words, and the last is altogether foreign to the text.)<p>&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;, "not my daughters," i.e., do not go with me; "for it has gone much more bitterly with me than with you." &#1502;&#1512;&#1512; relates to her mournful lot. &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; is comparative, "before you;" not "it grieveth me much on your account," for which &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; would be used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-26.htm">2 Samuel 1:26</a>. Moreover, this thought would not be in harmony with the following clause: "for the hand of the Lord has gone out against me," i.e., the Lord has sorely smitten me, namely by taking away not only my husband, but also my two sons. </body></html>
