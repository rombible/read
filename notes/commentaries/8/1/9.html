When death comes into a family, it ought to reform what is amiss there. Earth is made bitter to us, that heaven may be made dear. Naomi seems to have been a person of faith and piety. She dismissed her daughters-in-law with prayer. It is very proper for friends, when they part, to part with them thus part in love. Did Naomi do well, to discourage her daughters from going with her, when she might save them from the idolatry of Moab, and bring them to the faith and worship of the God of Israel? Naomi, no doubt, desired to do that; but if they went with her, she would not have them to go upon her account. Those that take upon them a profession of religion only to oblige their friends, or for the sake of company, will be converts of small value. If they did come with her, she would have them make it their deliberate choice, and sit down first and count the cost, as it concerns those to do who make a profession of religion. And more desire rest in the house of a husband, or some wordly settlement or earthly satisfaction, than the rest to which Christ invites our souls; therefore when tried they will depart from Christ, though perhaps with some sorrow.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Accompanying their mother-in-law to the borders of their own land would probably be an act of Oriental courtesy. Naomi with no less courtesy presses them to return. The mention of the mother's house, which the separation of the women's house or tent from that of the men facilitates, is natural in her mouth, and has more tenderness in it than father's house would have had; it does not imply the death of their fathers <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ruth/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

He was the God not of the Hebrews only, but of the Gentiles likewise, and rifled and overruled in Moab. The prayer is, in its form, full of syntactical peculiarity: "May Yahveh give to you," and, as the result of his giving, "may you find rest, each [in] the house of her husband." The expression, "the house of her husband," is used locatively. It is an answer to the suppressed question, "Where are they to find rest?" And hence, in our English idiom, we must insert the preposition, "in the house of her husband." As to the substance of the prayer, it has, as truly as the grammatical syntax, its own tinge of Orientalism. Young females in Moab had but little scope for a life of usefulness and happiness, unless shielded round and round within the home of a pure and devoted husband. Naomi was well aware of this, and hence, in her motherly solicitude for her virtuous daughters-in-law, she gave them to understand that it would be the opposite of a grief to her if they should seek, in the one way open to them in that comparatively undeveloped state of society, to brighten the homes of the lonely. In such homes, it circumstances were propitious, they would find deliverance from unrest and anxiety. They would find <span class="accented">rest</span>. It would be a position in which they could <span class="accented">abide</span>, and in which their tenderest feelings and most honorable desires would find satisfaction and <span class="accented">repose</span>. The peculiar force of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is finely displayed by the texture of the associated expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17, 18</a>: "<span class="accented">And</span> the work of righteousness shall be <span class="accented">peace</span>; and the effect of righteousness <span class="accented">quietness</span> and <span class="accented">assurance forever</span>; and my people shall dwell in <span class="accented">a peaceable habitation</span>, and in <span class="accented">sure dwellings</span>, and in <span class="accented">quiet resting-places"</span>  (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And she kissed them,</span> locking them lingeringly and lovingly in a farewell embrace. "<span class="accented">Kissed</span> them." The preposition <span class="accented">to</span>, according to the customary Hebrew idiom, <span class="accented">stands</span> before the pronoun. In kissing, Naomi imparted herself passionately <span class="accented">to</span> her beloved daughters-in-law, and clung <span class="accented">to</span> them. There would be full-hearted reciprocation, and each to each would cling "in their embracement, as they grew together" (Shakespeare, <span class="accented">Henry VIII</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And they lifted up their voice and wept.</span> The idea is not that all three wept aloud. The pronoun "they" refers to the daughters-in-law, as is evident both from the preceding and from the succeeding context. The fine idiomatic version of the Vulgate brings out successfully and unambiguously the true state of the <span class="accented">case - quae elevata voce flere coeperunt</span>. The <span class="accented">lifting</span>, <span class="accented">up of the voice</span> in weeping must be thought of according to the measure of Oriental, as distinguished from Occidental, custom. In the East there is less self-restraint in this matter than in the West. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, the plural of &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;, an adjective formation, not from &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5</a>, but from &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-7.htm">Genesis 48:7</a>) or &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>), the old name for Bethlehem, Ephrathite, i.e., sprung from Bethlehem, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>. The names - Elimelech, i.e., to whom God is King; Naomi (&#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;, a contraction of &#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;, lxx &#x39d;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;, Vulg. Nomi), i.e., the gracious; Machlon, i.e., the weakly; and Chilion, pining - are genuine Hebrew names; whereas the names of the Moabitish women, Orpah and Ruth, who were married to Elimelech's sons, cannot be satisfactorily explained from the Hebrew, as the meaning given to Orpah, "turning the back," is very arbitrary, and the derivation of Ruth from &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, a friend, is quite uncertain. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-10.htm">Ruth 4:10</a>, Ruth was the wife of the elder son Mahlon. Marriage with daughters of the Moabites was not forbidden in the law, like marriages with Canaanitish women (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>); it was only the reception of Moabites into the congregation of the Lord that was forbidden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>).</body></html>
