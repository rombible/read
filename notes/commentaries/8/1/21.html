Afflictions will make great and surprising changes in a little time. May God, by his grace, fit us for all such changes, especially the great change!, Naomi signifies pleasant, or amiable; Mara, bitter, or bitterness. She was now a woman of a sorrowful spirit. She had come home empty, poor, a widow and childless. But there is a fulness for believers of which they never can be emptied; a good part which shall not be taken from those who have it. The cup of affliction is a bitter cup, but she owns that the affliction came from God. It well becomes us to have our hearts humbled under humbling providences. It is not affliction itself, but affliction rightly borne, that does us good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord hath testified against me - The phrase is very commonly applied to a man who gives witness concerning (usually against) another in a court of justice <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-16.htm">2 Samuel 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>.

Of my husband and children, as the Targum; of children and riches, as Aben Ezra and Jarchi; wherefore some Jewish writers blame her and her husband for going abroad at such a time, and ascribe it to a covetous disposition, and an unwillingness to relieve the poor that came to them in their distress, and therefore got out of the way of them, on account of which they were punished, so Jarchi on <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-1.htm">Ruth 1:1</a>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-15.htm">Judges 2:15</a> but this is said without any just cause or reason that appears: <p>and the Lord hath brought me home again empty: deprived of her husband, children, and substance; she acknowledges the hand of God in it, and seems not to murmur at it, but to submit to it quietly, and bear it patiently: <p>why then call ye me Naomi; when there is nothing pleasant and agreeable in me, nor in my circumstances: <p>seeing the Almighty hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me? had bore witness that that was not a name suitable for her; or that she had sinned, and had not done what was well pleasing in his sight, as appeared by his afflicting her; she seemed therefore to be humbled under a sense of sin, and to consider afflictions as coming from the Lord on account of it, and submitted to his sovereign will; the affliction she means was the loss of her husband, children, and substance; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-17.htm">Job 10:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ruth/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ruth/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">hath testified against me</span>] i. e. hath marked His displeasure by the misfortunes which have overtaken me; for the idiom cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-30.htm" title="Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.">Numbers 35:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm" title="Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.">1 Samuel 12:3</a>. The Targ. characteristically moralizes: it was on account of Naomi’s sin (in migrating to a heathen country). The LXX. and Vulg., pronouncing the verb differently, render <span class="ital">hath humbled me</span>, but against the Hebr. construction. Underlying the words is the conviction, so deeply rooted in the Hebrew mind, that all must go well with the righteous and that misfortune was a sign of Jehovah’s wrath.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I went forth full, and Yahveh has caused me to return in emptiness. Why should you call me Naomi, and Yahveh has  testified against me, and the Almighty has brought evil upon me?</span> She went forth "full," with husband and sons, not to speak of goods. She was under the necessity of returning <span class="accented">in emptiness</span>, or <span class="accented">with empty</span> hands. The Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> does not exactly mean <span class="accented">empty</span>, as it is rendered in the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and King James's version. It is not an adjective, but an adverb, <span class="accented">emptily</span>. This lamentable change of circumstances she attributed to the action of Yahveh. He had, she believed, been testifying against her by means of the trials through which she had passed. She was right in a certain conditional acceptation of her language; but only on <span class="accented">condition of that condition</span>. And, let us condition her declarations as we may, she was probably in danger of making the same mistake concerning herself and her trials which was made by Job's comforters in reference to the calamities by which he was overwhelmed. In so far as <span class="accented">penal evil is</span> concerned, it may be traced directly or circuitously to the will and government of God. "<span class="accented">Shall</span> there be <span class="accented">evil -</span> that is, penal evil - in a city, and the Lord hath not done it?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>). But <span class="accented">there are many sufferings that are not penal</span>. The evil that is penal is only one segment of physical evil; and then there is besides, metaphysical evil, or the evil that consists in the inevitable imperfection of finite being. It is noteworthy that the participle of the Hiphilic verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> employed by Naomi is always translated in King James s version <span class="accented">evil doer</span>, or <span class="accented">wicked doer</span>, or <span class="accented">evil</span>, or <span class="accented">wicked</span>, Naomi, in using such a term, and applying it to Yahveh, was walking on a theological precipice, where it is not needful that we should accompany her. Instead of the literal expression, '<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">Yahveh</span>, we may, with our English wealth of conjunctions freely say, '<span class="accented">when</span> <span class="accented">Yahveh</span>. There is a charm in the original simplicity. There is likewise a charm in the more complex structure of the free translation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To the repeated entreaty of Naomi that she would follow her sister-in-law and return to her people and her God, Ruth replied: "Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return away behind thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou stayest, I will stay; thy people is my people, and thy God my God! where thou diest, I will die, and there will I be buried. Jehovah do so to me, and more also (lit. and so may He add to do)! Death alone shall divide between me and thee." The words &#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507; ... &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; are a frequently recurring formula in connection with an oath (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-44.htm">1 Samuel 14:44</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a>, etc.), by which the person searing called down upon himself a severe punishment in case he should not keep his word or carry out his resolution. The following &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is not a particle used in swearing instead of &#1488;&#1501; in the sense of "if," equivalent to "surely not," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12</a>, in the oath which precedes the formula, but answer to &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; in the sense of quod introducing the declaration, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-23.htm">1 Kings 2:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>, etc., signifying, I swear that death, and nothing else than death, shall separate us. Naomi was certainly serious in her intentions, and sincere in the advice which she gave to Ruth, and did not speak in this way merely to try her and put the state of her heart to the proof, "that it might be made manifest whether she would adhere stedfastly to the God of Israel and to herself, despising temporal things and the hope of temporal possessions' (Seb. Schmidt). She had simply the earthly prosperity of her daughter-in-law in her mind, as she herself had been shaken in her faith in the wonderful ways and gracious guidance of the faithful covenant God by the bitter experience of her own life.<p>(Note: "She thought of earthly things alone; and as at that time the Jews almost universally were growing lax in the worship of God, so she, having spent ten years among the Moabites, though it of little consequence whether they adhered to the religion of their fathers, to which they had been accustomed from their infancy or went over to the Jewish religion." - Carpzov.)<p>With Ruth, however, it was evidently not merely strong affection and attachment by which she felt herself so drawn to her mother-in-law that she wished to live and die with her, but a leaning of her heart towards the God of Israel and His laws, of which she herself was probably not yet fully conscious, but which she had acquired so strongly in her conjugal relation and her intercourse with her Israelitish connections, that it was her earnest wish never to be separated from this people and its God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-11.htm">Ruth 2:11</a>). </body></html>
