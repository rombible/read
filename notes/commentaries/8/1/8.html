When death comes into a family, it ought to reform what is amiss there. Earth is made bitter to us, that heaven may be made dear. Naomi seems to have been a person of faith and piety. She dismissed her daughters-in-law with prayer. It is very proper for friends, when they part, to part with them thus part in love. Did Naomi do well, to discourage her daughters from going with her, when she might save them from the idolatry of Moab, and bring them to the faith and worship of the God of Israel? Naomi, no doubt, desired to do that; but if they went with her, she would not have them to go upon her account. Those that take upon them a profession of religion only to oblige their friends, or for the sake of company, will be converts of small value. If they did come with her, she would have them make it their deliberate choice, and sit down first and count the cost, as it concerns those to do who make a profession of religion. And more desire rest in the house of a husband, or some wordly settlement or earthly satisfaction, than the rest to which Christ invites our souls; therefore when tried they will depart from Christ, though perhaps with some sorrow.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Accompanying their mother-in-law to the borders of their own land would probably be an act of Oriental courtesy.

She acknowledged that most kindly had they acted toward her. Her heart was filled with gratitude. It was likewise agitated with grief at the prospect of bidding them a final farewell, Nevertheless, she felt that it would be unreasonable and unkind to invite them to be, to any further degree, sharers of her adversity. Hence, thanking them for their loving convoy, she would remind them that every step further on would only increase the length of their return-journey; and she said, Go, return each to her mother's home. There, in the females' apartment, and in the bosom of their mothers, they would surely find a welcome and a refuge. She judges of their mothers by herself, and she refers rather to them than to their fathers, partly, perhaps, because she bears in mind her own motherhood, but principally, no doubt, because, in those Oriental countries, it lay very particularly within the province of mothers to make arrangements in reference to their daughters. <span class="cmt_word">May Yahveh deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the deceased, and with me.</span> It is beautiful gratitude, and at the same time a touching monument to the faithfulness and gentleness that had characterized and adorned the young widows. Her simple Hebrew theology, moreover, comes finely out. She assumes that her own Yahveh reigned in Moab as in Judah, and that all blessing descended from him. There is a little peculiarity in the Hebrew pronouns in this clause. They are masculine instead of feminine. The influence of the stronger sex overrides grammatically, for the moment, the influence of the weaker. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, the plural of &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;, an adjective formation, not from &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5</a>, but from &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-7.htm">Genesis 48:7</a>) or &#1488;&#1508;&#1512;&#1514;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-11.htm">Ruth 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>), the old name for Bethlehem, Ephrathite, i.e., sprung from Bethlehem, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-12.htm">1 Samuel 17:12</a>.

According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/4-10.htm">Ruth 4:10</a>, Ruth was the wife of the elder son Mahlon. Marriage with daughters of the Moabites was not forbidden in the law, like marriages with Canaanitish women (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>); it was only the reception of Moabites into the congregation of the Lord that was forbidden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>).</body></html>
