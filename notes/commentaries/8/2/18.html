Ruth was pleased with what she gained by her own industry, and was careful to secure it. Let us thus take care that we lose not those things which we have wrought, which we have gained for our souls' good, 2Jo 1:8. Parents should examine their children, as Naomi did, not to frighten or discourage them, so as to make them hate home, or tempt them to tell a lie; but to commend them if they have done well, and with mildness to reprove and caution them if they have done otherwise. It is a good question for us to ask ourselves every night, Where have I gleaned to-day? What improvement have I made in knowledge and grace? What have I done that will turn to a good account? When the Lord deals bountifully with us, let us not be found in any other field, nor seeking for happiness and satisfaction in the creature. We lose Divine favours, if we slight them. Ruth dutifully observed her mother's directions. And when the harvest was ended, she kept her aged mother company at home. Dinah went out to see the daughters of the land; her vanity ended in disgrace, Ge 34. Ruth kept at home, and helped to maintain her mother, and went out on no other errand than to get provision for her; her humility and industry ended in preferment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And beat out that she had gleaned - Namely, with a stick, as the word implies (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-20.htm">Deuteronomy 24:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>).

She did eat as much as she desired of what she had gleaned, and her mother, as I suppose, with her, and the residue she gave to her mother to lay up for future use. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ruth/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she took it up,.... The ephah of barley, into her arms, or on her shoulders: <p>and went into the city; the city of Bethlehem: <p>and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: she set it down before her, and she looked at it with admiration, that she should glean so much in one day: <p>and she brought forth; not Naomi, as Josephus (k) represents it, who understood it as if she brought forth some food her neighbours had brought her, part of which she kept for Ruth, though he takes it in the other sense also; but the meaning is, that Ruth brought forth out of a scrip, as the Targum adds; besides the ephah of barley she set before her, she brought some victuals out of a bag: <p>and gave to her, that she had reserved after she was sufficed; not that she ate of the barley, and her mother-in-law also; and then she gave her the rest to lay up against another time, as some interpret it; but the remainder of the food which Boaz gave her at dinner time, which she could not eat, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a> she reserved for her mother, and now gave it to her; an instance of that piety commended by the apostle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm">1 Timothy 5:4</a>. <p>(k) Antiqu l. 5. c. 9. sect. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ruth/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And she took <i>it</i> up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she <i>g}</span> brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.</span><p>(g) That is, from her bag, as it is in the Chaldee text.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ruth/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">her mother in law saw</span>] A slight change of pronunciation gives a more expressive sense: <span class="ital">she shewed her mother in law</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ruth/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she lifted it up, and went into the city: and her mother-in-law beheld what she had gleaned.</span> <span class="cmt_word">She likewise brought forth, and gave to her, what she had left over after she was satisfied.</span> It would be with gratitude and pride that Ruth would let her heavy burden slip off into the hands of Naomi.

Other gentle emotions would stir within the mother-in-law's hungry heart when her beloved daughter-in-law produced and presented the remains of her delightfully refreshing repast at the tent.

"The Lord recompense thy work, and let thy reward be perfect (recalling <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>) from the Lord the God of Israel, to whom thou hast come to seek refuge under His wings!" For this figurative expression, which is derived from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-4.htm">Psalm 91:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-2.htm">Psalm 57:2</a>. In these words of Boaz we see the genuine piety of a true Israelite. </body></html>
