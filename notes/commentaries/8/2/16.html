What a noble pattern have we here to instruct us in what manner to bestow benefits, namely, so as to spare those whom we oblige the confusion of receiving, and ourselves the temptation of vain glory in giving.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:4-16 The pious and kind language between Boaz and his reapers shows that there were godly persons in Israel. Such language as this is seldom heard in our field; too often, on the contrary, what is immoral and corrupt. A stranger would form a very different opinion of our land, from that which Ruth would form of Israel from the converse and conduct of Boaz and his reapers. But true religion will teach a man to behave aright in all states and conditions; it will form kind masters and faithful servants, and cause harmony in families. True religion will cause mutual love and kindness among persons of different ranks. It had these effects on Boaz and his men. When he came to them he prayed for them. They did not, as soon as he was out of hearing curse him, as some ill-natured servants that hate their master's eye, but they returned his courtesy. Things are likely to go on well where there is such good-will as this between masters and servants. They expressed their kindness to each other by praying one for another. Boaz inquired concerning the stranger he saw, and ordered her to be well treated. Masters must take care, not only that they do no hurt themselves, but that they suffer not their servants and those under them to do wrong. Ruth humbly owned herself unworthy of favours, seeing she was born and brought up a heathen. It well becomes us all to think humbly of ourselves, esteeming others better than ourselves. And let us, in the kindness of Boaz to Ruth, note the kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ to poor sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To dip the morsel, or sop, whether it were bread or meat, in the dish containing the vinegar (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-20.htm">Mark 14:20</a> : <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-29.htm">Exodus 25:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-13.htm">Numbers 7:13</a>) was, and still is, the common custom in the East.<p>Parched or "roasted" corn - Grain was the common food of the country then (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-17.htm">1 Samuel 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>) as it is now.<p>And left - Or "reserved" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-18.htm">Ruth 2:18</a>.

One may judge, then, of the large quantity which Ruth would gather in consequence of the liberal orders given to the servants. These extraordinary marks of favor were not only given from a kindly disposition, but from regard to her good character and devoted attachment to her venerable relative.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ruth/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ruth/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And let fall some of the handfuls on purpose for her,....

He gives additional injunctions in her favor, both to the young men and to the maidens, though the line of distinction between the two sexes dips at times entirely out of sight. When the sheaf-makers had gathered an armful of stalks, and there seemed to be so clean a sweep that none were left behind, then they were of set purpose (<span class="accented">de industria</span>) to draw out some from the bunches or bundles, and leave them lying. The act of deliberate, as opposed to unintentional, drawing, is expressed by the emphatic repetition of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>. The verb thus repeated was a puzzle to the older expositors, inclusive of all the Hebrew commentators. But comparative philology has clearly determined its radical import, and thus illuminated its use in the passage before us. It does not here mean "spoil," though that is its usual signification. Nor can it mean "let fall," as in King James's version. It means <span class="accented">draw out</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Do not find fault with her.</span> The word is almost always rendered <span class="accented">rebuke</span> in our English version; but the force of the preposition may be represented thus: "do not chide 'with' her." "It was," says Dr. Andrew Thomson, "a thoughtful and delicate form of kindness to Ruth, thus to increase her gleanings, and yet to make them all appear the fruit of her own industry.... There are persons to be met with in social life who, while possessing the more solid qualities of moral excellence, are singularly deficient in the more graceful. They have honesty, but they have no sensibility; they have truth, but they are strangely wanting in tenderness. They are distinguished by <span class="accented">whatsoever things are just and pure</span>, but not by those which are <span class="accented">lovely and of good report</span>. You have the marble column, but you have not the polish or the delicate tracery on its surface; you have the rugged oak, but you miss the jasmine or the honeysuckle creeping gracefully around it from its roots. But the conduct of Boaz, as we stand and hear him giving these directions to his reapers, proves the compatibility of those two forms of excellence, and how the strong and the amiable may meet and harmonies in the same character. Indeed, they <span class="accented">do</span> always meet in the highest forms of moral greatness" ('Studies on the Book of Ruth,' pp. 119, 120). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ruth/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Deeply affected by this generosity, Ruth fell upon her face, bowing down to the ground (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-23.htm">1 Samuel 25:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-7.htm">Genesis 23:7</a>), to thank him reverentially, and said to Boaz, "Why have I found favour in thine eyes, that thou regardest me, who am only a stranger?" &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, to look at with sympathy or care, to receive a person kindly (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-19.htm">Ruth 2:19</a>). </body></html>
