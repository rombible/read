She is “the (rather “a”) Moabitish damsel,” she is a foreigner [as such she had a <span class= "ital">special </span>claim to the gleaning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/19-9.htm" title="And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>]. She is the daughter-in-law of Naomi; and he adds that her behaviour has been praiseworthy, for she asked leave before beginning to glean, and she has worked hard all day, save for a short interval of rest. It would seem that Boaz’s visit to the field fell at the time when Ruth was thus resting: “This is her tarrying for a little in the house”; apparently, that is, some rude shelter from the heat set up in the field, like the <span class= "ital">lodge </span>of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-8.htm" title="And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.">Isaiah 1:8</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ruth/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:4-16 The pious and kind language between Boaz and his reapers shows that there were godly persons in Israel. Such language as this is seldom heard in our field; too often, on the contrary, what is immoral and corrupt. A stranger would form a very different opinion of our land, from that which Ruth would form of Israel from the converse and conduct of Boaz and his reapers. But true religion will teach a man to behave aright in all states and conditions; it will form kind masters and faithful servants, and cause harmony in families. True religion will cause mutual love and kindness among persons of different ranks. It had these effects on Boaz and his men. When he came to them he prayed for them. They did not, as soon as he was out of hearing curse him, as some ill-natured servants that hate their master's eye, but they returned his courtesy. Things are likely to go on well where there is such good-will as this between masters and servants. They expressed their kindness to each other by praying one for another. Boaz inquired concerning the stranger he saw, and ordered her to be well treated. Masters must take care, not only that they do no hurt themselves, but that they suffer not their servants and those under them to do wrong. Ruth humbly owned herself unworthy of favours, seeing she was born and brought up a heathen. It well becomes us all to think humbly of ourselves, esteeming others better than ourselves. And let us, in the kindness of Boaz to Ruth, note the kindness of the Lord Jesus Christ to poor sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ruth/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A kinsman - More literally "an acquaintance"; here (and in the feminine, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/3-2.htm">Ruth 3:2</a>) denoting the person with whom one is intimately acquainted, one's near relation.

When they arrived, the whole town was in commotion on their account (&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, imperf. Niph. of &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-5.htm">1 Samuel 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-45.htm">1 Kings 1:45</a>). They said, "Is this Naomi?" The subject to &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; is the inhabitants of the town, but chiefly the female portion of the inhabitants, who were the most excited at Naomi's return. This is the simplest way of explaining the use of the feminine in the verbs &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1492;. In these words there was an expression of amazement, not so much at the fact that Naomi was still alive, and had come back again, as at her returning in so mournful a condition, as a solitary widow, without either husband or sons; for she replied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-20.htm">Ruth 1:20</a>), "Call me not Naomi (i.e., gracious), but Marah" (the bitter one), i.e., one who has experienced bitterness, "for the Almighty has made it very bitter to me. I, I went away full, and Jehovah has made me come back again empty. Why do ye call me Naomi, since Jehovah testifies against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me? "Full," i.e., rich, not in money and property, but in the possession of a husband and two sons; a rich mother, but now deprived of all that makes a mother's heart rich, bereft of both husband and sons. "Testified against me," by word and deed (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-16.htm">2 Samuel 1:16</a>). The rendering "He hath humbled me" (lxx, Vulg., Bertheau, etc.) is incorrect, as &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; with &#1489;&#1468; and the construct state simply means to trouble one's self with anything (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>), which is altogether unsuitable here. - With <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-22.htm">Ruth 1:22</a> the account of the return of Naomi and her daughter-in-law is brought to a close, and the statement that "they came to Bethlehem in the time of the barley harvest" opens at the same time the way for the further course of the history. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; is pointed as a third pers. perf. with the article in a relative sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-6.htm">Ruth 2:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-3.htm">Ruth 4:3</a>. Here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-6.htm">Ruth 2:6</a> it applies to Ruth; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-3.htm">Ruth 4:3</a> to Naomi. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, the masculine, is used here, as it frequently is, for the feminine &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, as being the more common gender. The harvest, as a whole, commenced with the barley harvest (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10-11</a>). </body></html>
