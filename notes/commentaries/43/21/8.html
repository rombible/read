It is good for the disciples of Christ to be together in common conversation, and common business. The hour for their entering upon action was not come. They would help to maintain themselves, and not be burdensome to any. Christ's time of making himself known to his people, is when they are most at a loss. He knows the temporal wants of his people, and has promised them not only grace sufficient, but food convenient. Divine Providence extends itself to things most minute, and those are happy who acknowledge God in all their ways. Those who are humble, diligent, and patient, though their labours may be crossed, shall be crowned; they sometimes live to see their affairs take a happy turn, after many struggles. And there is nothing lost by observing Christ's orders; it is casting the net on the right side of the ship. Jesus manifests himself to his people by doing that for them which none else can do, and things which they looked not for. He would take care that those who left all for him, should not want any good thing. And latter favours are to bring to mind former favours, that eaten bread may not be forgotten. He whom Jesus loved was the first that said, It is the Lord. John had cleaved most closely to his Master in his sufferings, and knew him soonest. Peter was the most zealous, and reached Christ the first. How variously God dispenses his gifts, and what difference there may be between some believers and others in the way of their honouring Christ, yet they all may be accepted of him! Others continue in the ship, drag the net, and bring the fish to shore, and such persons ought not to be blamed as worldly; for they, in their places, are as truly serving Christ as the others. The Lord Jesus had provision ready for them. We need not be curious in inquiring whence this came; but we may be comforted at Christ's care for his disciples. Although there were so many, and such great fishes, yet they lost none, nor damaged their net. The net of the gospel has enclosed multitudes, yet it is as strong as ever to bring souls to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two hundred cubits - About 350 feet, or a little more than 20 rods. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. the other disciples came in a little ship&#8212;by ship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The other disciples came in a little fishing boat, dragging the net with fishes; probably, because it was too heavy to be lifted up into the boat. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the other disciples came in a little ship,....

That this preparation for the breakfast to be given was made by <span class="ital">Jesus</span>, would be understood by the reader as matter of course (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/21-12.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord....">John 21:12-13</a>). But how He brought together the materials, and who kindled the fire, cannot be determined; He might, before He called to the disciples, have Himself, or by other hands, made the preparations. Hence the narrative yields no <span class="ital">miracle</span> (bringing forth out of nothing, thought Chrysostom, Theophylact, Euth. Zigabenus, Grotius, Calovius, Maldonatus, and several others; but Nicephorus, Jansen, Luthardt: the <span class="ital">angels</span> had provided Him therewith; finally, Hengstenberg, Godet: without more precise definition of the marvellous <span class="ital">How</span>), nor even the <span class="ital">appearance</span> of such (Lücke). But <span class="ital">wherefore</span> did Jesus make this <span class="ital">preparation?</span> Because the disciples were to eat <span class="ital">with Him</span> the early meal, with which He designed to connect so significant a transaction as that related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm" title="So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these?

Much that is irrelevant in the older expositors. According to Luthardt, the design is to depict how Jesus, without requiring their aid, knows how to feed the disciples from His own resources. But to what purpose any such further representation, since He had long ago miraculously fed thousands before the eyes of the disciples?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-8.htm" title="And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,) dragging the net with fishes.">John 21:8</a>.
