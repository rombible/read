The name is found only in St. John.<p>(1) The impression that St. John would not die belongs to the period when the Second Advent was looked for as within the limits of lifetime.

Wherefore when they were come to their respective homes, and were employed in their former occupation of fishing, Jesus showed himself to them, as is related in the following verses.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-14 Christ makes himself known to his people, usually in his ordinances; but sometimes by his Spirit he visits them when employed in their business. It is good for the disciples of Christ to be together in common conversation, and common business. The hour for their entering upon action was not come. They would help to maintain themselves, and not be burdensome to any. Christ's time of making himself known to his people, is when they are most at a loss. He knows the temporal wants of his people, and has promised them not only grace sufficient, but food convenient. Divine Providence extends itself to things most minute, and those are happy who acknowledge God in all their ways. Those who are humble, diligent, and patient, though their labours may be crossed, shall be crowned; they sometimes live to see their affairs take a happy turn, after many struggles. And there is nothing lost by observing Christ's orders; it is casting the net on the right side of the ship. Jesus manifests himself to his people by doing that for them which none else can do, and things which they looked not for. He would take care that those who left all for him, should not want any good thing. And latter favours are to bring to mind former favours, that eaten bread may not be forgotten. He whom Jesus loved was the first that said, It is the Lord. John had cleaved most closely to his Master in his sufferings, and knew him soonest. Peter was the most zealous, and reached Christ the first. How variously God dispenses his gifts, and what difference there may be between some believers and others in the way of their honouring Christ, yet they all may be accepted of him! Others continue in the ship, drag the net, and bring the fish to shore, and such persons ought not to be blamed as worldly; for they, in their places, are as truly serving Christ as the others. The Lord Jesus had provision ready for them. We need not be curious in inquiring whence this came; but we may be comforted at Christ's care for his disciples. Although there were so many, and such great fishes, yet they lost none, nor damaged their net. The net of the gospel has enclosed multitudes, yet it is as strong as ever to bring souls to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sea of Tiberias - Called also the Sea of Galilee, being situated in Galilee. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18</a>. In this place Jesus had promised to meet them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-28.htm">Mark 14:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-7.htm">Mark 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>. This interview of Jesus is but just mentioned by Matthew Mat 28:16, and is omitted by both Mark and Luke. This is the reason why John relates so particularly what occurred there. Galilee was a retired place where they would be free from danger, and was therefore a safe and convenient situation for Jesus to meet them, in order to give them his last instructions.<p>On this wise - Thus.

S. John alone uses this name [2]. The return of the disciples from Jerusalem to Galilee is commanded <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-7.htm" title="And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall you see him: see, I have told you.">Matthew 28:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-7.htm" title="But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall you see him, as he said to you.">Mark 16:7</a>.

The opening formula is one often adopted by John (see particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1</a>); considerable periods of time and cycles of ministry are frequently covered by it. Another chapter is opened, another series of events to be recorded which had left undying impression on the apostle's mind, and, in full view of numerous other traditions, was chosen by himself as especially worthy of record. "Jesus manifested himself." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a> we hear that "he manifested his glory;" now he manifested his Person, as an act of his own will. He was "manifested in the flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>), but now that flesh was itself more directly under the control of his personality, and the mere sensuous eye and carnal understanding could not without his special permission realize that wondrous presence. The passive form of the verb is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12, 14</a>. The touch of feeling involved in the active voice must not be overlooked. The "again" clearly points back to the previous manifestations described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14, 19, 26</a>. On each occasion his coming, though in a recognizable human body, was a body (a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, not a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) which had the qualities of spirit. "The disciples" are afterwards mentioned by name. It was to disciples only that he "appeared." Believers in him were those alone who could see this spiritual body. The effect produced upon them was that of objective reality, but this was made to prepared spirits. Such a proceeding is akin to all the grander operations of nature, and the most august manifestations of God. "At the sea of Tiberias." This is the only place where the "sea of Galilee," or of "Gennesareth," is called the "sea of Tiberias." That it was identical with the familiar lake is evident from the known site of Tiberias (now represented by the modern town Tubarieh), a city which is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:02.3; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:09. 1; 'Vit.,' &sect;&sect; 12, 13, 64), and which, from its schools of learned men, had a great place in later Jewish history. Moreover, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-1.htm">John 6:1, 23</a>, if the Greek be accurately rendered, the writer spoke of "the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias," interpreting the name well known by the Jews, through another name by which it would be better recognized by Gentiles (see note on John 6:1). Dr. Farrar, 'Message of the Books,' sees in the nomenclature a hint of the later origin of the Fourth Gospel than the date assigned to the synoptic narrative. 'Er; is used because the shore where they saw him was a raised beach or cliff" above" the sea. It must be observed that the same phrase is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-19.htm">John 6:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a> for Christ's walking "upon the sea;" but the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is itself explained here by the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 4, just as the preposition receives elsewhere more literally another meaning from the context. <span class="cmt_word">And he manifested himself thus</span>; "on this wise," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after the manner to be described. This is the commencement of our Lord's discourses on the kingdom of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>). This was the beginning of the great fulfillment of his own predictions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>), and of the angel's words to the women. The narrative gives the deep heart-tones and genuine teaching of the risen Lord. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Shewed (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>This rendering might easily convey merely the sense of appearing; but its meaning is much deeper. Occurring frequently in the New Testament, it is used most frequently of God and Christ, or of men in their relation to these. Thus, of Christ in person while upon earth (<a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/16-12.htm">Mark 16:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-14.htm">Mark 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>). Of the works of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>). Of Christ in redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>). Of Christ in His second coming (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-28.htm">1 John 2:28</a>). Of Christ in glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>). It is used of God. Of His revelation to men of the knowledge of Himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-19.htm">Romans 1:19</a>). Of His manifestation in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>). Of His righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>). Of His love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9</a>). It is used of men. As epistles manifesting the character and spirit of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>). In the judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). In all these cases the appearing is not merely an appeal to sense, but is addressed to spiritual perception, and contemplates a moral and spiritual effect. It is the setting forth of the law or will or character of God; of the person or work of Christ; of the character or deeds of men, with a view to the disclosure of their quality and to the producing of a moral impression.
