The resurrection of Lazarus is the motive of the triumphal procession. The synoptists, who have omitted the whole episode of Bethany, are naturally silent concerning the impression produced by it on the Passover pilgrims and the Jerusalem crowd. John, more intimately acquainted with the currents of thought in the capital than the rest, drew here from his experience and memory, and has preserved historical features which they had ignored. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Met (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>The verb means to go to meet.
