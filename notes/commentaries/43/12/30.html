Jesus Himself knew that the Father heareth Him always, but this answer is a sign to others. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/11-41.htm" title="Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank you that you have heard me.">John 11:41-42</a>.) He calls it a <span class= "ital">voice</span> in answer to those who said it thundered, or that an angel had spoken. There was that, then, which seemed to them but the thunder’s sound or an angel’s word, which, coming in answer to His prayer and after His teaching. should have been, to ears ready to hear and minds willing to receive, the voice of God witnessing to the mission of His Son.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:27-33 The sin of our souls was the troubled of Christ's soul, when he undertook to redeem and save us, and to make his soul an offering for our sin. Christ was willing to suffer, yet prayed to be saved from suffering. Prayer against trouble may well agree with patience under it, and submission to the will of God in it. Our Lord Jesus undertook to satisfy God's injured honour, and he did it by humbling himself. The voice of the Father from heaven, which had declared him to be his beloved Son, at his baptism, and when he was transfigured, was heard proclaiming that He had both glorified his name, and would glorify it. Christ, reconciling the world to God by the merit of his death, broke the power of death, and cast out Satan as a destroyer. Christ, bringing the world to God by the doctrine of his cross, broke the power of sin, and cast out Satan as a deceiver. The soul that was at a distance from Christ, is brought to love him and trust him. Jesus was now going to heaven, and he would draw men's hearts to him thither. There is power in the death of Christ to draw souls to him. We have heard from the gospel that which exalts free grace, and we have heard also that which enjoins duty; we must from the heart embrace both, and not separate them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Came not because of me - Not to strengthen or confirm me; not that I had any doubts about my course, or any apprehension that God would not approve me and glorify his name.<p>For your sakes - To give you a striking and indubitable proof that I am the Messiah; that you may remember it when I am departed, and be yourselves comforted, supported, and saved. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30.

Of such Gnostic fancies the N. T. knows nothing. The conquest of the devil is necessarily granted along with the <span class="ital">atoning</span> effect of the death of Jesus, and through the operation of the Spirit of the <span class="ital">exalted one</span> it is in process of completion until the Parousia.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[113] As hereafter the devil is the subject which is cast out, so here the <span class="greekheb">κόσμος</span> is the <span class="ital">subject which is judged</span>.

In reference to the declarations of Jesus regarding the devil, it is most markedly apparent with what difficulty Schleiermacher subordinated himself to exegetical tests.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-30.htm" title="Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.">John 12:30</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀπεκρίθη ὁ Ἰησοῦς</span>. Jesus, hearing these conjectures, explained to them that not on His account but on theirs this voice had been uttered. It was of immense importance that the disciples, and the people generally, should understand that the sudden transition from the throne offered by the triumphal acclamation of the previous day to the cross, was not a defeat but a fulfilment of the Divine purpose. The voice furnished them against the coming trial.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="ital">Jesus answered</span>] He answered their discussions about the sound, and by calling it a voice He decides conclusively against those who supposed it to be thunder. But those who recognised that it was a voice were scarcely less seriously mistaken; <span class="ital">their</span> error consisted in not recognising that the voice had a meaning for <span class="ital">them</span>. <span class="bld">Not for My sake hath this voice come</span>, <span class="ital">but for your sakes</span>, i.e. that ye might believe.

It is probable that, at the time of Jesus’ retirements, there were no miracles wrought in secrecy. So also, in the case of bright examples of a happy departure from life, the incidents which occur do not occur for the sake of the departing, but for the sake of the survivors,—<span class="greekheb">δἰ ὑμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">for your sakes</span>) ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-15.htm" title="And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent you may believe; nevertheless let us go to him.">John 11:15</a>, “I am glad for your sakes that I was not there (with Lazarus at Bethany), to the intent ye may believe,” 42, “I knew that Thou nearest me always; but because of the people which stand by, I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me.” [<span class="ital">This was truly a remarkable testimony, not inferior to those which were perceived</span> (heard) <span class="ital">at Jordan and on the holy mount</span> (of transfiguration).—V. g.]<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered</span> to the confused murmur of remark, <span class="cmt_word">and said,</span> <span class="cmt_word">This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes</span>. This surely establishes, on the authority of Jesus, the objective character of the revelation. "It was necessary that you should hear and know and feel who and what I am." Ever thinking of others, living in them, he thinks of their spiritual advantage now. Thoma says that whereas the whole scene corresponds with the synoptic account of Gethsemane, it is idealized on the basis of the Johannine idea of the Divine Lamb and the Logos in flesh, and that Jesus here shows that he needed no strengthening, as the objective revelation was entirely for the sake of others, and not for his own consolation. This ingenious criticism of Thoma rests on the unjustifiable hypothesis that the scene before us did <span class="accented">not</span> precede the agony of the garden, but was a bare invention of the evangelist, because the latter ruled that Gethsemane needed "idealization." Why should not the two scenes be equally true, revealing the fundamental identity of character and personality, the one, moreover, preparing for the other?
