They are spoken to the Apostles, but the narrative is too compressed for us to know whether any answer was given to the Greeks apart from this.

But the immediate connection implies that He regards the extension of his Messianic work, and the acceptance of His truth by the nations of the earth, as part of the glory of the Son of man.

Our Lord might, perhaps, enlarge on some of these hints; and if his hearers took a due notice of them, and made a proper report on their return home, it might prepare the way for the apostles, when they came, by their preaching, more fully to unfold and illustrate these important doctrines. <span class="ital">The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified </span>— Meaning, that he should soon be honoured by the conversion of many of the Gentiles. At the same time he told them, that he was to suffer death before he arrived at this glory; and illustrated the necessity of his dying, by the similitude of grain cast into the earth. <span class="ital">Verily, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, </span>&c. — As if he had said, As the only way to make grain produce fruit is to bury it in the ground; so, the most proper method of bringing about the conversion and salvation of the world is, that I die and be buried. To omit other things, our Lord’s resurrection, the grand miracle on which the truth of Christianity is founded, and by which the conversion of the world was effected, happened in consequence of his death. The late resurrection of Lazarus gave our Lord a natural occasion of speaking on the subject. “And agreeable to his infinite knowledge, he singles out from among so many thousands of seeds almost the only one that dies in the earth, and which, therefore, was an exceeding proper similitude, peculiarly adapted to the purpose for which he uses it. The like is not to be found in any other grain, except <span class="ital">millet, </span>and the large <span class="ital">bean.” </span>— Wesley. <span class="ital">He that loveth his life </span>— More than the will of God; <span class="ital">shall lose it </span>eternally. He further told them, that as he, their Master, was to suffer before his exaltation, so were all they, his disciples; for which reason they were to expect persecution, firmly resolving to lose even life itself, after his example, when called to do it; and in that case he promised them a share in his crown and glory: saying, <span class="ital">He that hateth his life </span>— In comparison of the will of God, and therefore exposes it to great dangers in the cause of the gospel; <span class="ital">shall keep it unto life eternal </span>— And secure a state of immortal glory and happiness. <span class="ital">If any man serve me </span>— If any one would become a faithful servant of mine, would do my will, (for his servants we are whom we obey, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-16.htm" title="Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?">Romans 6:16</a>,) and would serve the cause in which I am engaged; <span class="ital">let him follow me </span>— Let him attach himself to me as one of my disciples, even although his doing so should expose him to the loss of his life; and let him drink into my Spirit, and imitate my example. <span class="ital">And where I am </span>— Where I shall shortly take up mine abode, even in the eternal kingdom of my Father; <span class="ital">there shall also my servant be </span>— In the same felicity and glory.

Perhaps, in speaking thus, Jesus intended tacitly to intimate, that the strangers who wished to be introduced to him, would be greatly disappointed, if their desire of conversing with him proceeded from a hope of recommending themselves to earthly preferments through his favour.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:20-26 In attendance upon holy ordinances, particularly the gospel passover, the great desire of our souls should be to see Jesus; to see him as ours, to keep up communion with him, and derive grace from him. The calling of the Gentiles magnified the Redeemer. A corn of wheat yields no increase unless it is cast into the ground. Thus Christ might have possessed his heavenly glory alone, without becoming man. Or, after he had taken man's nature, he might have entered heaven alone, by his own perfect righteousness, without suffering or death; but then no sinner of the human race could have been saved. The salvation of souls hitherto, and henceforward to the end of time, is owing to the dying of this Corn of wheat. Let us search whether Christ be in us the hope of glory; let us beg him to make us indifferent to the trifling concerns of this life, that we may serve the Lord Jesus with a willing mind, and follow his holy example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The hour is come - The time is come. The word "hour" commonly means a definite part or a division of a day; but it also is used to denote a brief period, and a fixed, definite, determined time. It is used in this sense here.

It is His death He thus sublimely and delicately alluded to. Lost in the scenes of triumph which this desire of the Greeks to see Him called up before His view, He gives no direct answer to their petition for an interview, but sees the cross which was to bring them gilded with glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Christ replies, that the time was now come when he (who was the Son of God) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">should be glorified; </span> that is, by the Gentiles receiving of the gospel, according to the many prophecies of it in the Old Testament; but he goeth on telling them that he must first die. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jesus answered them,....

The proposal of the Gentiles which had been brought to Him, awakens in Jesus, with peculiar force and depth, the thought of His approaching <span class="ital">death</span>; for through His <span class="ital">death</span> was His salvation in truth to be conveyed to the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd....">John 10:16-17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Accordingly, that wish of the Gentiles must appear to Him as already a beginning of that which was to be effected by His death.

This answer is consequently neither <span class="ital">inappropriate</span> (De Wette), nor does it contain an indirect <span class="ital">refusal</span> of the request of the Greeks (Ewald, Hengstenberg, Godet); nor is the <span class="ital">granting</span> of it to be thought of as having taken place before, and as having <span class="ital">been passed over in silence</span> by John (Tholuck, B.

Many commentators (Ewald, Godet, Hengstenberg) think that Jesus did not address the following words to the Greeks, that until he had gone through the agony of death, and entered in human nature on his Divine and mediatorial reign, the mission to the Gentiles could not commence. Tholuck supposed that the interview was over, and that the solemn words are addressed to the disciples in the presence both of Greeks and of others <span class="accented">afterwards</span>; but there is no such break suggested. It is more probable (with Luthardt, Edersheim, Lunge) that the Greeks were close behind Andrew and Philip, and that our Lord at once, for <span class="accented">their</span> advantage, as well as for that of the disciples, proceeded to explain the solemn impression made upon himself by this remarkable desire. Surely it is unnecessary to say that our Lord was anxious not to give umbrage to the priests, or to rouse the animosity of the people. Every word of the terrible address of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>, all the controversies in the temple, even the triumphal entry itself, would and did give mortal umbrage to the priestly party and to the Sanhedrim He had boldly challenged their entire position, he had smitten down their prejudices and assailed their notions of exclusive privilege, and therefore would not have shrunk, on that ground, from intercourse with devout Greeks worshipping at the feast. The words are surely said <span class="accented">to</span> them and <span class="accented">about</span> them, but in the main for the instruction of the disciples themselves. <span class="cmt_word">The hour is come</span> for which he had been waiting (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a>)-the mysterious "hour" on which his glory would depend, and the destiny of the world turn. God not only contemplates great periods, eons of time, but "acceptable years," "days of the Lord," "moments of time," as parts of the eternal plan. That the Son of man should be glorified. The "Son of man," rather than "Son of God," is the term he uses in reference to, and in the presence of, the Greeks. The highest Man is now about to assume his supreme glory, to go forth, as the mighty Man, to rule the world of men. The Son of man is about to ascend into his eternal throne, to clothe himself with all authority of judgment and mercy in heaven and earth. The glorification of the Son of man is one of the high main themes of the Gospel, and its justification is to be found in the fact that the Son of man is indeed the Logos made flesh, and the Lamb slain, and like the Serpent is being lifted up, and as the true Shepherd is laying down his life that he might take it again. The advent of the Greeks opens prophetic vistas which involve tremendous experiences of his own, and also great principles of service for all his followers. His Passion was so inextricably interwoven with his glory, that the former becomes verily the prelude of his victory and supreme exaltation. His death is but his glory. Moreover, the approach of the Gentiles suggested the universal belief in him which would follow upon his Passion and resurrection, and he" foretells that the hour of his glorification was already come" (Augustine).
