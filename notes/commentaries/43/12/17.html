(Comp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-37.htm" title="And when he was come near, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen;">Luke 19:37</a>.) This interpretation makes the Jews of Jerusalem themselves the witnesses whose testimony leads the multitude to receive our Lord as the Christ.<p>If we take the alternative, but less probable text, the multitude in both verses will be one and the same.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-17.htm" title="The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore record....">John 12:17-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">The people, therefore </span>— “Because the forwardness which the multitude now showed to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah was altogether extraordinary, the evangelist assigns the cause thereof. The witnesses of the resurrection of Lazarus had published the miracle far and near. As they were many in number, and persons of reputation, their report gained general credit; and this drew out a great multitude of people to meet Jesus. In saying, <span class="ital">he called Lazarus out of the grave, </span>the evangelist admirably expresses, as well the greatness of the miracle, as the facility with which it was wrought. The easiness of the Scripture style, on the most grand occurrences, is more sublime than all the pomp of orators. <span class="ital">For this cause the people also met him </span>— Because they heard from those who had been eye-witnesses thereof, that he had performed that extraordinary miracle; therefore they went out to meet him, and the multitude coming with him; so that, in a little time, both joined together, partly to go before and partly to follow after. <span class="ital">The Pharisees therefore said, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? </span>— In the mean time, the Pharisees and the great men were exceedingly enraged because every measure they had taken to hinder the people from following Jesus had proved ineffectual.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:12-19 Christ's riding in triumph to Jerusalem is recorded by all the evangelists.

These three verses let us know the external cause of the people’s coming to see Christ, which was the fame of the miracle wrought by our Saviour on Lazarus; this increased the number of those who came to see his entrance into Jerusalem; but the unseen cause was, doubtless, the influence of God upon their hearts, directing them to it, for the further glorifying of his Son before his passion. But this enraged the Pharisees, to see that their decree that those who owned Christ should be turned out of the synagogue should have no better effect: but the multitude rather more owned him, and ran after him.

Against the assumption of an <span class="ital">entry on two occasions</span> (Paulus, Schleiermacher, <span class="ital">üb. d. Schriften des Luk</span>. p. 243 ff., and <span class="ital">L. J</span>. p. 407 ff.), according to which He is said first to have made an entry from Jericho, and, one or two days later, again from Bethany, the very nature of the transaction is decisive, to which a repetition, and one moreover so early, was not appropriate, without degenerating into an organized procession. Only in the view of its occurring once, and of its being brought about accidentally, as it were, by the circumstances, does it retain a moral agreement with the mind of Jesus. With this view, too, all four accounts conform, and they all show not merely by their silence respecting a second procession, but also by the manner in which they represent the one, that they are entirely ignorant of any repetition. Such a repetition, especially one so uniform in character, would be as improbable in itself, as it must be opposed to the course of development of the history of Jesus, which here especially, when the last bloody crisis is prepared for by the entry of the Messianic King, must preserve its divine <span class="ital">decorum</span>, and finds its just measure in the simple fulfilment of the prophetic prediction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-17.htm" title="The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore record.">John 12:17</a>.

The demonstration is thus rendered intelligible. In the Synoptists it is not accounted for. He is represented as entering the city with the pilgrims, and no reason is assigned for the sudden outburst of feeling.
