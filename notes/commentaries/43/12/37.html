St. John’s narrative implies, therefore, that the “signs” of the earlier Gospels were well known. He has himself recorded but six miracles, and all these, with the exception of the feeding the five thousand, belong to the Judæan ministry. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Yet</span> <span class= "bld">they believed not on him.</span>—This is the writer’s comment on the general result of Christ’s work at the close of His public teaching. This too is said of the multitude, the people as a whole. There were, of course, not a few who were then walking according as they had light, but it was not so with the many. Rejection and not acceptance was the result of Christ’s personal work on earth; yet rejection accompanied, as on this day, by signs which pointed to a world-wide acceptance. “He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-11.htm" title="He came to his own, and his own received him not.">John 1:11-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-37.htm" title="But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:...">John 12:37-41</a></span>. <span class="ital">Though he had done so many miracles before them </span>— So that they could not but see them; <span class="ital">yet they believed not on him </span>— That is, in general they did not; being hardened in their infidelity. <span class="ital">That the saying of Esaias might </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">So that the saying of Esaias was, fulfilled, </span>as Dr. Doddridge renders the clause, observing, “It is apparent that the accomplishment of this prophecy could not be the end they proposed to themselves in their unbelief; and consequently that the expression, <span class="greekheb">ινα πληρωθη</span>, must be rendered as above.” Thus also Dr. Macknight, who observes, that <span class="greekheb">ινα </span>here, as well as in many other passages, ought to be translated <span class="ital">so that, </span>as denoting the event spoken of, and not the cause of that event. <span class="ital">Which he spake </span>— In the name of Christ and his servants, referring expressly to gospel times; <span class="ital">Lord, who hath believed our report?</span> — The tidings we bring, the testimony which we bear, especially concerning the great and wonderful humiliation and exaltation of the Messiah, predicted by that prophet in the passage referred to, namely, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm" title="Who has believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?">Isaiah 53:1</a>, &c., where see the notes. <span class="ital">And to whom hath the arm of the</span> <span class="ital">Lord been revealed? </span>— To whom has his power been manifested, so as to conquer those strong prejudices which men have entertained against the appointed method of salvation, or to save whom has it been exerted? Observe, reader, the power of God is only exerted to save those who believe the gospel report. <span class="ital">Therefore, they could not believe </span>— They were now in a manner utterly incapable of believing, because, by the just judgment of God for their obstinacy and wilful resistance of the truth, they were, at length, so left to the hardness of their hearts, that neither the miracles nor the doctrines of our Lord could make any impression upon them. <span class="ital">Because Esaias said again, He hath blinded their eyes, </span>&c. — As God is said to <span class="ital">harden the heart of Pharaoh </span>in one place, while in another it is said, <span class="ital">Pharaoh hardened his own heart; </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm" title="But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-32.htm" title="And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.">Exodus 8:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-12.htm" title="And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had spoken to Moses.">Exodus 9:12</a>;) and as we ought to be very tender of ascribing to God any thing that looks like a necessitating influence to impel men to sin, “I apprehend,” says Dr. Doddridge, “that all we are here to understand, by God’s blinding and hardening these Jews, is, that he permitted them to grow more and more prejudiced against the gospel,” namely, by withdrawing from them his abused grace. <span class="ital">Now these things said Esaias when he saw his glory </span>— Namely, Christ’s glory. See notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1</a>, &c., where the glory which Isaiah saw is expressly said to be the glory of Jehovah, the supreme God. The meaning is, that Esaias uttered these remarkable words, when, in a vision, he saw the glory of the Son of God, and the manifestations which he was to make of the divine counsels, and described the effect which those manifestations would have upon his hearers, for which reason they are a prophetical description of the men of the age in which Jesus lived.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:37-43 Observe the method of conversion implied here. Sinners are brought to see the reality of Divine things, and to have some knowledge of them. To be converted, and truly turned from sin to Christ, as their Happiness and Portion. God will heal them, will justify and sanctify them; will pardon their sins, which are as bleeding wounds, and mortify their corruptions, which are as lurking diseases. See the power of the world in smothering convictions, from regard to the applause or censure of men. Love of the praise of men, as a by-end in that which is good, will make a man a hypocrite when religion is in fashion, and credit is to be got by it; and love of the praise of men, as a base principle in that which is evil, will make a man an apostate, when religion is in disgrace, and credit is to be lost for it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So many miracles - This does not refer to any miracles performed on this occasion, but to all his miracles performed in view of the nation, in healing the sick, opening the eyes of the blind, raising the dead, etc. John here gives the summary or the result of all his work undeniable proof of his being the Messiah, yet the nation did not believe on him.<p>Before them - Before the Jewish nation.

Openly, and in the presence of them; meaning those miracles which were done at Jerusalem, as those which brought Nicodemus to him, and to an acknowledgment of him as a teacher sent from God; and particularly the cure of the lame man at Bethesda's pool, the giving sight to the man that was born blind, by anointing his eyes with clay, and sending him to wash in the Pool of Siloam, and the raising Lazarus from the dead at Bethany, which was within two miles of Jerusalem, in the presence of many of them who were come there to comfort Martha and Mary. Yet <p>they believed not on him; the miracles done by Christ before their eyes, which they could not deny, nor disprove, and were so many, and so great, were aggravations of their unbelief; and such indeed is the nature of that sin, and so deeply rooted is it, that the most powerful means, and mighty works, will not bring a person to believe in Christ, without the powerful and efficacious grace of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</span><p>(9) Faith is not of nature, but of grace.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-37.htm" title="But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:">John 12:37</a>.
