In adding ‘thy’ to ‘king’ and in writing ‘an ass’s colt’ the Evangelist seems to be translating direct from the Hebrew. The best editions of the LXX. omit ‘thy’ and all have ‘a young colt’ for the words here rendered ‘an ass’s colt.’ Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm" title="It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.

This oracle is admitted by commentators of opposite schools to refer to the Messiah. There was no need, in order to fulfill the spirit of the whole passage, that the King should come to his own <span class="accented">literally</span> upon the back of a beast of burden. The prophecy does, however, suggest the modesty, the absence of all pomp or display of worldly wealth and power; nay, the humiliation on the part of the true King. Both Matthew and John omit the characteristics of "righteous and saved," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "delivered" from the hands of his cruel enemies. The suffering Servant of God of the great oracle of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. was in the mind of the Prophet Zechariah, and he adds this feature to the triumphant coming of the true Prince of Peace, that he would "cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from <span class="accented">Jerusalem</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so act that even the national pride and power and military prowess should come to an end; "Speak peace to the nations; rule from sea to sea, from the river to the ends of the earth." As John and Matthew both see the symbolical fulfillment of the prophecy, they doubtless would have us bear in mind the whole passage. John transforms the "Rejoice greatly, shout," etc., of the prophet into "<span class="accented">Fear not</span>." He seems to take it at one stage only of fulfillment, when anxiety might momentarily be put to rest. The "<span class="accented">Fear</span> not" is a lower form of "great rejoicing." It is something for men to dismiss their doubts and hush their unrest, even when they cannot burst into song. Hengstenberg and Godet urge that the "meekness and lowliness" to which the prophet referred, and which Matthew cited from him, was imaged in the lowly beast on which never man sat. But it must not be forgotten that the ass was used by distinguished personages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-9.htm">Judges 5:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-26.htm">2 Samuel 19:26</a>). And all that was really meant by it was the choice of a creature associated rather with daily life than with military display. Meyer and Moulton urge that it was a chosen symbol of peace (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> substituted for the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> of the LXX. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>). Contrary to Keim's animadversion, our Lord and his disciples adopted here the idea of a Jewish Messiah, stripping it of its worldly characteristics. It should be observed that, while John's narrative is in harmony with the synoptists, he greatly abbreviates it. </body></html>
