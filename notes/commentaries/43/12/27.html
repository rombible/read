It is the seat of the natural feelings and emotions, and, as the fatal hour approaches, our Lord is in that region of His human life troubled. There is a real shrinking from the darkness of the death which is at hand. The conflict exists but for a moment, but in all its fearfulness is real, and then the cup of the world’s woe is seized and drunk to its bitter dregs. Men have sometimes wondered that St. John passes over the agony of the garden of Gethsemane, but the agony of Gethsemane is here, and the very words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39</a> are echoed. Men have wondered, too, that in the life of the Son of man a struggle such as this could have had even a moment’s place. Not a few, indeed, would at any cost read the words otherwise. But they <span class= "ital">cannot</span> be read otherwise, either on the written page or in the hearts of men. That troubled soul asked, “What shall I say?” Blessed reality! In that struggle humanity struggled, and in that victory humanity won.<p><span class= "bld">Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</span>—It is uncertain whether the first words of this sentence are a prayer, or whether they should be read as a question. In the latter case the meaning would be, “What shall I say? Shall I say, Father save Me from this hour? But no: for this cause came I unto this hour. I cannot shrink back or seek to be delivered from it.” As a prayer the meaning would be—“Father, save Me from this hour; but for this cause, that I may be saved from it, came I unto this hour. The moment of agony is the moment of victory.”<p>The real difficulty of the verse lies in the words <span class= "ital">“</span>for this cause,” for which a meaning must be sought in the context. No interpretation of them is free from objection, but that which seems to have, upon the whole most probability, understands them as referring to the words which follow, and reads the clause, “Father, glorify Thy name,” as part of this verse. The sense of the whole passage would therefore be, “Father, save Me from this hour; but Thy will, not Mine, be done; for this cause came I unto this hour, that Thy name be glorified; Father, glorify Thy name.” (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/12-49.htm" title="I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?">Luke 12:49-50</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.">John 12:27</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now is my soul troubled </span>— Our Lord, having uttered what is above recorded, seems to have paused for a while, and entered on a deep contemplation of the very different scene which lay before him; the prospect of which moved him to such a degree, that he uttered his grief in these and the following doleful words. For he had various foretastes of his passion before he fully entered into it. <span class="ital">And what shall I say? </span>— Not, What shall I choose? for his heart was fixed in choosing the will of his Father: but, What shall I say in prayer to my heavenly Father? What petition shall I offer to him on this occasion? <span class="ital">Father, save me from this hour </span>— Dr. Campbell reads, <span class="ital">What shall I say? </span>[<span class="ital">shall I say,</span>] <span class="ital">Father, save me from this hour? But I came on purpose for this hour; </span>considering the words as containing two questions: the distress of Christ’s soul first suggesting a petition for deliverance, in which, however, he is instantly checked by the reflection on the end and design of his coming. The passage is understood by Dr. Doddridge in the same sense, who says, “I suppose few need be told, that the pointing of the New Testament is far less ancient than the text. It is agreeable to observe, how many difficulties may be removed by varying it, and departing from the common punctuation: of which I take this to be one of the most remarkable instances. For as the text does not oblige us to it, it does not seem natural to suppose that our Lord actually offered this petition, and then immediately retracted it.” <span class="ital">But for this cause came I unto this hour </span>— For this cause was I born into the world, and came even to this present hour, that I might bear the sufferings on which I am entering, and might redeem my people by them; and far be it from me to draw back from such engagements and undertakings. By praying on this occasion, our Lord shows us what is the best method of obtaining support and comfort in deep distress. At the same time, as in his prayer he expressed an entire resignation to the will of his Father, he has taught us, that although the weakness of human nature may shrink at the first thoughts of suffering, his disciples ought not to yield, but to fortify themselves by just reflections on, and a firm faith in, the wisdom, power, and goodness of God, and the happy end he proposes to be answered by their afflictions. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:27-33 The sin of our souls was the troubled of Christ's soul, when he undertook to redeem and save us, and to make his soul an offering for our sin. Christ was willing to suffer, yet prayed to be saved from suffering. Prayer against trouble may well agree with patience under it, and submission to the will of God in it. Our Lord Jesus undertook to satisfy God's injured honour, and he did it by humbling himself. The voice of the Father from heaven, which had declared him to be his beloved Son, at his baptism, and when he was transfigured, was heard proclaiming that He had both glorified his name, and would glorify it. Christ, reconciling the world to God by the merit of his death, broke the power of death, and cast out Satan as a destroyer. Christ, bringing the world to God by the doctrine of his cross, broke the power of sin, and cast out Satan as a deceiver. The soul that was at a distance from Christ, is brought to love him and trust him. Jesus was now going to heaven, and he would draw men's hearts to him thither. There is power in the death of Christ to draw souls to him. We have heard from the gospel that which exalts free grace, and we have heard also that which enjoins duty; we must from the heart embrace both, and not separate them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now is my soul troubled - The mention of his death brought before him its approaching horrors, its pains, its darkness, its unparalleled woes. Jesus was full of acute sensibility, and his human nature shrunk from the scenes through which he was to pass. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-41.htm">Luke 23:41-44</a>.<p>What shall I say? - This is an expression denoting intense anxiety and perplexity. As if it were a subject of debate whether he could bear those sufferings; or whether the work of man's redemption should be abandoned, and he should call upon God to save him. Blessed be his name that he was willing to endure these sorrows, and did not forsake man when he was so near being redeemed! On the decision of that moment - the fixed and unwavering purpose of the Son of God depended man's salvation. If Jesus had forsaken his purpose then, all would have been lost.<p>Father, save me - This ought undoubtedly to have been read as a question - "Shall I say, Father, save me?" Shall I apply to God to rescue me? or shall I go forward to bear these trials? As it is in our translation, it represents him as actually offering the prayer, and then checking himself. The Greek will bear either interpretation. The whole verse is full of deep feeling and anxiety. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-50.htm">Luke 12:50</a>.<p>This hour - These calamities. The word "hour," here, doubtless has reference to his approaching sufferings the appointed hour for him to suffer. Shall I ask my Father to save me from this hour - that is, from these approaching sufferings? That it might have been done, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>.<p>But for this cause - That is, to suffer and die. As this was the design of his coming as he did it deliberately - -as the salvation of the world depended on it, he felt that it would not be proper to pray to be delivered from it. He came to suffer, and he submitted to it. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-42.htm">Luke 23:42</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27, 28. Now is my soul troubled&#8212;He means at the prospect of His death, just alluded to. Strange view of the Cross this, immediately after representing it as the hour of His glory! (Joh 12:23). But the two views naturally meet, and blend into one. It was the Greeks, one might say, that troubled Him. Ah! they shall see Jesus, but to Him it shall be a costly sight.<p>and what shall I say?&#8212;He is in a strait betwixt two. The death of the cross was, and could not but be, appalling to His spirit. But to shrink from absolute subjection to the Father, was worse still. In asking Himself, "What shall I say?" He seems as if thinking aloud, feeling His way between two dread alternatives, looking both of them sternly in the face, measuring, weighing them, in order that the choice actually made might be seen, and even by himself the more vividly felt, to be a profound, deliberate, spontaneous election.<p>Father, save me from this hour&#8212;To take this as a question&#8212;"Shall I say, Father, save me," &c.&#8212;as some eminent editors and interpreters do, is unnatural and jejune. It is a real petition, like that in Gethsemane, "Let this cup pass from Me"; only whereas there He prefaces the prayer with an "If it be possible," here He follows it up with what is tantamount to that&#8212;"Nevertheless for this cause came I unto this hour." The sentiment conveyed, then, by the prayer, in both cases, is twofold: (1) that only one thing could reconcile Him to the death of the cross&#8212;its being His Father's will He should endure it&#8212;and (2) that in this view of it He yielded Himself freely to it. What He recoils from is not subjection to His Father's will: but to show how tremendous a self-sacrifice that obedience involved, He first asks the Father to save Him from it, and then signifies how perfectly He knows that He is there for the very purpose of enduring it. Only by letting these mysterious words speak their full meaning do they become intelligible and consistent. As for those who see no bitter elements in the death of Christ&#8212;nothing beyond mere dying&#8212;what can they make of such a scene? and when they place it over against the feelings with which thousands of His adoring followers have welcomed death for His sake, how can they hold Him up to the admiration of men?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Now is my soul troubled; </span> by <span class="ital">soul</span> is not here to be understood only the sensitive part of the soul, but his whole human soul. So <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-21.htm" title="When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.">John 13:21</a></span>, <span class="ital">He was troubled in spirit.</span> Our inward troubles arise from our passions; and there are passions of grief and fear, which give us most of our inward trouble; fear respecteth some evil at a distance from us; grief is caused by evil fallen upon us, or so near that we seem to be already in the power of it. The word here used is tetaraktai, which signifieth no mean, but a great and more than ordinary, degree of trouble. Christ was greatly troubled, though not so as we sometimes are, when our trouble leadeth us to despair: Christ was capable of no sinful trouble. Hence two questions arise: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. For what the soul of Christ was troubled? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. How such a degree of trouble could agree to the Lord Jesus Christ? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He tells us, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-38.htm" title="Then said he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death: tarry you here, and watch with me.">Matthew 26:38</a></span>, that he was <span class="ital">exceedingly sorrowful, </span> so as sorrow was one part of his trouble; and we may learn from what he afterward saith in this verse, <span class="ital">Father, save me from this hour, </span> that fear made up the other part of it. He was grieved, and he was afraid; some say it was at the apprehension of that miserable death he was to die; others say, at the sense of the Divine wrath which he was to undergo, death being not yet overcome, and his conflict with his Father’s wrath for the sins of men being yet to be endured. Though Christ at this time was in the most perfect obedience to his Father’s will, offering up a most acceptable and well pleasing sacrifice unto God; yet he, sustaining our persons, had a conflict to endure even with his Father’s wrath upon that account, though not upon his own personal account; for so he was at this time doing that which was most acceptable and well pleasing in his sight. As to the second question, nothing could more agree to Christ than this, both with respect to his human nature, which had the same natural (though not sinful) infirmities which other men have; and with respect to his design and end, to help and relieve his people under their troubles of spirit; and, as the apostle saith, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-15.htm" title="And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.">Hebrews 2:15</a></span>, <span class="ital">to deliver them who through fear of death are all their lifetime subject to bondage.</span> So as this trouble of spirit agreed to him both as man and as Mediator. But there must be a vast difference observed between this trouble of spirit in Christ, and that which is in us. Our troubles are upon reflections for our own sin, and the wrath of God due to us therefore; his trouble was for the wrath of God due to us for our sins. Our troubles are because we have personally grieved God; his was because those given to him (not he himself) had offended God. We are afraid of our eternal condemnation; he was only afraid by a natural fear of death, which naturally riseth higher according to the kind of death we die. Our troubles have mixtures of despair, distrust, sinful horrors; there was no such thing in his trouble. Our troubles in their natural tendencies are killing and destroying; only by accident, and the wise ordering of Divine providence, prove advantageous, by leading us to him, as the only remedy for troubled souls: his trouble was, in the very nature of it, not only pure and clean, but also sanative and healing. But that he was truly troubled, and that in his whole soul, and that such a trouble did very well agree, as to the human nature he had assumed, so to his office as our Mediator and Saviour, and the foundation of a great deal of peace, quiet, and satisfaction to us, is out of question. The chastisement of our peace in this particular lay upon him; and they were some of those stripes of his, by which we are healed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And</span> (saith he) <span class="bld">what shall I say?</span> It is the natural language of a spirit troubled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Father, save me from this hour; </span> this hour of my passion; it is the same with that in our Saviour’s last prayer, <span class="ital">Let this cup pass from me; </span> and must be understood with the same qualifications there expressed, <span class="ital">if it be thy will, if it be possible, &c.</span> By his blessed example he hath taught us, under the distresses of our spirits, whither to flee, what to do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">For my love</span> (saith David to his enemies, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-4.htm" title="For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself to prayer.">Psalm 109:4</a></span>) <span class="ital">they are mine adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer; </span> I give up myself to prayer.

But how doth our Saviour pray to be saved from that hour, when for this cause he came into the world? Here was in Christ a conflict between the flesh and the Spirit; not like ours, which is between corrupt flesh and the Spirit, but between his natural flesh, and the natural affections of it, and his spirit; that was fully conformed to the will of God, and gets a present conquest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">But for this cause</span> (saith he) <span class="ital">came I to this hour:</span> he checks himself, correcteth the language of his natural flesh, acquiesceth, rejoiceth in the will of God.

At the hardness and unbelief of the Jews, and the rejection of them, when the Gentiles would be called, and converted, by which he would be glorified: and at the conduct and carriage of his disciples to him, he had a foreknowledge of; at the betraying of him by one, and the denial of him by another, and the flight of them all from him; and at the devil, and the furious and violent attack he knew he would make upon him, though he had obliged him to leave him, when he assaulted him before, and knew he could find nothing in him now, and that as God, he was able to destroy him; but this was to be done by him, as man, and by lying too: he was in his human soul troubled at the thoughts of his death, though it was his Father's will, and he had agreed to it, and was for the salvation of his people, his heart was so much set upon; yet it was terrible to the human nature, and especially as attended with the wrath of God; at the apprehensions of which, his soul was exceedingly troubled; not as about to fall on him on his own personal account, but as being the surety of his people, and as having their sins upon him to satisfy angry and injured justice for: <p>and what shall I say? this question he puts, as being in the utmost distress, and difficulty, as if he knew not what to say; and yet not as advising with his disciples, what was to be said or done in his case; but is rather used to introduce another question, as the following words may be formed: shall I say, <p>father, save me from this hour? as requesting his Father, that he might be strengthened under his sufferings and death, and carried through them, and out of them; or rather as deprecating them, desiring the cup might pass from him, as he afterwards did; and then the sense is, shall I put up such a petition to my Father, to save me from sorrows, sufferings, and death? no, I will not: the human nature through frailty might prompt him to it, and he be just going to do it, when he corrects himself, saying; <p>but for this cause came I unto this hour: this hour or time of sorrow and suffering was appointed for him; it was fixed in the covenant of grace, and Christ had agreed to it; he was sent into this world, and he came into it, on account of this hour; and was preserved hitherto for this purpose; and was now come to Jerusalem, and was there at this instant, for that very reason, namely, to suffer and die.

To define this specially as the feeling <span class="ital">of the divine anger</span> (Beza, Calvin, Calovius, Hengstenberg, and many others), which He has certainly appeased by His death, rests on the supposition, which is nowhere justified, that, according to the object of the death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm" title="The next day John sees Jesus coming to him, and said, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world.">John 1:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm" title="And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:">John 3:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-11.htm" title="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep....">John 10:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>, <span class="ital">et al.</span>), <span class="ital">its severity</span> also is measured in the consciousness.

T. view conceived of as the voice of the Lord, as in Psalms 29, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-4.htm" title="After it a voice roars: he thunders with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.">Job 37:4</a>, and frequently), in which only the <span class="ital">subjective disposition</span>, the so-attuned <span class="ital">inner ear</span> of Jesus (and of the disciples), distinguished the words <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐδόξασα</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; while others, less susceptible to this divine symbolism of nature, believed only in a general way, that in the thunder an angel had spoken with Jesus; while others again, unsusceptible, understood the natural occurrence simply and solely as such, and took it for nothing further than what it objectively was. So substantially, not merely Paulus, Kuinoel, Lücke, Ammon, De Wette, Maier, Baeumlein, and several others, but also Hengstenberg.[111] Several have here had recourse to the later Jewish view of <span class="ital">Bath-Kol</span> (by which, however, only real literal voices, not natural phenomena, without speech, were understood; see Lübkert in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1835, 3), as well as to the Gentile interpretations of thunder as the voice of the gods (see Wetstein). Against this entire view, it is decisive that John himself, the ear-witness, describes a <span class="greekheb">φωνὴ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</span>, which was an objective occurrence; that he further repeats its express words; that, further, to take the first half of these words referring to the past, as the product of a merely subjective perception, is without any support in the prayer of Jesus; that, further, Jesus Himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-30.htm" title="Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.">John 12:30</a>, gives His confirmation to the occurrence of an actual voice; that, finally, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΛΛΟΙ</span></span></span> also, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-29.htm" title="The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.">John 12:29</a>, must have heard a <span class="ital">speech</span>. Hence we must abide by the interpretation that a <span class="ital">voice actually issued from heaven</span>, which John relates, and Jesus confirms as an objective occurrence. It is a voice which came miraculously from God (as was the case, according to the Synoptics, at the baptism and the transfiguration), yet as regards its intelligibility conditioned by the subjective disposition and receptivity of the hearers (so also Tholuck, Olshausen, Kling, Luthardt, Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. I. p. 391 f., Lange, Ebrard, Godet following the old commentators), which sounded with a <span class="ital">tone as of thunder</span>, so that the definite words which resounded in this form of sound remained unintelligible to the unsusceptible, who simply heard that majestic kind of sound, but not its contents, and said: <span class="greekheb">βροντὴν γεγονέναι</span>; whereas, on the other hand, others, more susceptible, certainly understood this much, that the thunder-like voice was a <span class="ital">speech</span>, but not what it said, and thought an angel (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-9.htm" title="And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.">Acts 23:9</a>) had spoken in this thunder-voice to Jesus. This opinion of theirs, however, does not justify us in regarding the divine word which was spoken as also actually communicated by angelic ministry (Hofmann), since, in fact, the utterance of the <span class="greekheb">ἄλλοι</span> is not adduced as at all the true account, and since, moreover, the heavenly voice, according to the text, appears simply and solely as the <span class="ital">answer of the Father</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[109] Which in itself is not only not immoral, but the absence of which would even lower the moral greatness and the worth of His sacrifice.

He, however, refers the <span class="greekheb">δοξάσω</span> to the fact that the Son, even in His sufferings, will allow the will of God entirely to prevail with Him. The glorifying of God, however, by means of the death of Jesus, which was certainly the culminating point of His obedience to the Father, reaches further, namely (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-1.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you:...">John 17:1-2</a>) to God’s honour through the Lord’s attainment of exaltation throughout the whole world by means of His death. As <span class="greekheb">ἐδόξασα</span> refers to His munus <span class="ital">propheticum</span>, so <span class="greekheb">δοξάσω</span> to the fact that He attains to the munus <span class="ital">regium</span> through the fulfilment of the munus <span class="ital">sacerdotale</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.">John 12:27</a>. The distinct and near prospect of the cross as the path to glory which these Greeks called up in His thoughts prompts Him to exclaim: <span class="greekheb">Νῦν ἡ ψυχή μου τετάρακται</span>, “Now is my soul troubled”. <span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span> is, as Weiss remarks, synonymous with <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-21.htm" title="When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.">John 13:21</a>. A conflict of emotions disturbs His serenity. “Concurrebat horror mortis et ardor obedientiae.” Bengel. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τί εἴπω</span>; “And what shall I say?” This clause certainly suggests that the next should also be interrogative, “Shall I say, Father, save me from this hour? But for this cause (or, with this object) came I to this hour.” That is, if He should now pray to be delivered from death this would be to stultify all He had up to this time been doing; for without His death His life would be fruitless. He would still be a seed preserved and not sown.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. This is a verse of well-known difficulty, and the meaning cannot be determined with certainty, several meanings being admissible. The doubtful points are (1) the position of the interrogation, whether it should come after ‘I say’ or ‘from this hour;’ (2) the meaning of ‘for this cause.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Now is my soul troubled</span>] The word rendered ‘soul’ is the same as that rendered ‘life’ in ‘loveth his life’ and ‘hateth his life.’ To bring out this and the sequence of thought, ‘life’ would perhaps be better here. ‘He that would serve Me must follow Me and be ready to hate his life; for My life has long since been tossed and torn with emotion and sorrow.’ ‘Is troubled’ = <span class="ital">has been and still is troubled</span>; a frequent meaning of the Greek perfect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">what shall I say?</span>] Or, <span class="ital">what</span> <span class="bld">must</span> <span class="ital">I say?</span> This appears to be the best punctuation; and the question expresses the difficulty of framing a prayer under the conflicting influences of fear of death and willingness to glorify His Father by dying. The result is first a prayer under the influence of fear—‘save Me from this hour’ (comp. ‘Let this cup pass from Me,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm" title="And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.">Matthew 26:39</a>), and then a prayer under the influence of ready obedience—‘Glorify Thy Name’ through My sufferings. But the Greek means ‘save me <span class="ital">out of</span>’ (<span class="ital">sôson ek</span>), i.e. ‘bring Me safe out of;’ rather than ‘save Me <span class="ital">from</span>’ (<span class="ital">sôson apo</span>), i.e. ‘keep Me altogether away from,’ as in ‘deliver us <span class="ital">from</span> the evil’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.">Matthew 6:13</a>). S. John omits the Agony in the garden, which was in the Synoptists and was well known to every Christian; but he gives us here an insight into a less known truth, which is still often forgotten, that the agony was not confined to Gethsemane, but was part of Christ’s whole life. Others place the question at ‘from this hour,’ and the drift of the whole will then be, ‘How can I say, Father save Me from this hour? Nay, I came to suffer; therefore My prayer shall be, Father, glorify Thy Name.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for this cause</span>] These words are taken in two opposite senses; (1) that I might be saved out of this hour; (2) that Thy Name might be glorified by My obedience. Both make good sense. If the latter be adopted it would be better to transpose the stops, placing a full stop after ‘from this hour’ and a colon after ‘unto this hour.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?

The horror of death, and the ardour of His obedience, were meeting together.[320]—<span class="greekheb">καὶ τί εἴπω</span>, <span class="ital">and what shall I say</span>) Jesus immediately sustains [buoys up] His soul in that very <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>, <span class="ital">now</span>. A double-membered speech follows this formula; and the formula itself has this force, that His thought is to be regarded as having conceived the whole idea expressed [sentiment, viz., not only nature’s instinctive shrinking from suffering, but also full approval of God’s will] in one moment, although human language could not comprise the full expression of the whole in one moment; hence, as it were for the sake of <span class="greekheb">προθεραπεία</span> [precaution, lest His following words should be misunderstood, as though He were doubting, should He choose suffering], He saith, <span class="ital">what</span> SHALL I Say? not, <span class="ital">what shall I choose?</span> with which comp.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a> we hear that he troubled himself, and shuddered wrathfully in his "spirit" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) at the contemplation of all the evils and curse of death; now his whole <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his life centered in its corporeal environment as a man, the self which the Son of God had taken up into the Divine essence, was in depth of agony, preluding the strong crying and tears to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a> refers. These perturbations of his soul and spirit can only be accounted for by the uniqueness of his Personality, the capacity for suffering, and the extent to which he was identifying himself with the sinful nature with which he had invested himself. Sin is the sting of death. He had by the nature of his incarnation become sin for us. Martyrs, freed from sin, delivered from its curse and shame and power through him, face it with calmness and hope; but there was infinite space in his breast for all the curse of it to rain its horrible tempest. He felt that the hour of his extremest travail had come upon him. <span class="cmt_word">And what shall I</span> (must I) <span class="cmt_word">say</span>? What is the regal passion of my heart? What is the right revelation for me to make to you? What is the prayer for me to offer to the Father? It remains a great question whether the next utterance is the primary answer of the question itself, or whether it continues the interrogation - whether, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Lord lifts up for a moment the cry of heart-rending grief, <span class="accented">Father, save me from this hour!</span> or whether he said, <span class="accented">Shall I say, Father, save me from this hour?</span> The first view supposes in the first place actual uncertainty and awful bewilderment, and then a most intense cry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) to him who was able to save him from death. Save me either from the death itself, or from the fear and horror which accompanies it (Lucke, Meyer, Hengstenberg, and Moulton). <span class="accented">It</span> need not be a prayer to leave the world unsaved, to sacrifice all the work on which he had come. We are told by the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) that he was "heard" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) and delivered from human weakness which might have rebelled in the intolerable darkness of that hour. <span class="cmt_word">Father, save me from this hour</span>; the equivalent to the prayer, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me," with its grand "nevertheless," etc. If this be its meaning, we have a scene nearly, if not closely, identifiable with the agony of the garden. The correction which immediately follows augments the comparison with the scene in Gethsemane recorded by the synoptists. The R.T. and Revised Version have put their note of interrogation after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> into the margin, and not into the text. Ewald, Lange, Kling, Tholuck, Lachmann, accept this punctuation, and Godet regards it as an hypothetical prayer, although he does not place the interrogation after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The self-interrogation of the previous utterance at least reveals the presence of such a desire, but one which vanishes as the mysterious hour engulfs and wraps him round. If this be the true interpretation, then the clause that follows must be, <span class="cmt_word">Nay</span> this <span class="cmt_word">I</span> cannot say, for on account of this very conflict - <span class="cmt_word">for this cause</span> - only to fight this great battle - <span class="cmt_word">I came</span> steadily forward <span class="cmt_word">to this hour</span>. I cannot pray to escape from it. If, however, we have the expression of an actual though momentary prayer, and if we give it the meaning, "bring me safely through and out of this hour," it corresponds with the Divine trust in the Father's love which, in the extremity of the anguish and desertion, he yet reveals, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span> becomes equivalent to "Pray, this I need not say; the end is known" (Westcott). I know that I shall be delivered, <span class="accented">for this cause, viz</span>. <span class="accented">that</span> I should encounter and pass through the hour I came into the world, and have reached the final crisis. This is, to my mind, more satisfactory; the interrogative prayer gives a sentimental character to the utterance out of harmony with the theme. Godet thinks that the fact that, according to the synoptists, our Lord in the garden <span class="accented">did</span> actually offer the prayer which he <span class="accented">here</span> hesitates to present, is evidence of the historic character of both accounts. I differ from him, because the sublime answer to the prayer here given would seem to preclude the necessity of the final conflict. The circumstance that he <span class="accented">did</span> offer the prayer as interpreted above, a prayer which was veritably heard, is in harmony with the narrative of the agony. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>My soul<p>See reff. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>.

Some commentators connect this with the following clause, shall I say, Father, save me, etc. But this does not agree with the context, and represents a hesitation in the mind of Jesus which found no place there.<p>Save me<p>The shrinking from suffering belongs to the human personality of our Lord (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>); but the prayer, save me from this hour, is not for deliverance from suffering, but for victory in the approaching trial. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>. The expression is very vivid. "Save me out of this hour."<p>For this cause<p>Explained by glorify thy name. For this use, namely, that the Father's name might be glorified. </body></html>
