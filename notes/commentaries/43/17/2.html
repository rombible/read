Eternal life could not be given to believers, unless Christ, their Surety, both glorified the Father, and was glorified of him. This is the sinner's way to eternal life, and when this knowledge shall be made perfect, holiness and happiness will be fully enjoyed. The holiness and happiness of the redeemed, are especially that glory of Christ, and of his Father, which was the joy set before him, for which he endured the cross and despised the shame; this glory was the end of the sorrow of his soul, and in obtaining it he was fully satisfied. Thus we are taught that our glorifying God is needed as an evidence of our interest in Christ, through whom eternal life is God's free gift.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As thou hast given him power - It was on the ground of this power given to Christ that the apostles were commanded to go and teach all nations.

To all on whom the Father has purposed to bestow the blessings of redemption through his Son. God has a plan in all he does, extending to men as well as to other objects. One part of his plan was that the atonement of Christ should not be in vain. Hence he promised him that he should see of the travail of his soul and should be satisfied <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>; and hence the Saviour had the assurance that the Father had given him a portion of the human family, and would apply this great work to them. It is to be observed here that the Saviour in this prayer makes an important distinction between "all flesh" and those who were "given to him." He has power over all. He can control, direct, restrain them. Wicked men are so far under his universal dominion, and so far restrained by his power, that they will not be able to prevent his bestowing redemption on those were given him that is, all who will believe on him. Long ago, if they had been able, they would have banished religion from the world; but they are under the power of Christ, and it is his purpose that there shall be "a seed to serve him," and that "the gates of hell shall not prevail" against his church. Men who oppose the gospel should therefore feel that they cannot prevent the salvation of Christians, and should be alarmed lest they be found "fighting against God." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. given&#8212;gavest<p>him power over all flesh&#8212;(See on [1871]Mt 11:27; [1872]Mt 28:18-20).<p>give eternal life to as many as, &c.&#8212;literally, "to all that which thou hast given him."

The former part of the text speaketh of the more general power and authority, by which the Father had already made Christ glorious; putting all things under his feet, and causing all knees to bow down unto him; which are other phrases by which the same things are expressed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet.

This general power our Saviour executeth according to the counsels of God, with respect to their faith or unbelief. As to those given to Christ, that he should die in their stead, and with the price of his blood purchase eternal life for them; Christ executeth his power in giving them eternal life: under which notion (as appeareth from many other scriptures) is comprehended, not the end only, which is eternal life and happiness, but all the necessary means in order to that end; from whence we are to observe, that eternal life is a free gift, that the Son gives only to such as the Father hath given him by his eternal counsels; so that all shall not be saved; for the term <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">as many as, </span>& c., is plainly restrictive, and limits the gift to a certain number. And to examine our right to it, we need not ascend up into heaven, to search the rolls of the eternal counsels; for all whom the Father hath given him shall come unto him, and not only receive him as their High Priest, but give up themselves to be ruled and guided by him, by the efficacious working of the Spirit of his grace. By such a receiving of Christ, and giving up of ourselves to his conduct and government, we shall know whether we be of the number of those that are given to Christ; and till we find this, we have no reason to conclude it, but to fear and suspect the contrary. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As thou hast given him power over all flesh,.... All men, in distinction from angels; and these as fallen, as weak, frail, sinful, and mortal creatures; men of every nation, Jew or Gentile, and of every character, elect or non-elect: not but that he has also a power over angels; nor is his power over men limited to their "flesh" or bodies, but reaches to their spirits or souls also: which power is a governing, disposing, and judicial one; he rules them with a sceptre of righteousness, he disposes of them in providence as he pleases, and will judge them at the last day: and this is a power that is "given" him by his Father, and is not that original power over all things he has as God, and the Creator of them, which is natural, essential, and underived; but is a derived and delegated power, which he has as Mediator, as subservient to the ends and designs of his office: and as God glorified him as such, by giving him this power; so he glorifies him again, by acknowledging it, and by using it for the end for which it is given: <p>that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him; eternal life is a gift, and not owing to the merits of men; indeed there is no merit in men's works, no, not in the best; for these are previously due to God, cannot be profitable to him, if done aright, are not done in the creature's strength, but through the grace of God, and bear no proportion to eternal life; which is in Christ's gift: not only the promise of it is in him, but that itself; it is put into his hands, and he came into this world, that his people might have it; he has procured it, and has removed what lay in the way of their enjoyment of it; he has a right to bestow it, and their right unto it comes by him, through his blood and righteousness: the persons on whom he confers this gift, are not all men, but such as the Father in the everlasting covenant has given to him, as his people and portion, his spouse and children, his jewels and his treasure, to be saved and enjoyed by him; whom he has chosen and preserved in him, and made his care and charge; to these, and every one of these, Christ gives this great blessing; nor shalt any of them come short of it; and it is for the sake of this, that all creatures and things, all power in heaven and in earth, are given to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As thou hast given him power over <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</span><p>(a) Over all men.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/17.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm" title="As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.">John 17:2</a>.

The redeemed humanity of all time has been given to the incarnate Son, and is undoubtedly different from the (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>) "all flesh" of the previous clause, but it is further explained to mean the individual men and women who receive from him eternal life. The bestowment of eternal life on those thus given to him is the method in which he will glorify the Father (see notes on John 6:37, where the Father is said to draw men to himself by means of the unveiling of his own true character in the Son, and where this <span class="accented">drawing</span> is seen to be another way of describing the Father's <span class="accented">gift</span> to the Son). Those who are given to Christ are those who are drawn by the Father's grace to see his perfect self-revelation in the face of Jesus Christ, of whom Jesus says, "I will by no means cast them out" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>), and concerning whom he avers, "No one cometh unto the Father but by me" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">life</span> eternal, is frequently described as his gift. From the first the evangelist has regarded <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span> as the inherent and inalienable prerogative of the "Logos," and the source of all the "light" which has lighted men. This "life," which is "light," came into the world in his birth, and became the head of a new humanity. It is clearly more than, and profoundly different from, the principle of unending existence. Life is more than perpetuity of being, and eternity is not endlessness, nor is "eternal life" a mere prolongation of duration; it refers rather to state and quality than to one condition of that state; it is the negation of time rather than indefinite or infinite prolongation of time. That which Christ gives to those who believe in him, receive him, is the life of God himself. It is strongly urged by many that this eternal life is a present realizable possession, that he that hath the Son hath life, and that we are to disregard the future in the conscious enjoyment of this blessedness; but we must not forget that our Lord obviously refers the life eternal to the future in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-30.htm">Mark 10:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-30.htm">Luke 18:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>. Nor are these statements, as some have said, incompatible with the representations of this Gospel (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40, 54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>). The aionian blessedness may have a partial realization here and now, but not fill our vision is less clouded and our perils are less severe shall we fully apprehend it. Nor is this inconsistent with Ver. 3. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Power (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., rightly, authority.
