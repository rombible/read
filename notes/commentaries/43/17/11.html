The prosperity of the soul is the best prosperity. He pleaded with his holy Father, that he would keep them by his power and for his glory, that they might be united in affection and labours, even according to the union of the Father and the Son. He did not pray that his disciples should be removed out of the world, that they might escape the rage of men, for they had a great work to do for the glory of God, and the benefit of mankind. But he prayed that the Father would keep them from the evil, from being corrupted by the world, the remains of sin in their hearts, and from the power and craft of Satan. So that they might pass through the world as through an enemy's country, as he had done. They are not left here to pursue the same objects as the men around them, but to glorify God, and to serve their generation.

They will need the same protection which I could give them if I were with them.<p>Keep - Preserve, defend, sustain them in trials, and save them from apostasy.<p>Through thine own name - Our translators seem to have understood this expression as meaning "keep by thy power," but this probably is not its meaning. It is literally "keep in thy name." And if the term name be taken to denote God himself and his perfections (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-6.htm">John 17:6</a>), it means "keep in the knowledge of thyself. Preserve them in obedience to thee and to thy cause.

Any other union between Christians is impossible; but a union of affection is what the Saviour sought, and this he desired might be so strong as to be an illustration of the unchanging love between the Father and the Son.

I am coming to thee, therefore I commend them to thee, beseeching thee, that thou through thy power wouldst keep those, who, in giving themselves up to me, have also given themselves up to thee; let their owning thy name (which is as a strong tower, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-10.htm" title="The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runs into it, and is safe.">Proverbs 18:10</a></span>) keep them from all the temptations and dangers to which they will be exposed in the world, wherein they are to live and converse; <span class="ital">that they may be one, </span> one body, and in one Spirit: that they may own one Lord, one faith, one baptism, &c.; that they may be one in love and affection, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">as we are; </span> in some proportion to that union which is between thee and me, though not in an equality. This prayer of our Saviour’s doth both oblige all those who in any sincerity own Christ, to study union both in opinion and affection; and also give us ground of hopes, that there is a time coming, when there shall be greater measure of it than we have seen in those miserably divided times wherein we have lived, and do yet live. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And now I am no more in the world,.... In the earth; which is no contradiction to his resurrection from the dead, and stay with his disciples for a while; nor to his return to judge the world at the last day; nor to his reigning on earth with his saints a thousand years; since it will not be the world as it now is, but it will be a new earth, renewed, purified and refined, and clear of the wicked inhabitants of it; and in which will only dwell righteous persons: besides, Christ was to be, and will be no more in the world, in such circumstances, and doing such work as he then was: the meaning is, that whereas he had been in the world, and had done, or as good as done the work he came about, he was now just going out of it; it was but a very little while he had to stay in it; nor should he continue long with his disciples when he rose from the dead; and whereas his bodily presence had been a guard unto them, a protection of them, and he had bore the heat and burden of the day for them, and had took all reproaches and persecutions upon himself, now he was going from them: <p>but these are in the world; and will continue for some time, they having much work to do, and be exposed to the evils, snares and temptations of it; where they were hated, and were liable to great hardships, afflictions and persecutions; which shows that Christ was not so intent on his own glory, as to neglect the good of his people, and to be unconcerned for them: <p>and I come to thee; signifying his death; the deposition of his soul into his Father's hands; his ascension in soul and body to him; his entrance into heaven, and session at the right hand of God; and therefore had nothing to ask for on his own account: but his disciples he was parting with lay near his heart, and therefore he prays; <p>holy Father, keep, through thine own name, those whom thou hast given me: the person prayed unto is God the Father, the Father of Christ, and of his people; a very proper relation to consider God in and under in prayer to him: since it must give freedom, boldness, and hope of success: the epithet "holy" is exceeding suitable, as it perfectly agrees with him who is essentially so; and since it was holiness and an increase of it Christ prays for; and that there his disciples might be kept from the evil of sin: the persons prayed for are those that were given to Christ in election, and in the covenant, to be kept by him, and therefore he is the more solicitous for their preservation: his request is, that his Father would keep them from the evil of the world; from sinking under temptations and afflictions; faithful to him and to his Gospel, and in unity among themselves; and that "through" or "in" his own name; in it, in the doctrine of the Gospel, and in the worship of God, and profession of him; "through" it, through himself, as a wall of fire about them, and by his power through faith unto salvation: <p>that they may be one as we are; in nature, will, affection and understanding; which must be understood not of equality, but of likeness; and designs not their union to Christ, but to one another; abiding together, cleaving to each other, standing fast in one Spirit, having the same designs, and the interest of a Redeemer in view, and at heart. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee.

This grand title stands here in solitary grandeur (though let Ver. 25, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>, be noticed, and the fact that <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a> speaks of "the Holy and True," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a> of "the Holy One"). The very holiness of the Father is appealed to as the surest basis of the petition. They have already been taught to pray, "Hallowed [made holy] be thy Name." The eternal holiness and righteousness of God is involved in the saving and sanctification of the believer in Jesus. "<span class="accented">Keep</span> them, holy Father" (says our Lord), <span class="cmt_word">in and by thy Name, those whom thou hast given me.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is the reading of the T.R., on the very feeble authority from the codices, simply D2, 69, and some versions. It is also thus quoted by Epiphanius twice; but the reading of all the best uncial manuscripts, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, L, Y, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x394;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3a0;</span>, etc., numerous versions and quotations, is <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. Some very unimportant manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span>, which Godet prefers as practically equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x7b;&#x3c2;</span>, regarded as a unity, "that which," and as calculated to explain the <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span> of the uncials, and the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;</span>. Lachmann, Tischendorf (8th edit.), Tregelles, Meyer, Westcott and Herr, and R.T. all read <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span>, which is thrown by attraction to <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> into the dative, and requires the translation, <span class="cmt_word">Keep them</span> (<span class="accented">in</span> or <span class="accented">by</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>in the power of thy Name which thou hast given me</span>. And since <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;</span> is a resolution of the attraction, it is quite as likely that <span class="accented">it</span> is a correction of <span class="greek">&#x1ff7;</span> as that the reverse process should have taken place. The expression is very peculiar, but not inexplicable. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a> is the best illustration of the clause. It reads, according to the true text, "<span class="accented">He</span> hath bestowed on him the Name (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) which is above every name," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the eternal Name, the incommunicable Name (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>) of Jehovah. Meyer objects to this that the Father's Name was simply given him as an ambassador or for purposes of revelation and manifestation. This may be a partial limitation of the thought. He has already said, "<span class="accented">I</span> have manifested thy Name, thy fatherhood to the men," etc. And now he adds, "<span class="accented">Keep</span> them in the power and grace of this glorious Name, of which my Person and message have been the full expression." <span class="cmt_word">That they may be one</span>, united, formed into a unity of being, <span class="cmt_word">even as we are</span>, not losing their personality, but blending and interchanging their interests and their affections after the Divine pattern of the Father and Son. The relations between Christians, which constitute the essential unity of their corporate being, are of the same kind as those which pertain to Christ and God, and prevail between them, therefore lying far behind the shifting phases of organization and human order, in the essence and substance of spiritual life. Some writers have found in this analogy between the union of believers and the hypostatic union of the Persons of the Godhead, either a species of tritheism in the Godhead, or a minimizing of the entire conception to what is called moral union between the Father-God and his Son Jesus Christ. But the effect of the utterance is rather to lift the idea of the unity of the body of Christ to a superlative height, and to interpret still further the nature of its oneness with the Father and Son (see Ver. 23). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I come (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>I am coming.
