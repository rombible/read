The thought of their being still in the world leads on to their mission in the world, and the prayer passes from the thought of preservation to that of their sanctification for their work. Their fitness for this is prominent in this verse. Already they are not of the world, even as He is not of the world.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:11-16 Christ does not pray that they might be rich and great in the world, but that they might be kept from sin, strengthened for their duty, and brought safe to heaven. The prosperity of the soul is the best prosperity. He pleaded with his holy Father, that he would keep them by his power and for his glory, that they might be united in affection and labours, even according to the union of the Father and the Son. He did not pray that his disciples should be removed out of the world, that they might escape the rage of men, for they had a great work to do for the glory of God, and the benefit of mankind. But he prayed that the Father would keep them from the evil, from being corrupted by the world, the remains of sin in their hearts, and from the power and craft of Satan. So that they might pass through the world as through an enemy's country, as he had done. They are not left here to pursue the same objects as the men around them, but to glorify God, and to serve their generation. The Spirit of God in true Christians is opposed to the spirit of the world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

The reading <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σου</span> is a <span class="ital">correct</span>, more precise definition arising from a gloss.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος ὁ σὸς ἀλήθ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐστι</span>] a supporting of the prayer, in which <span class="greekheb">ὁ σός</span> has peculiar weight; <span class="ital">Thy word</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-24.htm" title="He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.">John 14:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-49.htm" title="For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.">John 12:49</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-16.htm" title="Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.">John 7:16</a>), the word of no other, <span class="ital">is truth</span>. How shouldst Thou, then, not grant the <span class="greekheb">ἁγιάζειν</span> prayed for?

But here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-16.htm" title="They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.">John 17:16</a>, the <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου</span>, <span class="ital">of the world</span>, being put twice in the first place, bears the emphasis of the sentence, in antithesis to <span class="greekheb">ἁγίασον</span>, <span class="ital">sanctify</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-17.htm" title="Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth.">John 17:17</a>.

This verse simply repeats, with alteration of order, the clause of Ver. 14 as the basis of the next great petition. Ver. 14 draws the comparison between Christ and the disciples; Ver. 16 lays, by a transposition of words, the greater emphasis on "the world." Alas that this great utterance should so often be utterly ignored! How often in our own days, is other-worldliness and unworldliness derided as a pestilent heresy, and "a man of the world," instinct with its purpose and saturated with its spirit, lauded as the true man and ideal leader of a Christian state! </body></html>
