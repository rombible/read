The thought is, “For they are Thine (and all My things are Thine, and Thy things are Mine), and I am glorified in them.” The fact that Christ is glorified in them forms, then, a second reason for His special prayer for them. The tense is perfect. Its accomplishment is already in part realised (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6-8</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-8.htm" title="Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.">John 15:8</a>), and is more fully to be realised in that future of the Spirit’s work which all through this chapter is regarded as present. (Comp.

Christ prays for those that are his. Thou gavest them me, as sheep to the shepherd, to be kept; as a patient to the physician, to be cured; as children to a tutor, to be taught: thus he will deliver up his charge. It is a great satisfaction to us, in our reliance upon Christ, that he, all he is and has, and all he said and did, all he is doing and will do, are of God. Christ offered this prayer for his people alone as believers; not for the world at large. Yet no one who desires to come to the Father, and is conscious that he is unworthy to come in his own name, need be discouraged by the Saviour's declaration, for he is both able and willing to save to the uttermost, all that come unto God by him. Earnest convictions and desires, are hopeful tokens of a work already wrought in a man; they begin to evidence that he has been chosen unto salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth. They are thine; wilt thou not provide for thine own? Wilt thou not secure them? Observe the foundation on which this plea is grounded, All mine are thine, and thine are mine. This speaks the Father and Son to be one. All mine are thine. The Son owns none for his, that are not devoted to the service of the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I pray for them - In view of their dangers and trials, he sought the protection and blessing of God on them. His prayer was always answered.<p>Not for the world - The term world here, as elsewhere, refers to wicked, rebellious, vicious men. The meaning of this expression here seems to be this: Jesus is praying for his disciples. As a reason why God should bless them, he says that they were not of the world; that they had been taken out of the world; that they belonged unto God. The petition was not offered for wicked, perverse, rebellious men, but for those who were the friends of God and were disposed to receive his favors. This passage, then, settles nothing about the question whether Christ prayed for sinners. He then prayed for his disciples, who were not those who hated him and disregarded his favors. He afterward extended the prayer for all who should become Christians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-20.htm">John 17:20</a>. When on the cross he prayed for his crucifiers and murderers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>.<p>For they are thine - This is urged as a reason why God should protect and guide them. His honor was concerned in keeping them; and we may always "fill our mouths with" such "arguments" when we come before God, and plead that his honor will be advanced by keeping us from evil, and granting us all needful grace.<p>I am glorified in them - I am honored by their preaching and lives. The sense of this passage is, "Those who are my disciples are thine. That which promotes my honor will also promote thine. I pray, therefore, that they may have needful grace to honor my gospel, and to proclaim it among men." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. all mine are thine, and thine are mine&#8212;literally, "All My things are Thine and Thy things are Mine." (On this use of the neuter gender, see on [1879]Joh 6:37-40). Absolute COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY between the Father and the Son is here expressed as nakedly as words can do it. (See on [1880]Joh 17:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In the Greek the adjectives are of the neuter gender, so as the sense is not, All my friends, or all my disciples, are thine also; but, All my things are thine, and all thy things are mine; which is no more than he hath before often said. Christ and his Father have all things common, neither of them have any thing that is not the other’s: they are one, and they agree in one; they have the same essence, the same will, the same attributes, the same friends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And I am</span> (saith our Saviour) <span class="bld">glorified, </span> or made glorious, <span class="bld">in them, </span> by their owning, receiving, and embracing me, and accepting me as their Saviour.

Christ is speaking not of things but of persons; otherwise all the perfections of his nature as God, and all the works he did, and doctrines he taught as man, were of his Father; as all the perfections of his Father, his nature, his names, his works, his worship, were his; the same that belongs to the one belongs to the other: but persons are here meant, and these the elect of God, particularly the apostles, who were his and his Father's; belonged to them both by election, covenant transactions, redemption, and efficacious grace in conversion; which mutual interest arises from an union in nature, an agreement in covenant, and a conjunction in operation: <p>and I am glorified in them: or by them, they ascribing all divine perfections, works and worship to him; attributing the whole of their salvation to him, and giving him all the glory of it; believing in him; walking worthy of him, in their lives and conversations; suffering patiently and cheerfully for his sake; and abiding by his Gospel and ordinances; and he will be glorified by them, and in them hereafter, and that to all eternity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/17.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-10.htm" title="And all my are yours, and your are mine; and I am glorified in them.">John 17:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ τὰ ἐμὰ πάντα</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐμά</span>] is parenthetic (on <span class="greekheb">καί</span> <span class="ital">parentheticum</span>, see Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom</span>.

Luther observed, "No creature could say this." Perhaps he went too far, because we are taught to believe that "<span class="accented">all</span> things are ours," etc., and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> covers much (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>). In the full confidence of filial relation we can believe it true that the heavenly Father <span class="accented">says to</span> every one of his veritable children, "<span class="accented">All</span> that I have is thine." Here the words must not be drawn out of their connection; it is human souls who are of God, and are therefore Christ's. The dogmatic lesson is that every one who has heard and learned of the Father does come to him.
