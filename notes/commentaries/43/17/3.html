Eternal life could not be given to believers, unless Christ, their Surety, both glorified the Father, and was glorified of him. This is the sinner's way to eternal life, and when this knowledge shall be made perfect, holiness and happiness will be fully enjoyed. The holiness and happiness of the redeemed, are especially that glory of Christ, and of his Father, which was the joy set before him, for which he endured the cross and despised the shame; this glory was the end of the sorrow of his soul, and in obtaining it he was fully satisfied. Thus we are taught that our glorifying God is needed as an evidence of our interest in Christ, through whom eternal life is God's free gift.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is life eternal - This is the source of eternal life; or it is in this manner that it is to be obtained.

"It includes all the impressions on the mind and life which a just view of God and of the Saviour is fitted to produce." It includes, of course, love, reverence, obedience, honor, gratitude, supreme affection. "To know God as he is" is to know and regard him as a lawgiver, a sovereign, a parent, a friend. It is to yield the whole soul to him, and strive to obey his law.<p>The only true God - The only God, in opposition to all false gods. What is said here is in opposition to idols, not to Jesus himself, who, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>, is called "the true God and eternal life."<p>And Jesus Christ - To know Jesus Christ is to have a practical impression of him as he is - that is, to suffer his character and work to make their due impression on the heart and life. Simply to have heard that there is a Saviour is not to know it. To have been taught in childhood and trained up in the belief of it is not to know it. To know him is to have a just, practical view of him in all his perfections as God and man; as a mediator; as a prophet, a priest, and a king. It is to feel our need of such a Saviour, to see that we are sinners, and to yield the whole soul to him, knowing that he is a Saviour suited to our needs, and that in his hands our souls are safe.

In this verse is contained the sum and essence of the Christian religion, as it is distinguished from all the schemes of idolatry and philosophy, and all the false plans on which men have sought to obtain eternal life. The Gentiles worshipped many gods; the Christian worships one - the living and the true God; the Jew, the Deist, the Muslim, the Socinian, profess to acknowledge one God, without any atoning sacrifice and Mediator; the true Christian approaches him through the great Mediator, equal with the Father, who for us became incarnate, and died that he might reconcile us to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. this is&#8212;that.<p>life eternal, that they might&#8212;may.<p>know, &c.&#8212;This life eternal, then, is not mere conscious and unending existence, but a life of acquaintance with God in Christ (Job 22:21).<p>thee, the only true God&#8212;the sole personal living God; in glorious contrast equally with heathen polytheism, philosophic naturalism, and mystic pantheism.<p>and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent&#8212;This is the only place where our Lord gives Himself this compound name, afterwards so current in apostolic preaching and writing.

"The very juxtaposition here of Jesus Christ with the Father is a proof, by implication, of our Lord's Godhead.

The term <span class="ital">only, </span> or alone, is not exclusive of the other two Persons in the Trinity, but only of idols, the gods of the heathen, which are no gods; so <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-15.htm" title="Which in his times he shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;">1 Timothy 6:15</a>,16</span>, and many other Scriptures: so <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-27.htm" title="All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.">Matthew 11:27</a></span>, where it is said, that <span class="ital">none knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any the Father, save the Son; </span> where the negative doth not exclude the Holy Spirit.

He adds, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent; </span> by which he lets us know, that the Father cannot be savingly known, but in and by the Son.

That is, the beginning and pledge of it, the way unto it, and means of it, and what will certainly issue in it: <p>that they might know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent. The knowledge of God here spoken of, is not the knowledge of him by the light of nature, and works of creation; for a man may know God in this sense, and not know him in Christ, nor anything of Christ; yea, may know God and profess him in words, and in works deny him, as the Heathens did; nor is eternal life known hereby, nor connected with it: nor is it such a knowledge of God as is to be obtained by the law of Moses, in which God is represented as a righteous and incensed Being; nor is there in it any discovery of God, as a God of love, grace, and mercy in Christ; nor any revelation of a Mediator, Saviour and Redeemer; nor can it either show, or give to persons eternal life; and yet what is here said of the knowledge of God and Christ, the Jews say of the law (d), <p>"one man said to his friend, let us dash them against that wall and kill them, because they have left  , "eternal life"; (the gloss upon it is,  "the law";) and employ themselves in a temporary life, the gloss says of this world, which is merchandise.'' <p>More truly does Philo the Jew say (e), that <p>"fleeing to the Divine Being, "is eternal life"; and running front him is death.'' <p>But this is to be understood of an evangelic knowledge of God, as the God and Father of Christ, as the God of all grace, pardoning iniquity, transgression and sin, and of Christ Mediator; not a general, notional, and speculative knowledge; but a practical and experimental one; a knowledge of approbation and appropriation; a fiducial one, whereby a soul believes in Christ, and trusts in his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice for salvation; and which, though imperfect, is progressive. The Arians and Unitarians urge this text, against the true and proper deity of our Lord Jesus, and his equality with the Father, but without success; since the Father is called the only true God, in opposition to the many false gods of the Heathens, but not to the exclusion of the Son or Spirit; for Christ is also styled the one Lord, and only Lord God, but not to the exclusion of the Father; yea the true God and eternal life; was he not, he would never, as here, join himself with the only true God; and besides, eternal life is made to depend as much upon the knowledge of him, as of the Father. The reason of this different mode of expression, is owing to the character of Christ as Mediator, who is said to be sent by the only true God, about the business of man's salvation. Nor is it of any moment what the Jew (f) objects, that Jesus here confesses, that the true God is only one God; nor does he call himself God, only the Messiah sent by God; and that the Apostle Paul also asserts the unity of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm">1 Timothy 1:17</a>; and therefore Jesus cannot be God: for Christ and his Father, the only true God, are one; and that he is the one true God with his Father, he tacitly suggests here by joining himself with him; and what the Apostle Paul says of the one and only wise God, may as well be understood of Christ, the Son of God, as of the Father; since all the characters in the text agree with him, and of him he had been speaking in the context. <p>(d) T.

But the words are not without difficulty, even when, we insert the ‘as;’ and the run of the Greek words is rather against the insertion of ‘as.’ If ‘Christ’ were a predicate and not part of the proper name we should expect ‘Jesus, whom Thou didst send, as Christ.’ Probably in this verse we have the <span class="ital">substance</span> and not the exact words of Christ’s utterance. That He should use the name ‘Jesus’ here is perhaps improbable; that He should anticipate the use of ‘Jesus Christ’ as a proper name is very improbable; and the expression ‘the true God’ is not used elsewhere by Christ and is used by S.

All ideas of God which deviate from or fall short of "the Father" revealed to us by Christ, are not the veritable God, and the knowledge of them is not life eternal. The Father is here set forth as the <span class="accented">fens Deitatis</span>. This does not exclude "the Son," but is inconceivable without him. The Fatherhood expresses an eternal relation. The one element involves the ether as integral to itself: "I am in the Father, and the Father in me." There is a knowledge of the Father possible even now. "Henceforth, he has said, ye have seen him, and known him;" yet not till the veil is lifted, and we see face to face, shall we know as we are known (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>), shall we see him as he is. <span class="cmt_word">And him whom thou didst send, Jesus the Christ</span> (not <span class="accented">Jesus to be</span>, or as <span class="accented">Christ</span>, but rather "Jesus the Christ," as the expansion and explanation of the more indefinite term, "him whom thou didst scud"). Why does our Lord add to this expression one that at first sight seems so incompatible with the idea of this prayer? It has led so careful and reverential a commentator as Westcott to remove the difficulty by supposing that the whole verse is a gloss of the evangelist, expressing the sense of what our Lord may have uttered at greater length. We are loath to admit this method of exegesis, especially as the sole reasons for it are the supposed strangeness of our Lord's here using a phrase so unaccustomed, and thus giving himself not only his Personal Name, but his own official title. It is unusual. The phrase does undoubtedly belong to a later period for its current and constant use. Yet it must not be forgotten <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that this is a unique moment in his career, and unique expressions may be anticipated; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it was calculated to strengthen his disciples, to allow them to hear once from his own lips the solemn claim to Messiahship (see Godet); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that John himself at once adopted it as his own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm">1 John 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-22.htm">1 John 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-1.htm">1 John 5:1-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1, 2, 5</a>); moreover, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a> Jesus Christ is, himself lifted up into the region of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and the apostle adds, "This is the true God, and eternal life" (Hengstenberg). It is from these very words that some critics imagine that the evangelist, rather than the Lord himself, framed the clause; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> yet it is quite as rational to suppose that the words uttered by Jesus dwelt like a strain of sacred music in the memory of the apostle. Moreover, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the knowledge of the only true God is really conditioned by the knowledge of him who was indeed the great Revelation, Organ, and Effluence of the Father's glory. The fullness of this knowledge is the end of all Christian striving. Paul said, "I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus... and that I <span class="accented">may</span> know him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). How much is there yet to know! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> Finally, as our Lord is rising more and more into the glory of an utter self-abandonment, and into the glory which he had with the Father from eternity, the human nature which he still inhabits becomes almost an appendage of his Divine Personality, and he might with awful significance, when referring to the object of human faith and knowledge, say, "Him whom thou hast sent - Jesus the Christ." Moreover, on any hypothesis of the composition or framing of an intercessory prayer for the Logos Christos to utter, there is an equal difficulty in the insertion into such prayer by St. John of this reference to himself as the Christ. The knowledge of the Father as the only true God, in opposition to the heathen traditions and philosophical speculations of the world, coupled with a corresponding knowledge of the only adequate expression of the Father's heart and nature, sent forth from him, as One promised, consecrated, and empowered to represent him, is <span class="accented">life - ere</span> <span class="accented">half life</span>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Life eternal<p>With the article: the life eternal.
