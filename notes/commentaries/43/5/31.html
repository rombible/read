Thus it is said, that a man’s testimony of himself <span class="ital">is not true. </span>A man may certainly give a true testimony of himself; but, in law, it is not evidence; and is therefore held as untrue. This sense of the word often occurs in this gospel.” As if he had said, I have certainly entered a very high claim, and asserted my dignity in very strong terms, but I do not require any man to believe me merely on the authority of my own testimony. <span class="ital">There is another that beareth witness of me </span>— A person of undoubted reputation and veracity. He refers to the testimony of John, given him in the hearing of their own deputies. But at the same time he observed, that the truth of his mission did not depend on human testimony, though it was given by one who was a burning and shining light, and in whom they greatly rejoiced, because the prophetic spirit, which had so long ceased, seemed to be again revived in him. For he proceeds; <span class="ital">But I receive not </span>— Or, I have no need to receive; <span class="ital">testimony from man: but these things </span>— Concerning John, whom ye yourselves reverence; <span class="ital">I say, that ye may be saved </span>— Namely, from that destruction which John foretold would be the portion of those who should reject me. So really and seriously did Christ will their salvation. Yet they were not saved. Most, if not all of them, died in their sins. <span class="ital">He was a burning and a shining light </span>— Inwardly burning with love and zeal; outwardly shining with all holiness. Some infer from this expression that the Baptist was now dead; yet he does not seem to have been killed till a little before the third passover. The reason is, the miracle of the loaves, performed in the desert of Bethsaida immediately after word was brought of John’s death, is said to have happened a little before that feast, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>. If so, our Lord’s meaning is, that John was a burning and a shining light, not while he lay in prison, but while his ministry lasted; for during his imprisonment his light may be said to have been extinguished. Accordingly it is added, <span class="ital">And ye were willing for a season </span>— <span class="greekheb">Προς ωραν</span>, for an hour; <span class="ital">to rejoice in his light </span>— Ye hearkened to him with great pleasure, till his credit was impaired in your estimation by his imprisonment. Or the meaning may be, that they did not continue long to manifest that regard for his preaching, which, at his first appearance, they seemed to promise; because his doctrine was too strict and severe to be approved of, or endured long by so carnal and worldly-minded a people.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:30-38 Our Lord returns to his declaration of the entire agreement between the Father and the Son, and declared himself the Son of God. He had higher testimony than that of John; his works bore witness to all he had said. But the Divine word had no abiding-place in their hearts, as they refused to believe in Him whom the Father had sent, according to his ancient promises. The voice of God, accompanied by the power of the Holy Ghost, thus made effectual to the conversion of sinners, still proclaims that this is the beloved Son, in whom the Father is well pleased. But when the hearts of men are full of pride, ambition, and the love of the world, there is no room for the word of God to abide in them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I bear witness of myself - If I have no other evidence than my own testimony about myself.<p>My witness - My testimony; my evidence.

Which was not allowed any man to do; nor indeed is it proper that a man should be a witness in his own cause: and, according to the Jewish canons, a man might not be a witness for his wife, because she was reckoned as himself. <p>"An husband is not to be believed in bearing witness for his wife, that had been carried captive, that she is not defiled,   , "for no man witness of himself" (k).'' <p>So likewise they say (l), <p>"a city that is subdued by an army, all the priestesses (or priests' daughters) that are found in it are rejected (from the priesthood, as defiled); but if they have witnesses, whether a servant, or an handmaid, lo, they are to be believed; but no man is to be believed for himself: says R. Zechariah ben Hakatzah, by this habitation (swearing by the temple) her hand was not removed from my hand, from the time the Gentiles entered Jerusalem, till they went out: they replied to him, "no man bears witness of himself".'' <p>Christ reasons here upon their own principles, and according to their sense of things, that should he bear witness of himself; then, says he, <p>my witness is not true, , not to be believed, or admitted as an authentic testimony: and so the Ethiopic version renders it, "is not credible"; not valid in law, or in such a court of judicature in which Christ now was; for, as according to the Jewish law, no man was admitted a witness for himself, so neither was anything established by a single testimony, but by the mouth of two or three witnesses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>. Christ's meaning is, that his testimony alone, his single witness, how true soever it was, would stand for nothing in their court; and therefore he would not insist upon it, but drop it; for "true" here, is not opposed to that which is "false", but to that which is not valid in law. Christ's testimony was true in itself; nor could it be any other, it coming from him, who is truth itself, the "Amen", and faithful witness; but being considered as an human testimony, and in his own cause, was not to be admitted as sufficient; and this he allows. From arguments, proving his equality with the Father, he passes to testimonies; and without ranking use of his own, he had enough to produce, and which were valid and authentic, and are as follow. <p>(k) Maimon.

Jesus anticipates the objection, that these great claims were made solely on His own authority [<span class="greekheb">ἔγνω τοὺς Ἰουδαίους ἐνθυμουμένους ἀντιθεῖναι</span>, Euthym.]. The Jewish law is given by Wetstein, “Testibus de se ipsis non credunt,” or “Homo non est fide dignus de se ipso,” and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-15.htm" title="One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sins: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>. The same law prevailed among the Greeks, <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρεῖν γὰρ οἱ νόμοι οὐκ ἐῶσιν αὐτὸν ἑαυτῷ</span> (Demosth., <span class="ital">De Cor.</span>, 2), and among the Romans, “more majorum comparatum est, ut in minimis rebus homines amplissimi testimonium de sua re non dicerent” (Cicero, <span class="ital">Proverbs Roscio</span>, 36, Wetstein). Grotius says: “Romani dicunt neminem idoneum testem esse in re sua”. But how can Jesus say that if His witness stands alone it is not true? Chrysostom says He speaks not absolutely but with reference to their suspicion [<span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὴν ἐκείνων ὑπόνοιαν</span>]. And on occasion He can maintain that His testimony of Himself is true, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-13.htm" title="The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bore record of yourself; your record is not true.">John 8:13</a>, where He says “Though I witness of myself my witness is true,” and demands that He be considered one of the two witnesses required. Here the point of view is different, and He means: Were I standing alone, unauthenticated by the Father, my claims would not be worthy of credit. But <span class="greekheb">ἄλλος ἐστὶν ὁ μαρτυρῶν περὶ ἐμοῦ</span> (on the definite predicate with indefinite subject <span class="ital">vide</span> Winer, p. 136). “It is another that beareth witness of me,” namely, the Father [<span class="greekheb">σημαίνει τὸν ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς ὄντα θεὸν καὶ Πατέρα</span>, Cyril, Melanchthon, and the best modern interpreters, Holtzmann, Weiss, Westcott]. Grotius, following Chrysostom and Euthymius, says “facillimum est ut de Johanne sumamus, quia de eo sunt quae proxime sequuntur”. Against this is (1) the disclaimer of John’s testimony, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-34.htm" title="But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that you might be saved.">John 5:34</a>; (2) and especially the accentuated opposition of <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-33.htm" title="You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.">John 5:33</a>, and <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-34.htm" title="But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that you might be saved.">John 5:34</a>. For other reasons, see Lücke. Of this witness Jesus says <span class="greekheb">οἶδα ὅτι</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐμοῦ</span>. Why this addition? Is it an overflow of satisfaction in the unassailable position this testimony gives Him? Rather it is the offset to the supposition made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-31.htm" title="If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.">John 5:31</a>, “my witness is not true”.

Why and how can this Teacher take such ground as to assert about himself what no prophet, no rabbi, no chief priest of the people, not even the greatest man of men, Moses himself, had ever dared to claim?

The absolute unison with the Father, which he was not only conscious of, but had also revealed to the Pharisees, lifted his own word to the grandeur of a word of God. The Divine beamed through the human, the infinite through the finite. Here he says, "<span class="accented">If I bear</span> - if I and I alone were bearing <span class="accented">witness</span> to myself," then - supposing a case, which, as a matter of fact, is impossible - "<span class="accented">my</span> <span class="accented">witness is not true."</span> If he were acting alone, which is an inconceivable supposition, seeing that in the depths of his consciousness he knew that he was one with the Father, then for his human nature to break away thus from the Father and disdain his testimony would nullify and falsify his witness.
