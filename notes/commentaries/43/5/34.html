The substantive, and verbs from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-31.htm" title="If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.">John 5:31</a>, have been rendered by “witness,” and it is better to keep it here. The English also fails to give the article, and is therefore misleading. He did receive witness from men—had received witness from John—but this was not <span class= "ital">the witness</span> upon which all was based. Its purpose was to lead them to Christ Himself, and He now refers to it, to show them its true position, that that purpose might be fulfilled.<p><span class= "bld">But these things I say, that ye might be saved.</span>—The emphasis of the clause should be placed upon the pronoun “ye.” The thought is, that our Lord does not refer to John’s witness for His own sake, but in order that they might be saved. He had a greater witness than that of John, but this they were not yet prepared to receive. They had received John for a season, and had rejoiced in his light. He refers to him now that that light may lead them to the true Source of Light. Some of those who had sent to the Baptist may now understand his words in a deeper sense than any which had come to them before, and may find in them words leading to salvation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:30-38 Our Lord returns to his declaration of the entire agreement between the Father and the Son, and declared himself the Son of God. He had higher testimony than that of John; his works bore witness to all he had said. But the Divine word had no abiding-place in their hearts, as they refused to believe in Him whom the Father had sent, according to his ancient promises. The voice of God, accompanied by the power of the Holy Ghost, thus made effectual to the conversion of sinners, still proclaims that this is the beloved Son, in whom the Father is well pleased. But when the hearts of men are full of pride, ambition, and the love of the world, there is no room for the word of God to abide in them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I receive not testimony from men - I do not depend for proof of my Messiahship on the testimony of men, nor do I pride myself on the commendations or flattery of men.<p>But these things ... - "This testimony of John I adduce that you might be convinced. It was evidence of your own seeking. It was clear, full, explicited You 'sent' to make inquiry, and he gave you a candid and satisfactory answer. Had you believed that, you would have believed in the Messiah and been saved." Men are often dissatisfied with the very evidence of the truth of religion which they sought, and on which they professed themselves willing to rely. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33-35.

That must be truth, to which any one can give a true testimony. John by his testimony added nothing to me. I was what I am before John testified concerning me.

He stood in no need of an human testimony, nor did he rest the truth of his deity and divine sonship thereon: he had other and greater testimonies to produce; as he needed not that any man should testify of man to him, he had no need that any man should testify of him; and if the testimony of men was received, as this of John could not well be objected to, the testimony of God is greater, and which he had; and therefore should not have mentioned John's for his own sake: <p>but these things I say, that ye might be saved; that is, he produced this testimony of John, who was a person of so great a character among them, that they might be induced by it to believe in him as the Messiah; and so be saved from that ruin and destruction, that would come upon their nation, city, and temple, for their rejection and disbelief of him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-34.htm" title="But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that you might be saved.">John 5:34</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ δὲ οὐ</span> … but for my part I do not depend upon a man’s testimony.

So too Lücke. Godet and Westcott prefer to emphasise the article, “<span class="ital">the</span> testimony,” “the only real, infallible, unexceptionable testimony,” I do not accept from man. The sense is: You sent to John and he testified to the truth; but the testimony which! for my part accept and rely upon is not that of a man.

But this is unnecessary, for emphasis is laid on the article, "the witness," which is real, infallible, convincing, commanding, must come from the highest source of all. Yet, though Christ cannot depend upon John's testimony, it ought to have had weight with his hearers. It called them to repentance, to holy living, to faith in the Coming One. It discounted their pride in Abrahamic birth, and their false notions of race purity; it made personal and individual that which had been looked at as a national monopoly of privilege. Nay, more, it had testified that he was the "Lamb of God" and the "Son of God" and the "Bridegroom of the Church." Therefore he continued: <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit, these things I say -</span> I call attention to the sum total of his message, the testimony he bore to truth - <span class="cmt_word">that ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">may be saved;</span> for all that John said was true. "John did no miracle: but all things that he said concerning Jesus were true" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-41.htm">John 10:41</a>; see notes). If the Jews had accepted the testimony of John, they wound not now be cherishing angry and rebellious thought, and have been so blinded to the truth and reality of things. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>But I((&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;)<p>Emphatic, in contrast with ye (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-33.htm">John 5:33</a>).<p>Receive (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-32.htm">John 3:32</a>.<p>Testimony (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., properly the witness.
