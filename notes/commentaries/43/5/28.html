Our Lord first refers to his raising those who were dead in sin, to newness of life, by the power of the Spirit, and then to his raising the dead in their graves. The office of Judge of all men, can only be exercised by one who has all knowledge, and almighty power. May we believe His testimony; thus our faith and hope will be in God, and we shall not come into condemnation.

They are described as "in the graves." Though many have turned to their native dust and perished from human view, yet God sees them, and can regather their remains and raise them up to life. The phrase "all that are in the graves" does not prove that the same particles of matter will be raised up, but it is equivalent to saying "all the dead."

Either at the cure of the man that had been diseased thirty and eight years, as some think; or at the Son of God being also the son of man, as the Syriac version suggests; or rather at the dead hearing the voice of the Son of God, and living upon it; and at his having authority to execute judgment upon all, to govern and defend his own church and people, and in the last day acquit them, and to take vengeance on his and their enemies, both now and hereafter: <p>for the hour is coming, in which all that are in their graves shall hear his voice. This respects the general resurrection; for there will be a resurrection both of the just and unjust, of all that are in their graves; and though all that are dead are not in graves, or interred in the earth, as some are in the sea; yet, because the greater part are in graves, this phrase is chosen to express the universality of the resurrection: and this is also a proof of the resurrection of the same body; for what else are in the graves but bodies? and what else can come forth from them but the same bodies? and the time is hastening on when these bodies shall be quickened, and hear the voice of the Son of God; which whether the same with the voice of the archangel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>; and whether an articulate voice, or a violent clap of thunder, which is the voice of God, or only the exertion of Christ's mighty power is intended, is not easy to determine, and may be needless to inquire. Certain it is, that this voice of Christ will be attended with almighty power, as the effect following upon it will show. The Jews observe (g), that <p>"there are three things which do not come into the world but "by voices"; there is the voice of a living creature, as it is written, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, "in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children", and as it is written, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/30-22.htm">Genesis 30:22</a>, "and God hearkened to her"; and there is the voice of rains, as it is written, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41</a>, "for there is a voice of abundance of rain", and it is written, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>, "the voice of the Lord is upon the waters"; and  , "there is the voice of the resurrection of the dead", as it is written, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, "the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness";'' <p>but that was the voice of John the Baptist.

Christenth</span>. p. 422). The saying, “The world’s history is the world’s judgment,” only partially represents John’s view; in John the last <span class="ital">day</span> is not without the last <span class="ital">judgment</span>, and <span class="ital">this</span> last judgment is with him the <span class="ital">world</span>-judgment. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-18.htm" title="He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.">John 3:18</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-28.htm" title="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,">John 5:28</a>. And another reason for restraining surprise is <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἔρχεται ὥρα</span>, etc. It has been proposed to render this as if <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> were explanatory of <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>, do not wonder at this, that an hour is coming. But (1) <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> usually, though not invariably, refers to what precedes; and (2) when John says “Do not wonder that” so and so, he uses <span class="greekheb">μὴ θαυμάσῃς ὅτι</span> without <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>; and (3) the ordinary rendering suits the passage better: Marvel not at this [that my voice gives life] because a time is coming when there will result from my voice that which if not really greater will strike you more sensibly. The bodily resurrection may be said to be greater than the spiritual as its consummation, completion, and exhibition in results. Besides, the Jews of our Lord’s time looked upon the resurrection as the grand demonstration of God’s power. But here the <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐν τοῖς μνημείοις</span> shows that the surprise is to be occasioned by the fact that even the physically dead shall hear.—<span class="greekheb">πάντες</span> … <span class="greekheb">κρίσεως</span>. That the resurrection is alluded to is shown by the change from <span class="greekheb">οἱ νεκροί</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-25.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.">John 5:25</a> to <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐν τοῖς μνημείοις</span>. Some rise to life, some to <span class="greekheb">κρίσιν</span>, which from its opposition to <span class="greekheb">ζωήν</span> must here be equivalent to <span class="greekheb">κατακρίσιν</span>. If it is asked with regard to the righteous, With what body do they come? much more may it be asked of the condemned. The entrance into life and into condemnation are determined by conduct; how the conduct is determined is not here stated. For the expressions defining the two types of conduct see on chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-20.htm" title="For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved....">John 3:20-21</a>. That the present reception of life is the assurance of resurrection is put strikingly by Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="Now he that has worked us for the selfsame thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit.">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>. The fact that some shall rise to condemnation discloses that even those who have not the Spirit of God in them have some kind of continuous life which maintains them in existence with their personal identity intact from the time of death to the time of resurrection. Also, that the long period spent by some between these two points has not been utilised for bringing them into fellowship with Christ is apparent. In what state they rise or to what condition they go, we are not here told. Beyond the fact of their condemnation their future is left in darkness, and was therefore probably meant to be left in darkness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">Marvel not</span>] Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-7.htm" title="Marvel not that I said to you, You must be born again.">John 3:7</a>.

The Lord announces an event which is in the future altogether. The "and now is," which characterized the first resurrection of which he spoke, is here omitted. The description of the subjects of the resurrection as those "in their graves," contradistinguishes them from "the dead" of ver. 25 - a phrase which will suffer several interpretations. The universality of the summons, and the impossibility of neglecting it or ignoring it, form another marked contrast to the resurrection already referred to. <span class="cmt_word">Marvel not at this!</span> At what? Clearly at the entire statement that the resurrection of dead souls will be the undoubted issue of accepting Christ's word and identifying it with the word of God. <span class="accented">Marvel</span> not that the judgment of the world is entrusted to "the Son," because he is both Son of man as well as Son of God.

Geological time, astronomical aeons, should before this have rebuked our impertinence about the delays of God, and our shallow criticism of the fulness of the times. "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." As compared with geological annals, still less with God's eternities, it is only the day before yesterday when Adam fell; it is only yesterday that Jesus died and rose again, and tomorrow that he will come in his glory. <span class="cmt_word">The hour is coming when all who are in the graves shall hear his voice.</span> The same voice that wakes the spiritually dead shall pierce the clods, shall find the buried dead, shall bring once more into the world of the visible and tangible the long forgotten lived.

The organic clothing of the spirit, which goes on, as St. Paul suggests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>) from the death of the physical body till the coming of the Son of God with glory, does not render this statement more difficult, but more comprehensible. As far as this world is concerned, those who are clothed upon with the house not made with hands - those who are with Christ, are to all appearance dead, and in their "graves," in their memorial places; but they will all hear the voice of the Son, <span class="cmt_word">and they will come, forth; they that have</span> <span class="cmt_word">done</span> <span class="cmt_word">good</span> <span class="cmt_word">things, to the resurrection of life; they that have practised evil things, to the resurrection of judgment</span>. They will come forth from these hiding places of fading memories. Even tombs of prophets and kings are themselves buried, covered by the graves of the many generations that have followed. The grave hidden will come forth into what we call the reality, visibility, tangibility, of things. The hour is coming on apace when Death himself shall be dead, and the mystery of time be finished. They that rise will divide themselves into two classes. The anastasis will have two forms. There is a "resurrection of life" and a "resurrection of judgment." Those who have indeed passed from spiritual death to life will not come into "judgment" (not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) when their anastasis is complete, their judgment is over, their life is secure. When those who have not heard the voice of the Son of God, have not come to the light, who are not of God nor of the truth - men who have deliberately practised "evil things" without compunction or amendment, - when these are called from their tombs, from their shadowy hiding places, into the presence of him who executes judgment, it will be to undergo the (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). We must, indeed, all be made manifest before the judgment throne of Christ, to receive the consequences of "the doing of well" and "the practice of evil." The issue of the one is <span class="accented">life</span>, and of the other is <span class="accented">judgment.</span> The suggestion seems to be that such judgment may issue unfavourably, but the thought is centred upon the process of the judgment. The effort of Reuss and others to draw a marked distinction between the eschatology of the synoptists and of John fails. Christ does not represent the spiritual resurrection as "greater work" than the physical resurrection. On the contrary, white he speaks of the <span class="accented">marvelling</span> of his hearers at his claim to quicken the spiritually dead, yet the ground of their  marvel is emphatically arrested (see ver. 28) until they should recognize to the full the fact that, as Son of God and Son of man, he would call all the dead from their graves. Thoma finds admirable justification for this representation by the Johannist of the Messianic Judge, alike in the Book of Daniel, in the synoptic Gospels, in the Pauline Epistles, and Apocalypse! <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The graves (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., better; tombs. Two words are used in the New Testament for the place of burial, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, and &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; or &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;. The former emphasizes the idea of burial (&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;, to bury); the latter of preserving the memory of the dead; from &#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;, to remind. </body></html>
