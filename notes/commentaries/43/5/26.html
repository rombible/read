The time was come when the dead should hear his voice, as the Son of God, and live. Our Lord first refers to his raising those who were dead in sin, to newness of life, by the power of the Spirit, and then to his raising the dead in their graves. The office of Judge of all men, can only be exercised by one who has all knowledge, and almighty power. May we believe His testimony; thus our faith and hope will be in God, and we shall not come into condemnation. And may His voice reach the hearts of those dead in sin; that they may do works meet for repentance, and prepare for the solemn day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the Father hath life - God is the source of all life. He is thence called the living God, in opposition to idols which have no life. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15</a>; "we preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities (idols) 'unto the living God,'" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>. See also <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18-31</a>.<p>In himself - This means that life in God, or existence, is not derived from any other being. Our life is derived from God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; God "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul" - that is, a living being. All other creatures derive their life from him. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; "thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; thou takest away their breath, they die and return to their dust." But God is underived. He always existed as he is. Psa 90:2; "from everlasting to everlasting thou art God." He is unchangeably the same, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>. It cannot be said that he is "self-existent," because that is an absurdity; no being can originate or create himself; but he is not dependent on any other for "life." Of course, no being can take away his existence; and of course, also, no being can take away his happiness. He has "in himself" infinite sources of happiness, and no other being, no change in his universe can destroy that happiness.<p>So - In a manner like his. It corresponds to the first "as," implying that one is the same as the other; life in the one is the "same," and possessed in the same manner, as in the other.<p>Hath he given - This shows that the power or authority here spoken of was "given" or committed to the Lord Jesus. This evidently does not refer to the manner in which the second person of the Trinity exists, for the power and authority of which Christ here speaks is that which he exercises as "Mediator." It is the power of raising the dead and judging the world. In regard to his divine nature, it is not affirmed here that it is in any manner derived; nor does the fact that God is said to have "given" him this power prove that he was inferior in his nature or that his existence was derived. For:<p>1. It has reference merely "to office." As Mediator, he may be said to have been appointed by the Father.<p>2. Appointment to office does not prove that the one who is appointed is inferior in nature to him who appoints him. A son may be appointed to a particular work by a parent, and yet, in regard to talents and every other qualification, may be equal or superior to the father. He sustains the relation of a son, and in this relation there is an official inferiority. General Washington was not inferior in nature and talents to the men who commissioned him. He simply derived authority from them to do what he was otherwise fully "able" to do. So the Son, "as Mediator," is subject to the Father; yet this proves nothing about his nature.<p>To have life - That is, the right or authority of imparting life to others, whether dead in their graves or in their sins.<p>In himself - There is much that is remarkable in this expression. It is in Him as it is in God. He has the control of it, and can exercise it as he will. The prophets and apostles are never represented as having such power in themselves. They were dependent; they performed miracles in the name of God and of Jesus Christ <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-30.htm">Acts 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-18.htm">Acts 16:18</a>; but Jesus did it by his own name, authority, and power. He had but to speak, and it was done, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>. This wonderful commission he bore from God to raise up the dead as he pleased; to convert sinners when and where he chose; and finally to raise up all the dead, and pronounce on them an eternal doom according to the deeds done in the body. None could do this but he who had the power of creation - equal in omnipotence to the Father, and the power of searching all hearts - equal in omniscience to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. given to the Son, &c.&#8212;Does this refer to the essential life of the Son before all time (Joh 1:4) (as most of the Fathers, and Olshausen, Stier, Alford, &c., among the moderns), or to the purpose of God that this essential life should reside in the Person of the Incarnate Son, and be manifested thus to the world? [Calvin, Lucke, Luthardt, &c.] The question is as difficult as the subject is high. But as all that Christ says of His essential relation to the Father is intended to explain and exalt His mediatorial functions, so the one seems in our Lord's own mind and language mainly the starting-point of the other.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> How the eternal Father <span class="ital">hath life in himself, </span> is obvious to every capacity; for he is the First Mover, and therefore must have his life in and from himself, and not from any other; and he is the First Cause, and therefore that life which floweth from him to all created beings, must first be in him, as in its fountain. But in what sense it is said, that he hath <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">given to the Son to have life in himself</span> whether as God, by his eternal generation, or as the Messiah and Mediator between God and man, and so the fountain of spiritual life to believers, is more questioned. Those who understand it as to the Divine nature, say, that this phrase, <span class="ital">hath life in himself, </span> is expressive of the name Jehovah; and that Christ is proved to be the true Jehovah by what is here said, that he <span class="ital">hath life in himself.</span> But they distinguish betwixt having life from or by himself, and having life in himself; the text saith, it is <span class="ital">given</span> to Christ <span class="ital">to have life in himself.</span> But there are other interpreters, who seem better to understand it of Christ as Mediator, to whom it is given to have life in himself, to communicate to his creatures; and think it is well interpreted by <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4</a></span>, <span class="ital">In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For as the Father hath life in himself,.... Is the living God, the fountain of life, and is the author of life to all living creatures; or rather has eternal life in his mind, his heart, his counsel, and his covenant, and in his hands, for all his chosen ones, which seems to he the peculiar sense here: <p>so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; he hath not only made the purpose of it in him, and given the promise of it to him; but even eternal life itself, he has put into his hands, and secured it in him for them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/5-11.htm">1 John 5:11</a>, to give it to as many as he has given him: and he does give it to all his sheep, so that not one of them shall perish; which shows that he and his Father are one, though not in person, yet as in affection, will and power, so in nature and essence. The Son has life in himself, essentially, originally, and inderivatively as the Father has, being equally the living God, the fountain of life, and donor of it, as he; and therefore this is not a life which he gives, or communicates to him; but eternal life is what the one gives, and the other receives, according to the economy of salvation settled between them: and hence it is, that all that hear Christ's voice spiritually shall live eternally; for these words are a reason of the former, and confirm the truth of them, as well as show the equality of the Son with the Father, in that he is equal to such a trust, as to have eternal life committed to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-26.htm" title="For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;...">John 5:26-27</a>.

But He could not impart it if He had not in Himself a divine and independent fountain of life, like the Father, which the Father, the absolutely living One (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-57.htm" title="As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.">John 6:57</a>), gave Him when He <span class="ital">sent</span> Him into the world to accomplish His Messianic work; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm" title="Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?">John 10:36</a>.

Besides (therefore <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm" title="And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.">John 5:27</a>), if only the <span class="greekheb">ἀκούσαντες</span> (comp. <span class="greekheb">οὓς θέλει</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a>) are to live, and the other <span class="greekheb">νεκροί</span> not, the Son must have received from the Father the warrant and power of judging and of deciding who are to live and who not. This power is given Him by the Father <span class="ital">because He is the Son of man;</span> for in His <span class="ital">incarnation, i.e</span>. in the fact that the Son of <span class="ital">God</span> (incarnate) is a child of <span class="ital">man</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Php 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm" title="But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,">Galatians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>), the <span class="ital">essence</span> of His nature as Redeemer consists, and this consequently is the <span class="ital">reason in the history of redemption</span> why the Father has equipped Him for the Messianic function of judgment. Had the Son of <span class="ital">God</span> not become a child of <span class="ital">man</span>, He could not have been the fulfiller of the Father’s decree of redemption, nor have been entrusted with judicial power. Luthardt (comp. Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 78) says incorrectly: “for God desired to judge the world by means of a <span class="ital">man</span>,” which is a thought much too vague for <span class="ital">this</span> passage, and is borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm" title="Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; whereof he has given assurance to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.">Acts 17:31</a>. De Wette, with whom Brückner concurs (comp. also Reuss), more correctly says: “It denotes the <span class="ital">Logos</span> as a <span class="ital">human manifestation,</span>[213] and in this lies the reason why He judges, <span class="ital">for the hidden God could not be judge</span>.” But this negative and refined definition of the reason given, “because He is the Son of man,” can all the less appropriately be read between the lines, the more it savours of Philonic speculation, and the more current the view of the Deity as a Judge was among the Jews. So, following Augustine, Luther, Castalio, Jansen, and most others, B. Crusius (comp. also Wetstein, who adduces <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm" title="For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.">Hebrews 4:15</a>): “because executing judgment requires direct operation upon mankind.”[214] <span class="ital">Others</span> (Grotius, Lampe, Kuinoel, Lücke, Olshausen, Maier, Bäumlein, Ewald, and most others, now also Tholuck): “<span class="greekheb">υἱὸς ἀνθρ</span>. is He who is <span class="ital">announced</span> in Daniel 7 and in the book of Enoch as <span class="ital">the Messiah</span>” (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.">Matthew 8:20</a>), where the thought has been set forth successively in various ways; Lücke (so also Baeumlein): “because He is the <span class="ital">Messiah</span>, and judgment essentially belongs to the work of the Messiah” (comp. Ewald). Tholuck comes nearest to the right sense: “because He is become man, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. is the <span class="ital">Redeemer</span>, but with this redemption itself the <span class="greekheb">κρίσις</span> also is given.” Hengstenberg: “as a <span class="ital">reward for taking humanity upon Him</span>.” Against the whole explanation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, however, to which Beyschlag, <span class="ital">Christol</span>. p. 29, with his explanation of the <span class="ital">ideal</span> man (the personal standard of divine judgment), adheres, it is decisive that in the N.

The prayer at the grave of Lazarus only proves that Christ exercised the power of life, which was bestowed upon Him as His own, in accordance with the Father’s will.

Akin to this interpretation is that of Weiss, p. 224: “so far as He is a son of man, and <span class="ital">can in human form bring near to men the life-giving revelation of God</span>.” Even thus, however, what is said to be the point of the reason given has to be supplied. This holds also against Godet, who confounds things that differ: “On one side judgment must proceed from the womb of humanity as an ‘hommage à Dieu,’ and on the other it is entrusted by God’s love as a purification of humanity to Him who voluntarily became man.” Groos (in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.

Baeumlein and Beyschlag, to account for the absence of the article, content themselves with saying that <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς ἀνθρ</span>. is the predicate, and therefore (comp. Holtzmann) the point would turn on the meaning of the conception. But the <span class="ital">formal</span> and <span class="ital">unchanging</span> title, <span class="greekheb">ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρ</span>., not agree with that; and, moreover, in this way the omission only of the first article, and not of the second (<span class="greekheb">τοῦ</span>), would be explained; <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου</span> can only mean <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of a man</span>.

As the Father has in Himself, and therefore at His own command, life which He can impart as He will: so by His gift the Son has in Himself life which He can communicate directly to whom He will.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἑαυτῷ</span> [similarly used <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-17.htm" title="And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution rises for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.">Mark 4:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm" title="But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.">John 4:14</a>, etc.] excludes dependence for life on anything external to self. From this it follows that what is so possessed is possessed with uninter rupted fulness, and can at will be imparted.—<span class="greekheb">ἔδωκε</span>, “the tense carries us back beyond time,” says Westcott. This is more than doubtful; although several interpreters suppose the eternal generation of the Son is in view. That is precluded both by the word “gave” [which “denotat id quod non per naturalem generationem, sed per benevolam Patris voluntatem est concessum,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm" title="And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.">Matthew 28:18</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm" title="He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:">Luke 1:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm" title="For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.">John 3:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm" title="All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.">John 6:37</a>, Lampe] and by the context, especially by the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-27.htm" title="And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.">John 5:27</a>. The opinions of the Fathers and Reformers are cited in Lampe. See further Stevens, <span class="ital">Johan.

Comp. ‘the living Father hath sent Me, and I live by the Father’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-57.htm" title="As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.">John 6:57</a>). The Father is the absolutely living One, the Fount of all Life. The Messiah, however, imparts life to all who believe; which He could not do unless He had in Himself a fountain of life; and this the Father <span class="ital">gave</span> Him when He sent Him into the world. The Eternal Generation of the Son from the Father is not here in question; it is the Father’s communication of Divine attributes to the Incarnate Word that is meant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-26.htm" title="For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;">John 5:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔχειν ἐν ἑαυτῷ</span>, <span class="ital">to have in Himself</span>) Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4</a>. “In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - This verse, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, shows that the statement about to follow will sustain some portion of the previous one. Which portion? As it seems to me, the coming clause justifies the alteration of the term "the Son" <span class="accented">into</span> "the Son of God;" and declares, more fully than any other passage in the New Testament, the lofty and unique character of the Sonship which he claimed. <span class="cmt_word">For even as the Father hath life in himself</span> - the sublime assumption of the self-existence and eternal being of the Father, the absolute Possessor of life <span class="accented">per se</span>, the Source ultimate and efficient of all that is connoted by life, the eternal Fountain of life - <span class="cmt_word">in like manner also he gave to the Son to have Life in himself</span>. "He generated," as Augustine has it, "such a Son who should have life in himself, not as a participator in life, but one who should be as he himself is - Life itself." It is the <span class="accented">bona fide</span> expression of community of nature, attribute, quality, and possession of Godhead. In virtue of this utterance, the evangelist, learning from the consciousness of Christ through long years of meditation, under the power of the Spirit, eventually formulated the doctrine of the prologue, "In him was life." "The Son," or the <span class="accented">God-Man</span>, is, so far as this Sonship is concerned, the veritable Son of God with such a fulness of life power and such a fountain of life flowing from him, that his voice is the voice of the Eternal Son. This is the primary meaning, though since the Lord returned to his use of the word "the Son," and since the word "gave" is also employed to denote the stupendous conception, there is also involved in it the declaration that the <span class="accented">God-Man</span>, seeing he is both Son of God and Son of man, is endowed with all the functions of both. In his incarnation he has not lost the infinite fulness of life giving power. "He quickeneth whom he will," having life in himself. His voice is the voice of the Son of God. The glory of the Word who became flesh was the glory of the Only Begotten. The part which this great passage took in the Arian controversy is well known (see Athanasius, 'Discourses against Arians,' 3:3, translated by J.H. Newman). Archdeacon Watkins emphasizes the position that the Lord here speaks of "life in himself," which was given to the Son (God-Man) in virtue of, and as the reward of his sacrificial work. He points to <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>, etc. But Jesus here speaks of a gift already made. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>As - so (&#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;  - &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>The correspondence is that of fact, not of degree.<p>Hath he given (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., more strictly, gave, the aorist tense pointing back to the eternal past. </body></html>
