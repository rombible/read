It is not a question of the form of the Greek word, for it may certainly be either. The English reader therefore is in a position to form his own opinion, and is in possession of almost all the evidence. He should observe that all the parallel verbs in the context are in the indicative—“Ye have neither heard” . . . “nor have seen” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>); “Ye have not His Word . . . ye believe not” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-38.htm" title="And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.">John 5:38</a>); “Ye think that . . . ye have” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>); “Ye will not . . ye might have” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-40.htm" title="And you will not come to me, that you might have life.">John 5:40</a>). Why should there be a sudden change of construction in this instance only?<p>We find, then, this order of thought. (1) God has in the Old Testament witnessed of Me, but ye, with unreceptive hearts, have never heard a voice nor seen a shape of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>). (2) Ye have not His word dwelling in you, or it would have witnessed of Me (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-38.htm" title="And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.">John 5:38</a>). (3) Instead of receiving the Scriptures as a living power within you, ye search and explain the letter of them from without (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>). (4) <span class= "ital">Ye</span> think they contain eternal life, and hence your reverence for them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.">John 5:39</a>). (5) They really are witnesses of Me, and yet you; seeking in them eternal life, are not willing to come to Me that ye may have this life.<p>It is believed that this is the most natural interpretation of the words, and that it gives a fuller meaning than any other to the teaching of Christ.<p>The only objection to it of weight is that the Greek word for “search” (<span class= "greekheb">ἐρευνᾶτε</span>) is one which would not have implied blame. It means to search after, track, inquire after (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-52.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee rises no prophet.">John 7:52</a>); but, surely, this is just the expression for the literal spirit in which the Rabbis treated their Scriptures. Moreover, it is not the searching which is matter for blame, but the fact of the searching and not finding, which is matter for wonder.<p>Here, too, as elsewhere, the argument from the meaning of a Greek word must be pressed only within strict limits when we remember that it represents in translation a late Hebrew original. The Hebrew language had a word which just at that time was frequent on every Rabbi’s lips, and which exactly corresponds to it. As early as the Book of Chronicles we find mention of the <span class= "ital">Midrashim,</span> or <span class= "ital">Commentaries</span> in the sense in which this word is used, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in “Cæsar’s <span class= "ital">Commentaries.”</span> The rest of the Acts of Abijah are “written in the Midrash of the prophet Iddo” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-22.htm" title="And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.">2Chronicles 13:22</a>). More than we now know of the history of Joash is “written in the Midrash of the Book of Kings” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-27.htm" title="Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid on him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.">2Chronicles 24:27</a>). In both cases our Authorised version renders the word by “story;” but this was at a time when its connection with “history” as involving “inquiry” was not forgotten. (Comp. <span class= "ital">The Translators to the Reader:</span>—“This will be easily granted by as many as know story, or have any experience.”) These Midrashim sprang up after the Captivity, when the people had lost the older language of the Law and the Prophets; and paraphrases, expositions, and homilies, became at first indeed necessary, but grew into a vast and intricate system with “Secrets” and “Precepts,” and “Fences” and “Traditions of Elders” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-2.htm" title="Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.">Matthew 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-3.htm" title="For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.">Mark 7:3</a>), which gave abundant room for the learning and pride of men, but made the word of God of none effect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-6.htm" title="And honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have you made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.">Matthew 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-13.htm" title="Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which you have delivered: and many such like things do you.">Mark 7:13</a>). Now, the period of the arrangement of the Midrashim of the Law commenced half a century before the ministry of Christ. Hillel the First succeeded to the presidency of the Sanhedrin, B.C. 30, and Akiba, his successor in the compilation of the Mishna, was a boy when these words were spoken. The influence of the former was all-powerful among those who now accused Jesus of breaking what the Law did not contain but the Midrash did. Those who now listened to Christ were disciples or assistants of the great Rabbi whose school of a thousand pupils left eighty names of note.<p>May it not be, then, that the true meaning of these words is to be found in their bearing upon these Rabbinic lives and works?—“Ye make your Midrashim on the Scriptures; ye explain, and comment, and seek for hidden mystic meaning; ye do all this because ye think they contain eternal life; their true meaning is not hidden; they tell of life, and ye who seek it do not hear them, and will not come unto Me that ye might have life.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-39.htm" title="Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me....">John 5:39-40</a></span>. <span class="ital">Search the Scriptures </span>— Because the Jews were exceedingly averse to acknowledge Jesus for their Messiah, notwithstanding that the evidences of his mission were so unexceptionable, he appeals, lastly, to their own scriptures, which, for further proof, and their full satisfaction, he desires them to search, because these writings, as they justly supposed, contained the knowledge of eternal life, and of the way leading to it, and therefore the knowledge of the Messiah. As if he had said, I can with confidence refer you to them, knowing that they confirm my pretensions in the most ample manner, the characters of the Messiah pointed out by them, being all fulfilled in my person. It must be observed that the word <span class="greekheb">ερευνατε</span>, here rendered imperatively, <span class="ital">search, </span>may with equal propriety be translated as Le Clerc, L’Enfant, Vitringa, Raphelius, &c., contend it ought to be, in the present tense, <span class="ital">ye search, </span>the ambiguity of the word justifying either translation. If thus rendered, the sense of the passage will be; <span class="ital">Ye search the Scriptures, because in them ye think ye have eternal life, </span>or, infallible directions from God, concerning the true way of obtaining it. Now <span class="ital">they testify of me; </span>yet, or, nevertheless, <span class="ital">ye will not come to me that ye might have life. </span>— Dr. Doddridge, who reads the clause in that manner, observes, he thinks the following words, which express their high opinion of the Scriptures, rather suit this translation than the common one, and that it is exceeding probable that, at a time when the Pharisees were so impatient of the Roman yoke, they would with great diligence search the sacred oracles for predictions relating to the Messiah; though it is too plain they had an unhappy bias on their minds, which prevented the good effects which might have been expected from that inquiry, had it been impartial. It must be observed, however, that Origen, Chrysostom, and Austin, confirm our version, which certainly is fully as agreeable to the scope of the passage; for having told them that they would find abundant evidence of his mission in the Scriptures, he observed, that their want of faith was not owing to any deficiency in the proofs of his mission, but to the wickedness and obstinacy of their own dispositions. It is justly observed by Grotius, on the word <span class="greekheb">ερευνατε</span>, <span class="ital">search, </span>or, <span class="ital">ye search, </span>that it does not merely mean <span class="ital">to read, </span>but to weigh and consider with an attentive mind, as it is taken <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-52.htm" title="They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee rises no prophet.">John 7:52</a>, where the Jews bid Nicodemus <span class="ital">search and look; </span>and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/1-10.htm" title="Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you:...">1 Peter 1:10-11</a>, where we read of the ancient prophets <span class="ital">inquiring and searching diligently, </span>respecting the salvation to be received through the Messiah, and the time of its manifestation, of which they had prophesied. The expression means the same with that used <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-11.htm" title="These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.">Acts 17:11</a>, namely, <span class="greekheb">ανακρινειν τας γραφας</span>, where we read of the Jews at Berea <span class="ital">searching the Scriptures daily, </span>to know whether the things declared to them by Paul and Silas really accorded with those divine oracles or not. <span class="ital">For in them ye think </span>— Or rather, as <span class="greekheb">δοκειτε </span>evidently means, <span class="ital">ye know, </span>or, <span class="ital">are assured; ye have eternal life </span>— Ye know they show you the way to eternal life; and these very Scriptures testify of me, and of the necessity of believing in, receiving and obeying me, in order thereto. <span class="ital">And </span>yet, such is the obstinacy of your hearts, that, notwithstanding you profess so great a regard for them, <span class="ital">ye will not come to me </span>— Will not believe in, and make application to me; <span class="ital">that ye may have life </span>— Even that eternal life which they direct you to seek, and assure you may be obtained in this way; but you rather choose to die under the force of your inveterate prejudices. It is justly observed by Dr. Whitby here, that if the Jews were justified in supposing that the doctrine of eternal life was contained in the scriptures of the Old Testament, and that they, by searching, might find it there, it must be to them a sufficient rule of faith and practice: but that, if in this they erred, it behooved Christ to correct in them an error so pernicious.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:39-44 The Jews considered that eternal life was revealed to them in their Scriptures, and that they had it, because they had the word of God in their hands. Jesus urged them to search those Scriptures with more diligence and attention. Ye do search the Scriptures, and ye do well to do so. They did indeed search the Scriptures, but it was with a view to their own glory. It is possible for men to be very studious in the letter of the Scriptures, yet to be strangers to its power. Or, Search the Scriptures, and so it was spoken to them in the nature of an appeal. Ye profess to receive and believe the Scripture, let that be the judge. It is spoken to us as advising or commanding all Christians to search the Scriptures. Not only read them, and hear them, but search them; which denotes diligence in examining and studying them. We must search the Scriptures for heaven as our great end; For in them ye think ye have eternal life. We must search the Scriptures for Christ, as the new and living Way, that leads to this end. To this testimony Christ adds reproofs of their unbelief and wickedness; their neglect of him and his doctrine. Also he reproves their want of the love of God. But there is life with Jesus Christ for poor souls. Many who make a great profession of religion, yet show they want the love of God, by their neglect of Christ and contempt of his commandments. It is the love of God in us, the love that is a living, active principle in the heart, which God will accept. They slighted and undervalued Christ, because they admired and overvalued themselves. How can those believe, who make the praise and applause of men their idol! When Christ and his followers are men wondered at, how can those believe, the utmost of whose ambition is to make a fair show in the flesh!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Search the scriptures - The word translated "search" here means to "search diligently" or "search anxiously." It was applied to miners, who search for precious metals - who look anxiously for the "bed" of the ore with an intensity or anxiety proportionate to "their sense" of the value of the metal. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-3.htm">Job 28:3</a>. It is applied by Homer to a lioness robbed of her whelps, and who "searches" the plain to "trace out" the footsteps of the man who has robbed her. It is also applied by him to dogs tracing their game by searching them out by the scent of the foot. It means a diligent, faithful, anxious investigation The word may be either in the indicative or imperative mood. In our translation it is in the imperative, as if Jesus commanded them to search the Scriptures. Cyril, Erasmus, Beza, Bengel, Kuinoel, Tholuck, DeWette, and others, give it as in the indicative: Chrysostom, Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Wetstein, Stier, Alford, and others, regard it as in the imperative, or as a command. It is impossible to determine which is the true interpretation. Either of them makes good sense, and it is proper to use the passage in either signification. There is abundant evidence that the Jews did search the books of the Old Testament. It is equally clear that all people ought to do it.<p>The scriptures - The writings or books of the Old Testament, for those were all the books of revelation that they then possessed.<p>In them ye think ye have eternal life - The meaning of this is: "Ye think that by studying the Scriptures you will obtain eternal life. You suppose that they teach the way to future blessedness, and that by diligently studying them you will attain it." We see by this:<p>1. That the Jews in the time of Jesus were expecting a future state.<p>2. The Scriptures teach the way of life, and it is our duty to study them.<p>The Bereans are commended for searching the Scriptures <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>; and Timothy is said from a child to have "known the holy scriptures, which are able to make us wise unto salvation," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>. Early life is the proper time to search the Bible, for they who seek the Lord early shall find him.<p>They are they ... - They bear witness to the Messiah.

(Compare Ac 17:11, 12). How touching and gracious are these last words! Observe here (1) The honor which Christ gives to the Scriptures, as a record which all have a right and are bound to search&#8212;the reverse of which the Church of Rome teaches; (2) The opposite extreme is, resting in the mere Book without the living Christ, to direct the soul to whom is its main use and chiefest glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Search the Scriptures; </span> the words may be read either imperatively (as our translation readeth them) or indicatively, You do search the Scriptures; that is, of the Old Testament, for the books of the New Testament were not at that time written; but as they had the books of the Old Testament, so they made use of them: Moses was read in the synagogues every sabbath day; and they (the Pharisees especially) were very well versed both in the law and the prophets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For in them ye think ye have eternal life; </span> they did agree that the way of salvation and everlasting life was revealed unto them in the Holy Scriptures; nay, they did judge, that eternal life was to be obtained by their observation of the law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They are they which testify of me:</span> they (saith our Saviour) are my principal testimony; he doth not only say, they testify, but <span class="ital">they are they which testify.</span> No writings but those testify of me; I principally appeal to them to give you an account of me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Search the Scriptures,.... The writings of Moses, and the prophets, which were of divine inspiration and authority, and are often appealed unto by Christ, and his apostles, for the truth of what they delivered; and were the standard of faith, and the test of doctrines; and therefore to be searched diligently into, for finding divine knowledge and improvement in it, and for the trial of doctrines. The words may be rendered in the indicative, as an assertion, "ye do search the Scriptures": the Jews had the sacred oracles committed to them, and these they read, not only their kings, princes, and judges, but the common people, who brought up their children to the reading of them, and instructed them in them: and besides this, these writings were read, and expounded publicly in their synagogues every sabbath day; and at this time especially these records were examined, and particularly those of them which respected the Messiah, since there was now a general expectation of him: and certain it is, that the chief priests, Scribes, and elders, or the sanhedrim, were very much versed in the Scriptures, and could readily refer to those which concerned the Messiah; see an instance of this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm">Matthew 2:4</a>; <p>for in them ye think ye have eternal life; not the doctrine of eternal life, nor the promises of it, nor the way to it; though all these are contained in them, and pointed out by them: for though life and immortality are brought to light by the Gospel, and the promise of eternal life belongs to the covenant of grace, and the way of life and righteousness by Christ is manifested without the law, and not by it; yet there is much of the Gospel, and an exhibition of the covenant of grace, and its promises, and Christ, the way of life, is directed to typically by the tree of life, and the brazen serpent, and other things in those writings. But the meaning here is, that they imagined, by having these writings in their hands, and by their reading them, and hearing them expounded every sabbath day, they should obtain and inherit everlasting life: hence they call (r) the law eternal life, and say (s) concerning the reading of it, that <p>"he that begins to read in the book of the law is obliged to bless after this manner: blessed be he that has chosen us above all nations, and hath given us his law.--And he that finishes blesses after him in this manner: blessed is he who hath given us his law, the law of truth, and has planted "eternal life" in the midst of us.'' <p>This was an opinion of theirs: so the Persic version reads, "for such is your opinion"; and though this was a very vain one, yet it shows what a very high opinion they had of the Scriptures: and now to these our Lord appeals as witnesses for him, and against which they could not object, upon their own principles: <p>and they are they which testify of me; as they do of his proper deity and divine sonship, calling him Jehovah, God, the mighty God, and the Son of God; and of his offices as prophet, priest, and King; and of his incarnation of a virgin; and of the tribe, family, and place of his birth; of the miracles which he should work; of the treatment he should meet with from men; of his sufferings and death; of the circumstances leading on to them, and attending them; as his riding on an ass into Jerusalem, the betraying him by one of his familiar acquaintance, the selling him for thirty pieces of silver, the spitting upon, and scourging him, giving him gall for his meat, and vinegar for his drink, and parting his garments, and casting lots for his vesture, and the crucifixion of him, and that between two thieves; and of his burial, resurrection from the dead, ascension to heaven, and session at the right hand of God, and of his future coming to judgment. <p>(r) Zohar in Gen. fol. 100. 3.((s) Maimon. in Misn.

As far as the Greek shews it may be either, ‘search,’ or ‘ye search,’ and both make sense. The question is, which makes the best sense, and this the context must decide. The context seems to be strongly in favour of the indicative, <span class="bld">ye search</span> <span class="ital">the Scriptures</span>. All the verbs on either side are in the indicative; and more especially the one with which it is so closely connected, ‘and ye will not come.’ <span class="ital">Ye search the Scriptures, and</span> (instead of their leading you to Me) <span class="ital">ye are not willing to come to Me</span>. The tragic tone once more: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a>. The reproach lies not in their searching, but in their searching to so little purpose.

Of the ancients, <span class="ital">Athanasius</span> also recognises it as an Indicative, <span class="ital">Profecti in pagum</span>, T. i., f. 989: and <span class="ital">Nonnus</span>. For which reason Cyril need not have been afraid of being left alone in giving, or being about to give, that explanation. Brentius says, that there are interpreters <span class="ital">of great judgment</span>, who decide for the Indicative: and the whole structure of the discourse certainly confirms it: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-33.htm" title="You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.">John 5:33</a>, etc., and especially that clause, <span class="ital">because ye think</span>. Jesus approves of their search into the Scriptures, which they were not wanting in, inasmuch as at that very feast they read much of them in public; just as He approves of the embassy to John, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-33.htm" title="You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.">John 5:33</a>, and their high estimation of Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.">John 5:45</a>; but He adds, that none of these are enough by themselves. Wherefore this explanation is attended with no loss to the sense: and they are usually, to say the least, equally diligent <span class="ital">searchers of the Scriptures</span>, who decide on the Indicative (which very lately has been adopted by Zeltner and Walchius), as those who decide on the Imperative. This clause, <span class="ital">Ye search and ye will not come</span>, Paul has rendered by synonymous expressions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is on their heart....">2 Corinthians 3:15-16</a>, “Even to this day, <span class="ital">when Moses is read</span>, the veil is upon their heart.

This is grammatical, and corresponds to the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>; but with Cyril, Bengel, De Wette, Meyer, Godet, Lange, Westcott, Plummer, Watkins, we think the whole context demands the indicative. The second clause, "because in them," etc., follows far more obviously upon an assertion than upon a precept. The "ye will not" that follows is far more in harmony with the indicative than with the supposed command. The Lord says, "You have a third great testimony to my claim, and yet you are not prepared to accept it." <span class="accented">Ye search the Scriptures.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) for minute, prolonged search. The kind of investigation which the rabbis spent upon the text and letter of the Holy Scriptures is a proverb, and led to the allegorical mystical meanings of the Genesisaras and other Hebrew literature. "Ye search the Scriptures" rather than the living Word, rather than the Divine meaning and message from the living God which they do contain. This is one term out of many which the Lord employed for the sacred literature which was the great heritage of the Hebrew people. Elsewhere he called it "the Law," "the Law and prophets," "Moses and the prophets," "your Law," "the wisdom of God." He admits their study, prolonged and eager, of the sacred writings, and he justifies the ground and motive of such search, viz.: <span class="cmt_word">because ye think in them ye have eternal life</span>; or, <span class="accented">ye shall have</span>, or <span class="accented">shall find, eternal life.</span> Some powerful critics, like Meyer, urge that our Lord agrees so far with the Jews, that he sympathizes with their search, and that censure or ironical language would be inconsistent with the Saviour's reverence for the Scriptures. But the expression is very unusual on that hypothesis, "Ye think [or, 'imagine'] ye have in them," rather than "ye have through them." Surely our Lord is here condemning the superstitious idea that, in the mere possession of the letter, they were possessors of the eternal life; that, apart from the indwelling Word, apart from the heart of the message itself, some magical advantage was springing. Hillel, whoso view of Scripture may be expressed in a saying ('Aboth,' 2:8), "He who has gotten to himself words of the Law hath gotten to himself the life of the world to come," here differs utterly from the Lord, who, on the doctrine of Holy Scripture, takes ground similar to that which he had taken with reference to the temple and the sabbath. It is not the bare possession of the Scriptures, nor the prolonged examination of its mere letter, that is the condition of eternal life. "Search" which is originated and stimulated by a vague idea of the life-giving force of the letter, is illusive. We may <span class="accented">think</span> that in them we have eternal life, but our Lord would undeceive us. Moreover, from the depths of his own consciousness and knowledge of his own mission, he adds: <span class="cmt_word">And they are they which testify concerning me.</span> This is one of the keynotes of New Testament teaching, viz. Christ's idea of the Old Testament, that it  was a sketch or portraiture drawn in successive ages and on various material of himself - that it was an outline of great principles which he was about, <span class="accented">not</span> to rub out, but to fill in, not "to destroy, but to fulfil." The histories, the experiences, the ceremonial, the dynasties; the offices, the songs and prayers, the predictive and typical sorrows there depicted, were all prelibations and unconscious prophecies of himself. "They testify concerning me," and, together with my works and with my forerunner and, more than all, with my Father's own voice speaking and my Father's own face shining through all, they complete the manifold testimony to the fact that I have come to do his will, to work with him, to deliver, to restore, to give life, and to execute judgment also, when my hour is come.
