God is His Father. There is, therefore, oneness of essence. The unity of His work with God’s work has for its basis the Eternal Love, which showeth to the Son all that the Father doeth. As the relation of Son implies moral inability to do anything apart from the Father, so the relation of Father implies moral necessity to impart all to the Son.<p><span class= "bld">Greater works than these.</span>—The works which He had done could only be explained by the unity of His work with that of the Father; but in the development of His own human nature and His mediatorial work, there will be shown to Him, and He will show to man by doing them in their midst, works of which these are but as the first signs. The “ye” is emphatic, and the word “marvel” should also be noticed. “Ye who seek to kill Me shall yourselves see works which, against your will, shall be wonders to you; but against your will they cannot be signs.

These ancient enemies of Christ understood him, and became more violent, charging him not only with sabbath-breaking, but blasphemy, in calling God his own Father, and making himself equal with God. But all things now, and at the final judgment, are committed to the Son, purposely that all men might honour the Son, as they honour the Father; and every one who does not thus honour the Son, whatever he may think or pretend, does not honour the Father who sent him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Father loveth the Son - This authority he traces to the love which the Father has for him - that special, ineffable, infinite love which God has for his only-begotten Son, feebly and dimly illustrated by the love which an earthly parent has for an only child.<p>Showeth him - Makes him acquainted with.

Father loveth &#8230; and showeth him all, &c.&#8212;As love has no concealments, so it results from the perfect fellowship and mutual endearment of the Father and the Son (see on [1782]Joh 1:1; [1783]Joh 1:18), whose interests are one, even as their nature, that the Father communicates to the Son all His counsels, and what has been thus shown to the Son is by Him executed in His mediatorial character. "With the Father, doing is willing; it is only the Son who acts in Time" [Alford]. Three things here are clear: (1) The personal distinctions in the Godhead. (2) Unity of action among the Persons results from unity of nature. (3) Their oneness of interest is no unconscious or involuntary thing, but a thing of glorious consciousness, will, and love, of which the Persons themselves are the proper Objects.<p>show him greater things, &c.&#8212;referring to what He goes on to mention (Joh 5:21-31), comprised in two great words, Life and Judgment, which Stier beautifully calls God's Regalia.

Though rather the sense is, that greater miracles would be shown, and done by Christ, than these he had now done, in curing a man of his disorder, who had had it eight and thirty years, and bidding him take up his bed and walk; such as raising Jairus's daughter to life, when dead, and the widow of Naim's son, when he was carrying to the grave, and Lazarus, when he had been dead four days: <p>that ye may marvel; this was not properly the end of these greater works shown to, and done by Christ, which were to prove his divine sonship, his proper deity, his true Messiahship, to confirm the faith of his followers in him, and for the glory of God; but this eventually followed upon them: some wondered at them, and believed in him; and others were amazed at them, and confounded by them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-20.htm" title="For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.">John 5:20</a>.

It becomes the recognized phrase by which Christ describes what the world regards as "signs and wonders," "miracles" of power or grace; but it actually connotes the simple activity of God, the normal operation of his hand. Greater manifestations than physical quickening or revival namely, the mighty changes of thought and life, the gifts of grace and peace, eternal life itself, are evermore proceeding.

This was the first effect of Christ's work - Christ's revelation of the Father's heart, Christ's demonstration of the Father's nearness and character. Westcott quotes the apocryphal saying of our Lord preserved by Clement of Alexandria, 'Str.,' 2:9. 45, "He that wonders shall reign, and he that reigns shall rest." The wonders of grace will never be exhausted. New combinations, new transformations, new discoveries, new insight into the eternal love, will be effected by him whom God hath sent, whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world (but see ver. 28). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Loveth (&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;)<p>To love is expressed by two words in the New Testament, &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9; and &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;. &#x391;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9; indicates a reasoning, discriminating attachment, founded in the conviction that its object is worthy of esteem, or entitled to it on account of benefits bestowed. &#x3a6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9; represents a warmer, more instinctive sentiment, more closely allied to feeling, and implying more passion.

Thus &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9; emphasizes the affectional element of love, and &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9; the intelligent element. Socrates, in Xenophon's "Memorabilia," advises his friend Aristarchus to alleviate the necessities of his dependents by furnishing means to set them at work. Aristarchus having acted upon his advice, Xenophon says that the women in his employ loved (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;) him as their protector, while he in turn loved (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;) them because they were of use to him ("Memorabilia," ii., 7, 12). Jesus' sentiment toward Martha and Mary is described by &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-5.htm">John 11:5</a>. Men are bidden to love (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;) God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>); never &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, since love to God implies an intelligent discernment of His attributes and not merely an affectionate sentiment. Both elements are combined in the Father's love for the Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-35.htm">John 3:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a>). &#x391;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; is used throughout the panegyric of love in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1-13</a>, and an examination of that chapter will show how large a part the discriminating element plays in the Apostle's conception of love. The noun &#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; nowhere appears in classical writings. As Trench remarks, it "is a word born within the bosom of revealed religion."'&#x395;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;, in which the idea of sensual passion predominates, is nowhere used in the New Testament. Trench has some interesting remarks on its tendency toward a higher set of associations in the Platonic writings ("Synonyms," p. 42).<p>Greater works will He show Him<p>As Jesus does whatever He sees the Father do (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>), the showing of greater works will be the signal for Jesus to do them. On works, as a characteristic word in John, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-47.htm">John 4:47</a>.<p>Ye may marvel<p>The ye is emphatic (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;) and is addressed to those who questioned His authority, whose wonder would therefore be that of astonishment rather than of admiring faith, but might lead to faith. Plato says, "Wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins in wonder" ("Theaetetus," 105); and Clement of Alexandria, cited by Westcott, "He that wonders shall reign, and he that reigns shall rest."
