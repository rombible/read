The misery believers are made whole from, warns us to sin no more, having felt the smart of sin. This is the voice of every providence, Go, and sin no more. Christ saw it necessary to give this caution; for it is common for people, when sick, to promise much; when newly recovered, to perform only something; but after awhile to forget all. Christ spoke of the wrath to come, which is beyond compare worse than the many hours, nay, weeks and years of pain, some wicked men have to suffer in consequence of their unlawful indulgences.

Instead of making inquiry whether he had not given proof that he was the Messiah, they "assumed" that he must be wrong, and ought to be punished. Thus every bigot and persecutor does in regard to those who differ from them.<p>To slay him - To put him to death. This they attempted to do because it was directed in the law of Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-15.htm">Exodus 31:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-2.htm">Exodus 35:2</a>.

We see here,<p>1. How full of enmity and how bloody was the purpose of the Jews, All that Jesus had done was to restore an infirm man to health - a thing which they would have done for their cattle <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-7.htm">Luke 6:7</a>, and yet they sought. his life because he had done it for a sick "man."<p>2. Men are often extremely envious because good is done by others, especially if it is not done according to the way of their denomination or party.<p>3. Here was an instance of the common feelings of a hypocrite. He often covers his enmity against the power of religion by great zeal for the form of it. He hates and persecutes those who do good, who seek the conversion of sinners, who love revivals of religion and the spread of the gospel, because it is not according to some matter of form which has been established, and on which he supposes the whole safety of the church to hang. There was nothing that Jesus was more opposed to than hypocrisy, and nothing that he set himself more against than those who suppose all goodness to consist in "forms," and all piety in the "shibboleths" of a party. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. because he had done these things on the sabbath day&#8212;What to these hypocritical religionists was the doing of the most glorious and beneficent miracles, compared with the atrocity of doing them on the sabbath day! Having given them this handle, on purpose to raise the first public controversy with them, and thus open a fitting opportunity of laying His claims before them, He rises at once to the whole height of them, in a statement which for grandeur and terseness exceeds almost anything that ever afterwards fell from Him, at least to His enemies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> But the Jews made another use of it, seeking from hence an advantage against him, because he had violated the sabbath, which they often made a capital crime. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus,....

This drew upon him their resentment to such a degree, that they not only persecuted him with their tongues, but sought to take away his life.

This expression is not borrowed from <span class="ital">Philo</span> (Strauss); Jesus alludes to the unresting activity of God for human salvation[205] since the creation was finished, notwithstanding the divine rest of the Sabbath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/2-1.htm" title="Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them....">Genesis 2:1-3</a>) observed after the six days’ work. This distinct reference (not generally “to the sustaining and government of the world”) is presented in the activity of Christ answering to that of God the Father. “As the <span class="ital">Father</span>,” that is, says Jesus, has not ceased from the beginning to work for the world’s salvation, but ever works on even to the present moment,[206] so of necessity and right, notwithstanding the law of the Sabbath, does <span class="ital">He</span> also, <span class="ital">the Son</span>, who as such (by virtue of His essentially divine relationship of equality with the Father) cannot in this His activity be subject to the sabbatical law, but is <span class="ital">Lord</span> of the Sabbath (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-8.htm" title="For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.">Matthew 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-28.htm" title="Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.">Mark 2:28</a>). Olshausen and de Wette import this in the words: “As in God rest and action are united, so in Christ are contemplation and activity.” But there is no mention of rest and contemplation. According to Godet, Jesus says, “<span class="ital">Jusqu’à chaque dernier moment où</span> mon père agit, j’agis aussi;” the Son can only cease His work when He sees the Father cease. But in this case we should have simply <span class="greekheb">ἕως</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>), and not <span class="greekheb">ἕως ἄρτι</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἕως ἄρτι</span> means nothing more nor less than <span class="ital">usque adhuc</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-10.htm" title="And said to him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.">John 2:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-24.htm" title="Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.">John 16:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-9.htm" title="He that said he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now.">1 John 2:9</a>), the <span class="ital">now</span> limiting it still more distinctly than <span class="greekheb">ἕως τοῦ νῦν</span> (Lobeck, <span class="ital">ad Phryn</span>. pp. 19, 20).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ ἐργάζομαι</span>] is not to be again supplemented by <span class="greekheb">ἕως ἄρτι</span>. <span class="ital">I also</span> (do not rest, but) <span class="ital">work</span>. The relation of both sentences is not that of <span class="ital">imitation</span> (Grotius), nor of <span class="ital">example</span> (Ewald), but of <span class="ital">necessary equality</span> of will and procedure. The <span class="ital">asyndeton</span> (instead of “<span class="ital">because</span> my Father,” etc.) makes the statement all the more striking. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-17.htm" title="For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[205] Jesus accordingly does not deny that God rested on the seventh day after the six days of creation (against Ammon); but He affirms that since then He is ever active, even on the Sabbath-days, for man’s redemption. Nor does He speak of the law concerning the Sabbath as not of divine institution (Baur), as of no obligation, or as abrogated; but <span class="ital">He</span> as the <span class="ital">Son</span> stands <span class="ital">above</span> it, and is as little bound by it as the Father, who ever continues to work, even on the Sabbath. This against Hilgenfeld (<span class="ital">Lehrbegriff</span>, p. 81; <span class="ital">Evang</span>. p. 270; and in his <span class="ital">Zeitschrift</span> 1863, p. 218), who considers that, according to this Gospel, Jesus, passing by the O. T. representation of God, rises to the absolutely transcendental essence, exalted above all contact with the finite, and manifest only to the Son; and that the evangelist, following the Gnostics, refers the history of the creation to the Demiurge, as distinct from the most high God. This is not the <span class="ital">“eagle height”</span> of John’s theology.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[206] <span class="greekheb">ἓως ἄρτι</span> carries our view of God’s working, which began with the creation, <span class="ital">onwards to the present moment</span>, the moment wherein Jesus has to defend Himself on account of Sabbath-breaking. In conformity with this redemptive work of God the Father onwards until now, and which was interrupted by no rest, <span class="ital">He</span> also works. The inference that herein is implied a divine <span class="ital">rest</span> at a <span class="ital">future</span> period, as Luthardt thinks,—who regards the day of Christ’s resurrection as the then approaching Sabbath of God’s redemptive work,—is quite remote from the text. <span class="greekheb">Ἕως ἄρτι</span> includes the survey of the entire past down to the moment then present, without any intimation of a change in the future, which, if intended, should appear in the <span class="ital">context</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-24.htm" title="Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.">John 16:24</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-16.htm" title="And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.">John 5:16</a>. The consequence however was that “the Jews persecuted Jesus,” <span class="greekheb">ἐδίωκον</span>, not in the technical sense; but, as the imperfect also suggests, they began from this point to meditate hostile action; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐζήτουν αὐτὸν ἀποκτεῖναι</span>, on the ground that He was a Sabbath-breaker, and therefore worthy of death; <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ταῦτα ἐποίει ἐν σαββάτῳ</span>.

The other two verbs are both in the imperfect tense expressing continued action; ‘used to persecute, continued to persecute;’ ‘used to do, habitually did.’ From which we may infer that some of the unrecorded miracles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-45.htm" title="Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.">John 4:45</a>) were wrought on the Sabbath: unless the Evangelist is speaking from their point of view; ‘because (as they said) He habitually did these things on the Sabbath.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-16.htm" title="And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.">John 5:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐδίωκοι</span>) <span class="ital">they attempted to thrust Him out</span> [began to persecute].—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐξήτουν αὐτὸι ἀποκτεῖναι</span>) More modern copies have inserted this here from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm" title="Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.">John 5:18</a>.[104] <span class="ital">The attempt to kill</span> is opposed to <span class="ital">persecution</span>, properly so called.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[104] BCDL Vulg. and Memph.
