The reference here, as in the whole of this paragraph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21-27</a>), is to the spiritually dead. This is shown by the “now is,” which cannot be applied to the physical resurrection (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-28.htm" title="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,">John 5:28</a>), and cannot be explained by the instances of physical restoration to life during the earthly ministry of our Lord; and also by the last clause, where “live” must mean the higher spiritual life, as it does in the whole context. It is shown too by the parallelism of the clauses with those of the previous verse:—<p>“He that heareth”. . . . “the dead shall hear”<p>“My word”. . . .“the voice of the Son of God,”<p>“Hath eternal life”. . . . “they that hear shall live.” The world is as a vast moral graveyard where men lie dead in sin,—sense-bound hand and foot, with spirits buried in bodies which should be holy temples, but have become as unclean tombs; but the voice of the Son of God speaks, and spirit, love, life, passes through the chambers of death, quickening souls whose death is as yet but a sleep, and those who hear and obey come forth into new life.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:24-29 Our Lord declared his authority and character, as the Messiah. The time was come when the dead should hear his voice, as the Son of God, and live. Our Lord first refers to his raising those who were dead in sin, to newness of life, by the power of the Spirit, and then to his raising the dead in their graves. The office of Judge of all men, can only be exercised by one who has all knowledge, and almighty power. May we believe His testimony; thus our faith and hope will be in God, and we shall not come into condemnation. And may His voice reach the hearts of those dead in sin; that they may do works meet for repentance, and prepare for the solemn day.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The hour - The time.<p>Is coming - Under the preaching of the gospel, as well as in the resurrection of the dead.<p>Now is - It is now taking place. Sinners were converted under his ministry and brought to spiritual life.<p>The dead - Either the dead in sins, or those that are in their graves. The words of the Saviour will apply to either. Language, in the Scriptures, is often so used as to describe two similar events. Thus the destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world are described by Jesus in the same language, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24-25</a>. The return of the Jews from Babylon, and the coming of the Messiah, and the spread of his gospel, are described in the same language by Isaiah, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-61</a>. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>. The renewal of the heart, and the raising of the dead at the judgment, are here also described in similar language, because they so far resemble each other that the same language will apply to both.<p>The voice of the Son of God - The voice is that by which we give command. Jesus raised up the dead by his command, or by his authority. When he did it he spoke, or commanded it to be done. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>; "he took the damsel by the hand, and said, Talitha cumi." <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14</a>; "and he came and touched the bier, and said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise." <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>; "he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth." So it is by his command that those who are dead in sins are quickened or made alive, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>. And so at the day of judgment the dead will be raised by his command or voice, though there is no reason to think that his voice will be audibly heard, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28</a>.<p>Shall live - Shall be restored to life." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25-29.

That which favoureth this sense is, because here is no mention of believing, but only hearing a voice. But the most and best interpreters rather understand these words of those who are dead in trespasses and sins, and the quickening and life mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a></span>, which is called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the first resurrection, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-5.htm" title="But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.

With the same asseveration as before, and for the further illustration and confirmation of the same thing, occasioned by the last clause of the preceding verse, as well as improving upon the argument in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a> for his equality with the Father, which he is still pursuing: <p>the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live; which may be understood either of a corporeal resurrection, and of some particular instances of it, which should shortly be; and of some persons who would be in the state of the dead, and to whom the voice of Christ would be attended with such power as to cause them to hear and live; as did Jairus's daughter upon his saying "Talitha Cumi", damsel arise, and the widow of Naim's son upon his saying, young man arise, and Lazarus, upon his calling to him, Lazarus come forth; and which is a full proof of his being equal to God that quickens the dead: or rather this is to be understood of a spiritual resurrection, and the rather, because this sense best agrees with the foregoing verse; and a corporeal resurrection is expressed in somewhat different words, and seems to be distinguished from this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-28.htm">John 5:28</a>. And besides, the hour, or time of the resurrection of the above particular persons, was not strictly come; nor could they, with propriety, be said to be dead; to which may be added, that the phrase, "they that hear shall live", and none but them, best agrees with this sense: so then by the "dead" are meant such who are dead in trespasses and sins; who are separated from God, alienated from the life of God, and in whom the image of God is defaced; who are dead in all the powers and faculties of their souls, to that which is spiritually good; and are without spiritual breath, sense, feeling, and motion. And by "the voice" of Christ is intended his Gospel, which is a voice of love, grace, and mercy, of life and liberty, of peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation by him; and which being attended with his power, is the means of quickening dead sinners; who may be said to hear it, when it comes not in word only, but in power, and works effectually in them; and is spirit and life, and the power of God unto salvation to them; when they receive it, understand, believe, and obey it: and such persons "shall live"; comfortably, pleasantly, and delightfully, a life of faith on Christ, a life of communion with him, and shall live eternally with him hereafter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span><p>(6) We are all dead in sin and cannot be made alive by any other means, except by the word of Christ apprehended by faith.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-25.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.">John 5:25</a>.

The duration of this <span class="greekheb">ὥρα</span>, however, continues till the second advent; already had it begun to be present, but, viewed in its completeness, it still belonged to the future.

Olshausen, who illogically explains <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-25.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.">John 5:25</a> as referring to the resurrection of the body, appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/27-52.htm" title="And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,...">Matthew 27:52-53</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ νεκροί</span>] the <span class="ital">spiritually</span> dead; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-22.htm" title="But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.">Matthew 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm" title="And to the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things said he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know your works, that you have a name that you live, and are dead.">Revelation 3:1</a>; and see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-21.htm" title="For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.">John 5:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῆς φωνῆς</span>] according to the context, <span class="ital">the resurrection summons</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-28.htm" title="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,">John 5:28</a>), which is here <span class="ital">really</span>, in the connection of the allegory, the morally life-giving <span class="ital">preaching</span> of Christ.

If we understand the words of <span class="ital">bodily</span> awakening, <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀκούσαντες</span> with the article is quite <span class="ital">inexplicable</span>. Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">φωνῆς ἀκούσαντες ἐπιταττούσης</span>; Grotius: “simul atque audierint.” All such renderings, as also the vague explanation of Hengstenberg,[211] would require <span class="greekheb">ἀκούσαντες</span> <span class="ital">merely without</span> the article;[212] and <span class="greekheb">ζήσουσιν</span> would, in opposition to the entire context, signify “<span class="ital">to live</span>” generally, in an indifferent sense.

Not only will the physically dead rise from their bier or their grave in the fulness and strength of resume, life, but the spiritually dead in vast multitudes will pass from death into eternal life, will know that the bitterness of death is over, and that there shall be no more condemnation for them. The Holy Spirit was, when Jesus spake, about to convict the world of sin, and to unveil the glory of Christ to the eye of faith. Pentecost would confirm the word of Jesus, for the Spirit will bear witness to the reality of the risen Lord. But whereas that hour was only "coming," that marvellous day had yet to dawn upon the world, Jesus added it <span class="accented">now</span> <span class="accented">is</span> - while I am speaking the reality of this vast spiritual change is taking place.

"The Son of God," not "a son of man" merely, is uttering his voice. <span class="cmt_word">And they that have heard</span> - accepted the summons, "heard the word," and believed, not merely him that sent me (the teaching of ver. 24), but that he who has been sent is none other than the "Son of God" - these, said Christ, shall live. The form of the expression <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> can only designate those who <span class="accented">give ear</span>, and by this the literal resurrection of all the dead is excluded. The teaching of this verse reasserts the teaching of ver. 24, and adds to it, and clothes the truth in the imagery of the general resurrection. The awful suggestion is involved that many of these dead ones will hear the voice of the Son of God, and not give heed to it. Hengstenberg endeavours to overthrow this  general interpretation of the verse, making it equivalent to vers. 27, 28 rather than an expansion of ver. 24. The "now is," according to him, covers the whole period to the second advent, and the future <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> points to a future epoch in the <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. But the emphatic omission of the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> in the later and more explicit statement is against such a view, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is best explained by its adaptation to the whole clause. "The hour is coming" as well as "now is." The <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> "shall live," rather than shall be "made alive," is far more applicable to the resurrection of dead souls than of defunct bodies. It is equivalent to "have eternal life" of the previous verses. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The dead<p>Spiritually. </body></html>
