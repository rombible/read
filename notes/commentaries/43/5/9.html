What a joyful surprise was this to the poor cripple, to find himself, all of a sudden, so easy, so strong, so able to help himself! What a new world was he in, in an instant! Reader, nothing is too hard for Christ to do! <span class="ital">And took up his bed, and walked </span>— Finding himself whole, he did not object against his Deliverer’s command, though contrary to the precepts of the doctors. He rose up immediately, and, by carrying away his bed with uncommon vigour, showed the greatness and perfection of his cure, not caring who blamed him, or threatened him for doing it. Thus the proof of our spiritual cure is our rising and walking. Hath Christ healed our spiritual diseases? Let us go whithersoever he sends us, and take up and bear whatever he is pleased to lay upon us, and walk before him. <span class="ital">And the same day was the sabbath — </span>That is, Either the first holy convocation in the feast of unleavened bread, that is, the morrow after the passover solemnity, which was one of the greatest sabbaths, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-31.htm" title="The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) sought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.">John 19:31</a>,) or the ordinary sabbath happening on the passover week, and consequently the day on which the disciples plucked the ears of corn, as mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-1.htm" title="At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat....">Matthew 12:1-8</a>. <span class="ital">The Jews </span>— Who saw him pass along the streets in this manner; <span class="ital">said, It is the sabbath day, it is not lawful to carry thy bed </span>— How is it, then, that thou art so presumptuous as to profane this holy day? It does not appear whether they who thus spoke were magistrates, who had power to punish him, or common people, who could only inform against him; but thus far was commendable, that while they knew not by what authority he did it, they were jealous for the honour of the sabbath, and could not, without concern, see it profaned; like <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-17.htm" title="Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this that you do, and profane the sabbath day?">Nehemiah 13:17</a>. <span class="ital">He answered, He that made me whole </span>— He that with a word restored my strength in an instant; <span class="ital">said unto me, Take up thy bed, </span>&c. — As if he had said, I do not do this in contempt of the law and the sabbath, but in obedience to one who, by making me whole, hath given an undeniable proof that he is greater than either. He that could work such a miracle as to heal me in a moment of an inveterate disease, doubtless might give me such a command as to carry my bed; he that could overrule the powers of nature, might doubtless overrule a positive law, especially in an instance not of the essence of the law; he that was so kind as to make me whole, would not be so unkind as to bid me do what was sinful. Christ, by curing another paralytic, proved his power to forgive sins; here to give law: if his pardons are valid, his edicts are so, and his miracles prove both.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-9 We are all by nature impotent folk in spiritual things, blind, halt, and withered; but full provision is made for our cure, if we attend to it. An angel went down, and troubled the water; and what disease soever it was, this water cured it, but only he that first stepped in had benefit. This teaches us to be careful, that we let not a season slip which may never return. The man had lost the use of his limbs thirty-eight years. Shall we, who perhaps for many years have scarcely known what it has been to be a day sick, complain of one wearisome night, when many others, better than we, have scarcely known what it has been to be a day well? Christ singled this one out from the rest. Those long in affliction, may comfort themselves that God keeps account how long. Observe, this man speaks of the unkindness of those about him, without any peevish reflections. As we should be thankful, so we should be patient. Our Lord Jesus cures him, though he neither asked nor thought of it. Arise, and walk. God's command, Turn and live; Make ye a new heart; no more supposes power in us without the grace of God, his distinguishing grace, than this command supposed such power in the impotent man: it was by the power of Christ, and he must have all the glory. What a joyful surprise to the poor cripple, to find himself of a sudden so easy, so strong, so able to help himself! The proof of spiritual cure, is our rising and walking. Has Christ healed our spiritual diseases, let us go wherever he sends us, and take up whatever he lays upon us; and walk before him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Sabbath - To carry burdens on the Sabbath was forbidden in the Old Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-10</a>. If it be asked, then, why Jesus commanded a man to do on the Sabbath what was understood to be a violation of the day, it may be answered,<p>1. That the Son of man was Lord of the Sabbath, and had a right to declare what might be done, and even to dispense with a positive law of the Jews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-8.htm">Matthew 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>.<p>2. This was a poor man, and Jesus directed him to secure his property.<p>3. The Jews extended the obligation of the Sabbath beyond what was intended by the appointment. They observed it superstitiously, and Jesus took every opportunity to convince them of their error, and to restore the day to its proper observance, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-6.htm">Matthew 12:6-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-9.htm">Luke 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-14.htm">Luke 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-5.htm">Luke 14:5</a>. This method he took to show them what the law of God really "permitted" on that day, and that works of necessity and mercy were lawful. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. the same day was the sabbath&#8212;Beyond all doubt this was intentional, as in so many other healings, in order that when opposition arose on this account men might be compelled to listen to His claims and His teaching.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The man’s strength returneth immediately; he is able immediately to arise, take up his bed, and to walk. All this was done on the sabbath day; on which day it was unlawful to carry any burdens, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;">Jeremiah 17:21</a>,24</span>; and by the Jewish canons it was punishable by death, or scourging. But our Saviour had a mind to let the Jews know that he was Lord of the sabbath, and what had been unlawful without his special command, became lawful by it. Neither was this against the sense of the law, though against the letter of it; the law only prohibited civil labour, and carrying burdens for their own profit, and in the way of their trade; it forbade the doing of nothing which was to be done as a public testimony of the goodness and mercy of God showed to persons: and by this our Saviour opens a way for his correction of their erroneous opinions about the true sanctification of the sabbath. We shall observe, that our Saviour used the like phrase to him that had the palsy, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-6.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.">Matthew 9:6</a></span>; and to the centurion’s daughter, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-41.htm" title="And he took the damsel by the hand, and said to her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say to you, arise.">Mark 5:41</a></span>, <span class="ital">Damsel, arise; </span> and to Lazarus, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-43.htm" title="And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.">John 11:43</a></span>, <span class="ital">Lazarus, come forth; </span> which our Saviour did for the testification of the miracle to all that should see them. It is further observed by Heinsius, that our Saviour did many miracles on the sabbath day, because that day was the usual time when the Jews were wont to consult the prophets for help, as may be learned from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-23.htm" title="And he said, Why will you go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath.

As soon as ever the words were spoken by Christ, such power went with them, as restored the man to perfect health; and he finding himself to be quite well, rose up directly: <p>and took up his bed and walked; which may be expressive of a sinner's rising from the bed of sin, and taking up the cross, or carrying the body of sin and death with him; and walking by faith in Christ, as he has received him: <p>and on the same day was the sabbath; which is remarked, for the sake of what follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-9.htm" title="And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.">John 5:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ εὐθέως</span> … Immediately on Christ’s word he became strong, and took up his bed and walked: <span class="greekheb">ἦρε</span> aorist of one act, <span class="greekheb">περιεπάτει</span> imperfect of continued action. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-10.htm" title="The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.">John 5:10</a> should begin with the words <span class="greekheb">ἦν δὲ σάββατον</span>, as this is the starting-point for what follows.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9a.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">immediately</span> <span class="cmt_word">the man became whole</span> (well, sound in health), <span class="cmt_word">and took up his bed, and walked.</span> This act of obedience was an act of faith, as in every other miracle upon paralyzed nerves and frames. The imagery of the sign explains the <span class="accented">rationale</span> of faith. The impotent man, the paralytic, and the man with withered hand, were severally called by Christ to do that which without Divine aid seemed and was impossible. The spiritual quickening of the mind was communicated to the ordinary physical volition, and the bare act was a method by which the palsied sufferer took hold of God's strength. Faith always lays hold thus of power to do the impossible. The words and the result are similar to those adopted on the cure of the paralytic. This is another instance of the identity of the Christ of John and of the synoptists. The various efforts of Strauss, Baur, and Weiss to identify this miracle with that wrought on the paralytic is, however, in defiance of every condition of time, place, character, and consequences. The energy of faith and love which led the Galilaean sufferer to secure the services of four stalwart friends, not only to carry him, but to make strenuous efforts to bring him into the presence of Jesus, contrasts powerfully with the loneliness and friendlessness of the impotent man; and the method adopted by the Lord to convey his grace, and the discussion that followed on that occasion touching the power of the Son of man to forgive sins, all suggest profoundly different circumstances. Nothing but the claim of the critic to be entirely superior to the document he is interpreting can account for so wild a conjecture. </body></html>
