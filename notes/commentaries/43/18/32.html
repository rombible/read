Many fear the scandal of an ill thing, more than the sin of it. Christ had said he should be delivered to the Gentiles, and they should put him to death; hereby that saying was fulfilled. He had said that he should be crucified, lifted up. If the Jews had judged him by their law, he had been stoned; crucifying never was used among the Jews. It is determined concerning us, though not discovered to us, what death we shall die: this should free us from disquiet about that matter.

Neither of these things would have happened if he had been put to death in the way that the Jews first contemplated, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-4.htm">Matthew 26:4</a>. Though it should be admitted that they had the power, in religious cases, to do this, yet in such a case it would not have been done, as Jesus predicted, by the Gentiles; and even if it should be admitted that they had the right to take life, yet they had not the right to do it by crucifixion. This was particularly a Roman punishment. And thus it was ordered, in the providence of God, that the prediction of Jesus in both these respects was fulfilled. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32. That the saying &#8230; might be fulfilled which he spake, signifying what death he should die&#8212;that is, by crucifixion (Joh 12:32, 33; Mt 20:19); which being a Roman mode of execution, could only be carried into effect by order of the governor. (The Jewish mode in such cases as this was by stoning).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Christ had before this time told his disciples that he should die, and that by the death of the cross, as we read, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm" title="And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to whip, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.">Matthew 20:19</a></span>. God by his providence ordereth things accordingly, to let us know that the Scripture might be fulfilled to every tittle. Crucifying was no Jewish but a Roman death; had the Jews put him to death, they would have stoned him; but he must remove the curse from us, by being made <span class="ital">a curse for us, </span> being <span class="ital">hanged on a tree, </span> which was looked upon as an accursed death, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a></span>. The Jews therefore knowing nothing of this counsel of God, yet execute it by refusing themselves to put him to death, and putting it off to Pilate, though possibly their design was but to avoid the odium of it.

This, however, they decline to do, because it is the death penalty they desire, and this they have no right to inflict: <span class="greekheb">ἡμῖν οὐκ ἔξεστιν ἀποκτεῖναι οὐδένα</span>. In the Roman provinces the power of life and death, the <span class="ital">jus gladii</span>, was reserved to the governor. See Arnold’s <span class="ital">Roman Prov. Administration</span>, pp. 55, 57; and Josephus, <span class="ital">Bell.

See also Stapfer’s <span class="ital">Palestine</span>, p. 100. By being thus handed over to the Roman magistrate it came about that Jesus was <span class="ital">crucified</span>, a form of capital punishment which the Jews never inflicted even when they had power; and thus the word of Jesus was fulfilled which He spake intimating that He would die by crucifixion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me....">John 12:32-33</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>. <span class="ital">the saying</span>] Or <span class="ital">word</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.">John 12:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm" title="And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to whip, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.">Matthew 20:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">what death</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">by what</span> manner of <span class="ital">death</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-33.htm" title="This he said, signifying what death he should die.">John 12:33</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-19.htm" title="This spoke he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.

The manner of the death had been foretold by our Lord. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a> he spoke of being lifted up (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a> he charged the Jews with the intention of so lifting him up to die (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), implying a method of capital punishment which was contrary to their ordinary habits; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a> he declared that this lifting up of the Son of man would create part of his sacred and Divine attraction to the human race. In the synoptists he is said to have repeatedly spoken of his <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-27.htm">Luke 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-34.htm">Mark 8:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-38.htm">Matthew 10:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>); but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a> he had clearly predicted his crucifixion by the Gentiles (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22, 23</a>). The manner or kind of death was full of significance; it provided opportunity for the royal demission of his own life; it gave conditions for much of the sublime self-manifestation of the closing hours; it has proved, notwithstanding all the shame and curse of the proceeding, eminently symbolic of the compassion with which he embraced the human race in all its defilement and all the variety of its need. We are not surprised to find that the evangelist saw, in the complicated relations of Jewish and Roman authority, a divinely ordered arrangement, and a clearly foreseen and predicted consummation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a> shows that the charge brought against Jesus was made to receive a coloring likely to prejudice the Roman governor against him: "We found this Man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King." The uproar and the false and malicious charge would be more likely than any other to move Pilate against him; and thus the synoptic narrative, being presupposed, gives an explanation of the first question which John, as well as the synoptists, represents Pilate as first of all pressing upon the Divine Sufferer. Without Luke's statement, Pilate's question is abrupt and in. explicable; but it must be admitted that there is in John's narrative no direct hint of Luke's addition; and Christ's counter-question to the inquiry of Pilate (which last is given in the same form by all four evangelists) implies that he had not overheard the false charge which the Jews had brought into the court. The Lord was within the Praetorium. Pilate and the Jews were on the open, external space, where the altercation proceeded. We may also, with Steinmeyer, observe that nothing could appear more anomalous to Pilate than that these bigoted and rebellious priests, who perpetually resisted the claims of Roman governors to enforce tribute, should now hypocritically pretend that a prophet-leader of their own had been guilty of such a charge. Instead of resisting, the Pharisees would have fostered a demagogue who had taken such a disloyal part. Pilate would at once have suspected that there was something ominous in the very charge itself, when tumultuously pressed by a party who were accustomed to regard such proceedings as patriotic; and he saw with shrewdness that the Jews had merely cloaked their real antagonism by presenting an incrimination which, under ordinary circumstances, they would have treated as a crowning virtue. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>By what death (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>More correctly, by what manner of death.
