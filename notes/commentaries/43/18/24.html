The reading is uncertain; some MSS. read “Therefore;<span class= "ital">”</span> some read “Now;” some omit the word altogether. On the whole, the evidence is in favour of “therefore.” The tense is an aorist, and cannot properly have a pluperfect force. The rendering of the Authorised version is based upon the opinion that Jesus had before been sent to Caiaphas, and that all which followed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a> (see margin there) had taken place after the close of the investigation before Annas.

The particulars have been noticed in the remarks on the other Gospels. The beginning of sin is as the letting forth of water. The sin of lying is a fruitful sin; one lie needs another to support it, and that another. If a call to expose ourselves to danger be clear, we may hope God will enable us to honour him; if it be not, we may fear that God will leave us to shame ourselves. They said nothing concerning the miracles of Jesus, by which he had done so much good, and which proved his doctrine. Thus the enemies of Christ, whilst they quarrel with his truth, wilfully shut their eyes against it. He appeals to those who heard him. The doctrine of Christ may safely appeal to all that know it, and those who judge in truth bear witness to it. Our resentment of injuries must never be passionate.

Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas&#8212;Our translators so render the words, understanding that the foregoing interview took place before Caiaphas; Annas, declining to meddle with the case, having sent Him to Caiaphas at once. But the words here literally are, "Annas sent Him [not 'had sent Him'] to Caiaphas"&#8212;and the "now" being of doubtful authority. Thus read, the verse affords no evidence that He was sent to Caiaphas before the interview just recorded, but implies rather the contrary. We take this interview, then, with some of the ablest interpreters, to be a preliminary and non-official one with Annas, at an hour of the night when Caiaphas' Council could not convene; and one that ought not to be confounded with that solemn one recorded by the other Evangelists, when all were assembled and witnesses called. But the building in which both met with Jesus appears to have been the same, the room only being different, and the court, of course, in that case, one.

This was done before Peter's first denial of Christ; which, it is plain, was in the palace of the high priest, and not in Annas's house; though there seems no reason on this account to place these words at the end of the 13th verse, as they are by some, since they manifestly refer to time past, and do not at all obscure or hinder the true order of the history, as standing here. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/18.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-24.htm" title="Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.">John 18:24</a>.

Zigabenus, Casaubon, Ebrard, Lange, Lichtenstein, Riggenbach, Hengstenberg, Godet). In order, also, to assign the hearing of 19–21 to Caiaphas, some have taken <span class="ital">critical</span> liberties, and placed <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-24.htm" title="Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.">John 18:24</a> after <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-14.htm" title="Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.">John 18:14</a> (so Cyril, who, however, also reads it, consequently, a second time in the present passage, which Beza admits),[215] or have moved it up so as to follow <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a> (a few unimportant critical witnesses, approved by Rinck); some also have employed <span class="ital">exegetical</span> violence. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-24.htm" title="Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.">John 18:24</a>, that is, was regarded either as a <span class="ital">supplemental historical statement in order to prevent misunderstanding;</span> so Erasmus, Castalio, Calvin, Vatablus, Calovius, Cornelius a Lapide, Jansen, and several others, including Lücke, Tholuck, Krabbe, De Wette, Maier, Baeumlein; or the emphasis was laid on <span class="greekheb">δεδεμένον</span>, to which word Grotius ascribed a force explanatory of the following denial, but Bengel one explanatory of the previous maltreatment. These exegetic attempts coincide in this, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΈΣΤΕΙΛΕΝ</span></span></span> is understood in a <span class="ital">pluperfect</span> sense: <span class="ital">miserat</span>, and is regarded as <span class="ital">supplying an omission</span>.[216] The aorist, in order to adduce this as a supplemental addition, would rather be: Annas <span class="ital">sent</span> Him. But when the <span class="ital">Aor</span>. actually stands, making a <span class="ital">supplemental statement</span>, the context itself incontestably shows it (the pluperfect usage of the aorist in <span class="ital">relative</span> clauses, Kühner, II. p. 79; Winer, p. 258 [E. T. p. 343], is not relevant here), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/14-3.htm" title="For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife....">Matthew 14:3-4</a> (not <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-5.htm" title="And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.">Matthew 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-48.htm" title="Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.">Matthew 26:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-27.htm" title="Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, and gathered to him the whole band of soldiers.">Matthew 27:27</a>, nor <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-24.htm" title="And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.">John 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.">John 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-59.htm" title="These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.">John 6:59</a>). Here, however, this is altogether not the case (see rather the progress of the history, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-13.htm" title="And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.">John 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-24.htm" title="Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.">John 18:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-28.htm" title="Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.">John 18:28</a>), and it is only a harmonistic interest which has compelled the interpretation, which is least of all justified in the case of John. John had the pluperfect at command just as much as the aorist, and by the choice of the latter in the sense of the former he would, since the reader has nothing in the context to set him right, have expressed himself so as greatly to mislead, while he would have given, by the whole supplemental observations, the stamp of the greatest clumsiness to his narrative, which had flowed on from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-15.htm" title="And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.">John 18:15</a> down to the present point.

The Sinaitic MS. and some minor authorities insert ‘now’ or ‘but’ (<span class="greekheb">δέ</span>). But an overwhelming amount of evidence, including the Vatican MS., gives S. John’s favourite particle, <span class="bld">therefore</span> (<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>). Moreover the verb is aorist, not pluperfect. <span class="bld">Annas therefore sent Him</span>. It is not necessary to enquire whether the aorist may not virtually be pluperfect in meaning. Even if ‘now’ were genuine and the remark were an after-thought which ought to have preceded <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-19.htm" title="The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.">John 18:19</a></span>, the aorist might still be rendered literally, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-48.htm" title="Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.">Matthew 26:48</a> (‘<span class="ital">gave</span> them,’ not ‘<span class="ital">had given</span> them a sign’).

Because the results of the preliminary investigation before Annas were such (there was a <span class="ital">primâ facie</span> case, but nothing conclusive), ‘Annas <span class="ital">therefore</span> sent Him’ for <span class="ital">formal</span> trial to Caiaphas, who had apparently been present (see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-19.htm" title="The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.">John 18:19</a></span>) during the previous interrogation and had taken part in it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">bound</span>] He had been bound by the Roman soldiers and Jewish officials when He was arrested (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-12.htm" title="Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,">John 18:12</a></span>). This was to prevent escape or rescue. During the examination he would be set free as possibly innocent. After the examination He was bound again as presumably guilty, or as before to prevent escape.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/18.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-24.htm" title="Now Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.">John 18:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀπέστειλεν</span>, <span class="ital">sent</span>) One or two editions supply <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, or <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span>, or <span class="greekheb">τέ</span>. There is no need of doing so.[384] That Jesus had been led by Annas to Caiaphas, had been indicated by John, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-15.htm" title="And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.">John 18:15</a>, by the verb <span class="greekheb">συνεισῆλθε</span>, and by the very appellation <span class="ital">High Priest</span> being so often repeated. But now he takes up again this very circumstance, and records it more expressly in conjunction with the mention of His being <span class="ital">bound</span>, in which state the Saviour [both ingenuously confessed the truth (Harm., p. 536), and] received a most undeserved blow. Sometimes in a narrative there is put something out of the regular order of time, which is connected with those circumstances that receive light from it: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-9.htm" title="And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.">John 5:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-14.htm" title="And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.">John 9:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-30.htm" title="Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.">John 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-22.htm" title="For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was showed.">Acts 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-29.htm" title="And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.">Jeremiah 29:29</a>, compared with what goes before and what follows. It was in one and the same palace of the High Priest, although in different parts of it, that Peter thrice denied Jesus [This explains the connection with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-25.htm" title="And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself.

If John had intended a pluperfect sense to be given to the verb, why not use that tense? The relative clauses, where the aorist is used for the pluperfect, are not relevant here (Meyer). In other cases the context clearly reveals the occasion of such a sense (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-5.htm">Matthew 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-48.htm">Matthew 26:48</a>). John is not unaware of the momentous consequences of this act of Annas, seeing that he refers to them, nor of the fact of the accusation made by the false witnesses, nor of the judicial condemnation which followed Christ's own claim to be the Son of God. The subsequent narrative implies such condemnation (Vers. 29, 30, 35; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>). The author of this narrative does not ignore the fact of the appearance before Caiaphas, nor the issue; but in consequence of the wide diffusion of the synoptic Gospels, he merely called attention to the facts which they had omitted so far as they bore directly on the human character of the Lord. The theological bias with which the evangelist is credited by some would be strangely subserved both by the omission of the scene before Caiaphas, and by the faithful record of this purely human and beautiful trait in the personal character of Jesus. The fact that the fourth evangelist should have recorded facts of which he was eye-witness, and omitted others which would have forcibly sustained his main thesis, is an invincible evidence of historicity. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Annas had sent (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x391;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>The best texts insert &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;, therefore.
