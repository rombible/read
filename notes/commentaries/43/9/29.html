They will not, therefore, accept this Man as a prophet. Their words have tacit reference also to the fact that His works were in their eyes a transgression of the Mosaic law. There is an opposition between them. Both cannot be right, and they will themselves continue to be disciples of Moses. He, it is implied, by confessing Jesus to be a prophet, was practically denying the authority of Moses.<p><span class= "bld">As for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</span>—In our English version the words in italics are added, but they do not express more than the single Greek word, which is used with contempt. Before they had said, “Howbeit we know this Man whence He is; but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence He is” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-27.htm" title="However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.">John 7:27</a>; see Notes on this and the next verse). They here oppose the divine authority of the mission of Moses, which was acknowledged by all, to the absence, as they would say, of any such authority for the work of Jesus. Their words are meant to convey more than they express, coming as they do in sharp contrast with “God spake unto Moses.” They would say again, “This Man is not of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.">John 9:16</a>), “we know that this Man is a sinner” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-24.htm" title="Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.">John 9:24</a>).

In the work of grace in the soul, though we cannot tell when, and how, and by what steps the blessed change was wrought, yet we may take the comfort, if we can say, through grace, Whereas I was blind, now I see. I did live a worldly, sensual life, but, thanks be to God, it is now otherwise with me, Eph 5:8. The unbelief of those who enjoy the means of knowledge and conviction, is indeed marvellous. All who have felt the power and grace of the Lord Jesus, wonder at the wilfulness of others who reject him. He argues strongly against them, not only that Jesus was not a sinner, but that he was of God. We may each of us know by this, whether we are of God or not. What do we? What do we for God? What do we for our souls? What do we more than others?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We know ... - We know that God commanded Moses to deliver the law.

They were blinded through malice and prejudice. Indeed they did know whence he was as to his human nature, for they often made that the cause of their stumbling at him; that he was of Galilee, that his father was a carpenter, and his mother called Mary: but they knew of no Divine mission or authority that he had: this they might have known also, for he did those things which no man ever did, nor could be effected by any thing less than a Divine power; but their eyes were blinded, and their hearts were judicially hardened; they studied to shut out the light by which they should have seen, and would not know whence he was. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>We know that God spoke to Moses,....

They imagined they knew the country from whence he came, which they supposed to be Galilee, and the place where he was born, which they concluded was Nazareth; though in both they were in the wrong; and they knew his parents, Joseph and Mary, and his brethren and sisters; but as to his divine filiation, they knew nothing of it; nor would they own his mission, commission, and credentials to be from heaven; and pretended they had no reason to conclude they were. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-29.htm" title="We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from where he is.">John 9:29</a>.

This is a frequent meaning of the perfect tense—to express the permanent result of a past action. Thus the frequent formula ‘it is written’ is strictly ‘it has been written,’ or ‘it <span class="ital">stands</span> written:’ i.e. it once was written, and the writing still remains. But this is perhaps one of those cases where the Greek perfect is best represented by the English aorist (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-29.htm" title="And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.">John 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-10.htm" title="When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those your accusers? has no man condemned you?">John 8:10</a> for the converse).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we know not from whence he is</span>] We know not what commission He has received, nor who has sent Him.

Once more He is compared with Moses, as in the synagogue at Capernaum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-31.htm" title="Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat....">John 6:31-32</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-29.htm" title="We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from where he is.">John 9:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἡμεῖς οἴδαμεν</span>, <span class="ital">we know</span>) They knew it by such testimonies, as at the present clay also are irrefragable.—<span class="greekheb">πόθεν ἐστίν</span>, <span class="ital">whence He is</span>) as well as His doctrine.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - They pursue the antithesis between Jesus and Moses, and thus make an involuntary admission of his abnormal and astounding claims. We know - it is the fundamental fact of our religions history, and of the Divine revelation entrusted to us. <span class="cmt_word">We know</span>, by supreme conviction, as something almost equivalent to a fundamental law of thought, <span class="cmt_word">that God hath spoken to Moses.</span> (Observe the perfect <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "hath spoken" in such fashion that his words abide fur ever and are still sounding in their ears.) Moses was made a little lower than the angels. God spake to him on Sinai, and from the mercy-scat, and face to face as a man speaketh with his friend (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). The most august ideas and associations clustered round his venerable name. Jesus was supposed to have challenged the supreme authority of Moses, and no sort of comparison could be drawn, in their opinion, between the two. <span class="cmt_word">But  as for this Man, we know not whence he is</span>. It is remarkable that, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27</a>, they had been equally explicit in declaring, "We know whence he <span class="accented">is</span>." Then they thought to discredit iris Messianic claim by drawing a distinction between the well-known parentage and home of Jesus, and the coming of Messiah from some undiscoverable source, some hidden place, where God retained him before his revelation to Israel (see notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-27.htm">John 7:27, 28</a>). While, however, Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>) allowed the validity of their superficial knowledge on that occasion, he declared that he alone knew whence he came and whither he was going (see notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>). It is, perhaps, in reference to this last expression that they echo his own words. The supernatural source of his being and teaching seemed to their minds, throughout that discourse and controversy, to vacillate between the Divine and the demonic. The contrast between Moses and Jesus in this bitter speech runs along the same low level. "We know not whence" he derives his prophetic character, or his right to legislate for the people of God. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Spake (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Perfect tense, hath spoken, and the authority of Moses' words therefore continues to the present.
