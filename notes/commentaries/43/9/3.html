Our version does not give quite accurately the form of the answer. It should be, <span class= "ital">Neither did this man sin, nor his parents.</span> Their question sought to establish a connection between the suffering and some definite act of sin. The answer asserts that no such connection exists, and our Lord’s words remain a warning against the spirit of judging other men’s lives, and tracing in the misfortunes and sorrows which they have to bear the results of individual sin or the proof of divine displeasure. There is a chain connecting the sin of humanity and its woe, but the links are not traceable by the human eye. In the Providence of God vicarious suffering is often the noble lot of the noblest members of our race. No burden of human sorrow was ever so great as that borne by Him who knew no human sin.<p><span class= "bld">But that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span>—They had sought to trace back the result of sin which they saw before them to a definite cause. He will trace it back to the region of the divine counsel, where purpose and result are one. Evil cannot be resolved into a higher good: it is the result of the choice exercised by freedom, and without freedom goodness could not be virtue. Permitted by God, it is yet overruled by Him. It has borne its fearful fruit in the death and curse of humanity, but its works have led to the manifestation of the works of God in the divine plan of redemption. It is so in this instance. The blindness of this beggar will have its result, and therefore in the divine counsel had its purpose, in the light which will dawn upon the spiritual as well as upon the physical blindness, and from him will dawn upon the world.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-7 Christ cured many who were blind by disease or accident; here he cured one born blind. Thus he showed his power to help in the most desperate cases, and the work of his grace upon the souls of sinners, which gives sight to those blind by nature. This poor man could not see Christ, but Christ saw him. And if we know or apprehend anything of Christ, it is because we were first known of him. Christ says of uncommon calamities, that they are not always to be looked on as special punishments of sin; sometimes they are for the glory of God, and to manifest his works. Our life is our day, in which it concerns us to do the work of the day. We must be busy, and not waste day-time; it will be time to rest when our day is done, for it is but a day. The approach of death should quicken us to improve all our opportunities of doing and getting good. What good we have an opportunity to do, we should do quickly. And he that will never do a good work till there is nothing to be objected against, will leave many a good work for ever undone, Ec 11:4. Christ magnified his power, in making a blind man to see, doing that which one would think more likely to make a seeing man blind. Human reason cannot judge of the Lord's methods; he uses means and instruments that men despise. Those that would be healed by Christ must be ruled by him. He came back from the pool wondering and wondered at; he came seeing. This represents the benefits in attending on ordinances of Christ's appointment; souls go weak, and come away strengthened; go doubting, and come away satisfied; go mourning, and come away rejoicing; go blind, and come away seeing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither hath this man sinned ... - That is, his blindness is not the effect of his sin, or that of his parents. Jesus did not, evidently, mean to affirm that he or his parents were without any sin, but that this blindness was not the effect of sin. This answer is to be interpreted by the nature of the question submitted to him. The sense is, "his blindness is not to be traced to any fault of his or of his parents."<p>But that the works of God - This thing has happened that it might appear how great and wonderful are the works of God. By the works of God, here, is evidently intended the miraculous power which God would put forth to heal the man, or rather, perhaps, the whole that happened to him in the course of divine providence first his blindness, as an act of his providence, and then his healing him, as an act of mercy and power. It has all happened, not by the fault of his parents or of himself, but by the wise arrangement of God, that it might be seen in what way calamities come, and in what way God meets and relieves them. And from this we may learn:<p>1. To pity and not to despise and blame those who are afflicted with any natural deformity or calamity. While the Jews regarded it as the effect of sin, they looked upon it without compassion. Jesus tells us that it is not the fault of man, but proceeds from the wise arrangement of God.<p>2. All suffering in the world is not the effect of sin. In this case it is expressly so declared; and there may be many modes of suffering that cannot be traced to any particular transgression. We should be cautious, therefore, in affirming that there can be no calamity in the universe but by transgression.<p>3. We see the wise and wonderful arrangement of Divine Providence. It is a part of his great plan to adapt his mercies to the woes of men: and often calamity, want, poverty, and sickness are permitted, that he may show the provisions of his mercy, that he may teach us to prize his blessings, and that deep-felt gratitude for deliverance may bind us to him.<p>4. Those who are afflicted with blindness, deafness, or any deformity, should be submissive to God. It is his appointment, and is right and best. God does no wrong, and the universe will, when all his works are seen, feel and know that he is just. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Not but that both were guilty of original sin, and had committed actual transgressions; but Christ's answer is to be considered agreeable to the design of the question; and the sense is, that it was not any sin that either of them had committed, whilst he was in the womb, or previous to his birth, that was the cause of this blindness; otherwise, all such irregularities and afflictions arise from sin, and the fall of man, as does that spiritual blindness with which all mankind are attended: <p>but that the works of God should be manifest in him; that is, that Christ might have an opportunity of working a miracle in the cure of him, whereby it might appear that he is truly and properly God, the Son of God, and the Messiah; and so spiritual blindness, which has followed the fall of man, takes place in the elect of God in common with others, that the power of divine grace might be displayed in bringing them out of darkness into marvellous light. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Jesus answered, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</span><p>(a) Christ reasons here as his disciples thought, who presupposed that no diseases came except for the reason of sins: as a result of this he answers that there was another cause of this man's blindness, and that was in order that God's work might be seen.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ παντελῶς ἀναμαρτήτους αὐτούς φησιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὅσον εἰς τὸ τυφλωθῆναι αὐτόν</span>, Euth.

The expression must be left in this general form (it first acquires its more exact force in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>); it denotes the entire <span class="ital">category</span> of which such miraculous healings were a particular <span class="ital">species;</span> hence the works of God were set forth and brought to light in this concrete case, to wit, in the man (<span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>) who experienced the divine miraculous power. In the connection of the divine decree, however, from which everything accidental, everything independent of the divine plan, is excluded, this <span class="greekheb">φανέρωσις</span> must stand in the relation of a <span class="ital">purpose</span> towards the sufferings which, in this particular concrete case, are miraculously removed. Hence <span class="greekheb">ἵνα φανερ</span>., etc., is a thought which contains the true nature of the <span class="ital">Theodicy</span> for all sufferings. According to Weiss, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr</span>. p. 201, the <span class="greekheb">ἔργα θ</span>. are <span class="ital">spiritual</span> operations, namely, the <span class="ital">enlightenment of the world</span>, symbolically set forth by this healing of the blind. This, however, anticipates the doctrinal <span class="ital">application</span> which Jesus Himself makes of the work which He wrought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-39.htm" title="And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.">John 9:39</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a>. Both alternatives are rejected by Jesus, <span class="greekheb">Οὔτε</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>. And another solution is suggested, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> … <span class="greekheb">αυτῷ</span>. Evil furthers the work of God in the world. It is in conquering and abolishing evil He is manifested. The question for us is not where suffering has come from, but what we are to do with it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>. The law which is binding on all men Jesus enounces.—<span class="greekheb">ἐμὲ δεῖ ἐργάζεσθαι</span> … Work, active measures to remove suffering, are more incumbent on men than resentful speculation as to the source of suffering. As to God’s connection with evil, the practical man need only concern himself with this, that God seeks to abolish it. The time for doing so is limited, it is <span class="greekheb">ἕως ἡμέρα ἐστίν</span>, “so long as it is day,” that is as the next clause shows, so long as life lasts. [On <span class="greekheb">ἕως</span> in N.T. see Burton, <span class="ital">Moods</span>, 321–330.]—<span class="greekheb">ἔρχεται νύξ</span>, suggested by the threats (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm" title="Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the middle of them, and so passed by.">John 8:59</a>, etc.) and by the presence of the blind man.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. Christ shews that there is a third alternative, which their question assumes that there is not. Moreover He by implication warns them against assuming a connexion between suffering and sin in individuals (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-14.htm" title="Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to you.">John 5:14</a>). <span class="ital">Neither</span> <span class="bld">did</span> <span class="ital">this man</span> <span class="bld">sin</span> (not ‘hath sinned’), <span class="ital">nor his parents</span>. The answer, like the question, points to a definite act of sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">but that</span>] i.e. he was born blind <span class="ital">in order that</span>. This elliptical use of ‘but (in order) that’ is common in S. John, and illustrates his fondness for the construction expressing a purpose: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-8.htm" title="He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.">John 1:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-56.htm" title="Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.">John 8:56</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the works of God</span>] All those in which He manifests Himself, not miracles only.
