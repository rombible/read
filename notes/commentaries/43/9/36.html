He recognises Him by the voice which he had heard before, and now for the first time sees Him. He is ready to believe on the Messiah whom all expected, and he feels that this prophet, who had opened his eyes, can tell him who the Messiah is. The form of the question, “Who is He?” suggests that he half expected that He, upon whom he looked, was more than a prophet, and was none other than the Messiah Himself. In the absence of any such thought, the question would have taken a vague form, such as “Where is He?” or “When shall He appear?” He asks as one who knows that the object of his faith is at hand.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:35-38 Christ owns those who own him and his truth and ways. There is particular notice taken of such a suffer in the cause of Christ, and for the testimony of a good conscience. Our Lord Jesus graciously reveals himself to the man. Now he was made sensible what an unspeakable mercy it was, to be cured of his blindness, that he might see the Son of God. None but God is to be worshipped; so that in worshipping Jesus, he owned him to be God. All who believe in him, will worship him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is he? - It is probable that the man did not know that he who now addressed him was the same who had healed him. He had not yet seen him <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-7.htm">John 9:7</a>, but he was prepared to acknowledge him when he did see him. He inquired, therefore, who the person was, or wished that he might be pointed out to him, that he might see him. This passage shows that he was disposed to believe, and had a strong desire to see and hear the Son of God.<p>Lord - This word here, as in many other instances in the New Testament, means "Sir." It is clear that the man did not know that it was the Lord Jesus that addressed him, and he therefore replied to him in the common language of respect, and asked him to point out to him the Son of God. The word translated "Lord" here is rendered "Sir" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-11.htm">John 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-21.htm">John 12:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-30.htm">Acts 16:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a>.

Our Lord had prepared this poor man’s heart for the receiving of him; there wanted now nothing but the due revelation of the Messiah unto him. This our Saviour giveth him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He answered and said,.... That is, "he that was healed", as the Syriac version reads: <p>who is the Lord that I might believe in him? which shows, that though he knew there was a Messiah expected, and he believed in him as to come, yet he knew not that he was already come, nor the particular person in human nature, who was the Messiah, and the Son of God; even though he had been cured of his blindness by him, and had vindicated him, and pleaded for him before the sanhedrim, and had also suffered for him; which makes it appear, that Christ does many and great things for his people before they know him: nor does their interest in him, in his favour, and in the blessings of his grace, depend upon their knowledge of him, and faith in him; as likewise, that a man may plead for Christ, and suffer much for him, and yet be ignorant of him: however, there were in this man desires of knowing Christ; he was not like those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-14.htm">Job 21:14</a>; and there was a readiness in him to believe on him, as soon as he was pointed out to him; not that there is any natural disposition in men to believe, or any readiness in themselves to it, or that it is of themselves; nothing of this nature was in this man; but he having, by the power and grace of Christ, the principle of faith implanted in his heart, what he wanted was to be directed to the proper object of it, as he is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-37.htm">John 9:37</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-36.htm" title="He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?">John 9:36</a>. The man’s answer shows that he was willing to believe in the Messiah if he could identify Him; and having already declared Jesus to be a prophet, he believed that He could tell him who the Messiah was. It may be taken for granted that although he had not seen Jesus since recovering his sight, he knew somehow that he was speaking to the person who had healed him; and was perhaps almost prepared for the great announcement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-37.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he that talks with you.">John 9:37</a>): <span class="greekheb">Καὶ ἑώρακας αὐτὸυ</span>, “Thou hast both seen Him,” no doubt: with a reference to the blessing of restored eyesight; <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐστιν</span>. This direct revelation, similar to that given to the Samaritan woman (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-26.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I that speak to you am he.">John 4:26</a>), was elicited by the pitiable condition of the man as an outcast from the Jewish community, and by the perception that the man was ripe for faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">36</span>. <span class="ital">Who is he, Lord</span>] We should perhaps insert ‘and’ or ‘then’ with some of the best MSS., <span class="bld">and</span> <span class="ital">Who is He?</span> or, <span class="ital">Who is He</span> <span class="bld">then?</span> This ‘and’ or ‘then’ has the effect of intensifying the question.

The disposition, the posture, of his mind is that of faith. The adequate object for that faith has not been revealed to him. Apt symbol of many in their passage from darkness to light. When receptive, susceptible, conscious of need, with some notion, though an obscure one, of whom and of what they most of all need, many are disposed even now to utter the same importunate request. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Who is He?<p>The best texts insert &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;, and; and who is he? which imparts an air of eagerness to the question. </body></html>
