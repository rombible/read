If they were among those “which see not” they would be conscious of their blindness, and would seek for spiritual light. They would ask, “Who is He, Lord, that we may believe on Him?” and would not ask in vain. In that case their present rejection of Him would arise from ignorance willing to be overcome, and this ignorance, not being wilful, would not be sin. Conscious ignorance would be the first step towards knowledge.<p><span class= "bld">But now ye say, We see.</span>—Their true place is among those who were spiritually blind, and were unconscious of it, “they which see,” they which think they see.” For them the first step towards true spiritual light must be a consciousness of blindness. As it is, as long as they think that they see, there is no ground for hope.

They stand side by side with “Ye say, We see.” The two states are one. The assertion of spiritual knowledge and independence was the original cause of sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-4.htm" title="And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die:">Genesis 3:4</a>), and while spiritual pride exists sin cannot cease.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:39-41 Christ came into the world to give sight to those who were spiritually blind. Also, that those who see might be made blind; that those who have a high conceit of their own wisdom, might be sealed up in ignorance. The preaching of the cross was thought to be folly by such as by carnal wisdom knew not God. Nothing fortifies men's corrupt hearts against the convictions of the word, more than the high opinion which others have of them; as if all that gained applause with men, must obtain acceptance with God. Christ silenced them. But the sin of the self-conceited and self-confident remains; they reject the gospel of grace, therefore the guilt of their sin remains unpardoned, and the power of their sin remains unbroken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If ye were blind - If you were really blind had had no opportunities of learning the truth. If you were truly ignorant, and were willing to confess it, and to come to me for instruction.<p>No sin - You would not be guilty. Sin is measured by the capacities or ability of people, and by their opportunities of knowing the truth. If people had no ability to do the will of God, they could incur no blame. If they have all proper ability, and no disposition, God holds them to be guilty. This passage teaches conclusively:<p>1. that people are not condemned for what they cannot do.<p>2. that the reason why they are condemned is that they are not disposed to receive the truth.<p>3. that pride and self-confidence are the sources of condemnation.<p>4. that if people are condemned, they, and not God, will be to blame.<p>We see - We have knowledge of the law of God. This they had pretended when they professed to understand the law respecting the Sabbath better than Jesus, and had condemned him for healing on that day.<p>Your sin remaineth - You are guilty, and your sin is unpardoned. People's sins will always be unpardoned while they are proud, and self-sufficient, and confident of their own wisdom.

They were indeed blind, as to any true and saving sight of Christ, and of the true way of salvation by believing in him; seeing (as they apprehended) a way of salvation without Christ, by the works of the law, and wilfully shutting their eyes against the glorious light of the gospel shining on them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ye should have no sin; </span> you should not have so much sin, so much guilt upon your souls, as you now have: though your ignorance had been sin, yet it had not been so great a sin as a wilful shutting your eyes against the light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">But now ye say, We see; </span> now that you have an opinion that you see, and boast in your knowledge of the law, as if you were the only men that saw; and upon this presumption reject the doctrine of salvation; <span class="ital">therefore your sin remaineth, </span> by it you not only conclude yourselves under the guilt of sin, but your sin remaineth upon you, not pardoned to you: which teacheth us, that without a true and saving sight of sin, and such a one as carrieth the soul out of itself to Christ for pardon and remedy, there is no hope of pardon and forgiveness from all the mercy that is in God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus said unto them, if ye were blind,.... And sensible of it, and knew yourselves to be blind, and were desirous of light and knowledge, <p>ye would have no sin: or your sin would not be so aggravated; it would not be imputed to you; it would be pardoned and taken away from you: for the sense cannot be, that their blindness would not have been criminal, or they should have no sin in them, or any done by them; only, that had this been barely their case, there would have been some hope of them, that their sin might be forgiven, and put away, and be no more; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>; <p>but now ye say we see; they thought themselves to be wise and knowing, and stood in no need of any illumination from him, but were obstinate and hardened in their infidelity, and wilfully opposed and shut their eyes against all the light and evidence of truth: <p>therefore your sin remaineth; untaken away, yea, immoveable, or unpardonable; the guilt of it abode upon them; nor was there any hope of its being removed from them; owning that they saw, and yet believed not: sinning wilfully against light and knowledge in rejecting Jesus, as the Messiah, they sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost, which is never forgiven.

According to Lücke (so also substantially Baeumlein), whom J. Müller follows (<span class="ital">Lehre v. d. Sünde</span>, I. p. 286, ed. 5), the meaning is: “Were you blind, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. without the <span class="ital">capability</span> of knowledge, there would be no sin (guilt) in your unbelief; you would then be <span class="ital">unable</span> to believe with knowledge. But so long as you say, notwithstanding all your blindness, We see, and therefore do not put away your conceited self-deception, so long your unbelief cannot depart, but must remain.” Against this view are the following objections: 1. <span class="greekheb">Τυφλοί</span>, because answering to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΒΛΈΠΟΝΤΕς</span></span></span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-39.htm" title="And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.">John 9:39</a>, cannot denote <span class="ital">incapacity</span> for knowledge; 2. The antithesis <span class="greekheb">λέγετε ὅτι βλέπ</span>. suggests for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΥΦΛΟΊ</span></span></span>, not the objective, but the subjective meaning; 3. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑ</span></span></span> is thus taken in different senses in the two halves. Other imported meanings are: <span class="ital">Were you blind</span>, like the <span class="ital">multitude</span> which you regard as blind, <span class="ital">perhaps</span> you would have no sin, etc. (Ewald, as though besides <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span> John had written also <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΆΧΑ</span></span></span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἼΣΩς</span></span></span>); or (Hengstenberg), if ye suffered merely from the simple blindness of the human race, which is blind from birth, ye would have no sin of decisive significance, no unpardonable sin; as though there were the slightest reference to anything of the kind!

They rejected Him because they did not know the truth about Him; and they would never learn the truth because they were fully persuaded that they were in possession of it.
