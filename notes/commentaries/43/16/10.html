That representation of Christ brings also the conviction of righteousness, but this is the righteousness of Christ, not that of the world. The conviction of Christ’s righteousness necessarily precedes that of the heart’s own sin. The light makes the darkness visible, and the revelation of the darkness shows the clearness of the light. The special reason of the conviction of righteousness is the resurrection and ascension of our Lord. Men had called Him a sinner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-24.htm" title="Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.">John 9:24</a>), and His crucifixion was the world’s assertion that He was a malefactor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-30.htm" title="They answered and said to him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up to you.">John 18:30</a>); but even when He was hanging upon the cross there came to the centurion’s mind the conviction, “Truly this Man was innocent” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-47.htm" title="Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.">Luke 23:47</a>); and moreover His return to the Father was Heaven’s witness to His righteousness. For the way in which this conviction was brought home to the hearts of the Apostles, and through them to the hearts of mankind, comp. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm" title="Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-31.htm" title="He seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.">Acts 2:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-36.htm" title="Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made the same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ.">Acts 2:36-37</a>. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm" title="But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-52.htm" title="Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:">Acts 7:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm" title="For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:">1Peter 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:">1John 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-29.htm" title="If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one that does righteousness is born of him.">1John 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm" title="Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.">1John 3:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">And ye see me no more.</span>—The word means, “look upon,” “behold.” The going to the Father would cause that they should gaze upon His bodily presence no more; but the Spirit’s witness of Him, which would convince the world of sin and righteousness, would be, to them a truer presence of their Lord than any which physical eye could see. The eye of the spirit sees the reality; the eye of the body only looks upon the appearance.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:7-15 Christ's departure was necessary to the Comforter's coming. Sending the Spirit was to be the fruit of Christ's death, which was his going away. His bodily presence could be only in one place at one time, but his Spirit is every where, in all places, at all times, wherever two or three are gathered together in his name. See here the office of the Spirit, first to reprove, or to convince. Convincing work is the Spirit's work; he can do it effectually, and none but he. It is the method the Holy Spirit takes, first to convince, and then to comfort. The Spirit shall convince the world, of sin; not merely tell them of it. The Spirit convinces of the fact of sin; of the fault of sin; of the folly of sin; of the filth of sin, that by it we are become hateful to God; of the fountain of sin, the corrupt nature; and lastly, of the fruit of sin, that the end thereof is death. The Holy Spirit proves that all the world is guilty before God. He convinces the world of righteousness; that Jesus of Nazareth was Christ the righteous. Also, of Christ's righteousness, imparted to us for justification and salvation. He will show them where it is to be had, and how they may be accepted as righteous in God's sight. Christ's ascension proves the ransom was accepted, and the righteousness finished, through which believers were to be justified. Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. All will be well, when his power is broken, who made all the mischief. As Satan is subdued by Christ, this gives us confidence, for no other power can stand before him. And of the day of judgment. The coming of the Spirit would be of unspeakable advantage to the disciples. The Holy Spirit is our Guide, not only to show us the way, but to go with us by continued aids and influences. To be led into a truth is more than barely to know it; it is not only to have the notion of it in our heads, but the relish, and savour, and power of it in our hearts. He shall teach all truth, and keep back nothing profitable, for he will show things to come. All the gifts and graces of the Spirit, all the preaching, and all the writing of the apostles, under the influence of the Spirit, all the tongues, and miracles, were to glorify Christ. It behoves every one to ask, whether the Holy Spirit has begun a good work in his heart? Without clear discovery of our guilt and danger, we never shall understand the value of Christ's salvation; but when brought to know ourselves aright, we begin to see the value of the Redeemer. We should have fuller views of the Redeemer, and more lively affections to him, if we more prayed for, and depended on the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of righteousness - This seems clearly to refer to the righteousness or innocence of Jesus himself. He was now persecuted. He was soon to be arraigned on heavy charges, and condemned by the highest authority of the nation as guilty. Yet, though condemned, he says that the Holy Spirit would descend and convince the world that he was innocent.<p>Because I go to my Father - That is, the amazing miracle of his resurrection and ascension to God would be a demonstration of his innocence that would satisfy the Jews and Gentiles. God would not raise up an impostor. If he had been truly guilty, as the Jews who condemned him pretended, God would not have set his seal to the imposture by raising him from the dead; but when he did raise him up and exalt him to his own right hand, he gave his attestation to his innocence; he showed that he approved his work, and gave evidence conclusive that Jesus was sent from God. To this proof of the innocence of Jesus the apostles often refer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>. This same proof of the innocence or righteousness of the Savior is as satisfactory now as it was then. One of the deepest feelings which an awakened sinner has, is his conviction of the righteousness of Jesus Christ. He sees that he is holy; that his own opposition to him has been unprovoked, unjust, and base; and it is this which so often overwhelms his soul with the conviction of his own unworthiness, and with earnest desires to obtain a better righteousness than his own.<p>And ye see me no more - That is, he was to be taken away from them, and they would not see him until his return to judgment; yet this source of grief to them would be the means of establishing his religion and greatly blessing others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more&#8212;Beyond doubt, it is Christ's personal righteousness which the Spirit was to bring home to the sinner's heart. The evidence of this was to lie in the great historical fact, that He had "gone to His Father and was no more visible to men":&#8212;for if His claim to be the Son of God, the Saviour of the world, had been a lie, how should the Father, who is "a jealous God," have raised such a blasphemer from the dead and exalted him to His right hand? But if He was the "Faithful and True Witness," the Father's "Righteous Servant," "His Elect, in whom His soul delighted," then was His departure to the Father, and consequent disappearance from the view of men, but the fitting consummation, the august reward, of all that He did here below, the seal of His mission, the glorification of the testimony which He bore on earth, by the reception of its Bearer to the Father's bosom. This triumphant vindication of Christ's rectitude is to us divine evidence, bright as heaven, that He is indeed the Saviour of the world, God's Righteous Servant to justify many, because He bare their iniquities (Isa 53:11). Thus the Spirit, in this clause, is seen convincing men that there is in Christ perfect relief under the sense of sin of which He had before convinced them; and so far from mourning over His absence from us, as an irreparable loss, we learn to glory in it, as the evidence of His perfect acceptance on our behalf, exclaiming with one who understood this point, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died; yea, rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God," &c. (Ro 8:33, 34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A second thing of which the Spirit is promised to convince the world, is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">righteousness, </span> by which all interpreters agree is meant the righteousness of Christ. Only some would have it to be understood of Christ’s personal righteousness, which is inherent in him; upon which account he is called <span class="ital">the just One, </span> the <span class="ital">righteous One, </span>& c. Then the sense is this: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Jews now say I have a devil, and cast out devils by Beelzebub; they accuse me as an impostor and seducer, call me a friend of publicans and sinners; but when the Holy Spirit which I will send shall come, he shall convince the world that I was a just and righteous person, and not such a one as they have vilely represented me: which was fulfilled in a great measure, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place....">Acts 2:1-3</a>:26</span>, when so many were converted and joined to the church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the best interpreters understand it of that righteousness of Christ which is communicated to men in justification, of which so much is spoken in holy writ, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm" title="He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.">Isaiah 53:11</a> 56:1 <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.">Daniel 9:24</a></span>; and in many other texts: so as the Spirit is here promised as instructing the world in that true righteousness by which a soul can be justified; and therein both correcting the errors of the pagan world, who thought the light of nature enough to show them the way to heaven; and also of the Jewish world, who thought the righteousness of the law sufficient; by showing them, that no righteousness would do it but the righteousness of Christ, reckoned unto them for righteousness, and apprehended by faith. Christ’s going to his Father, did both evidence him to be a just and righteous person, however wicked men in the world had represented and traduced him, for his Father would not have received him if he had not been such a person; and also evidence that, as was prophesied of the Messias, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm" title="Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.">Daniel 9:24</a></span>, he had finished <span class="ital">the transgression, </span> made <span class="ital">an end of sin, </span> made <span class="ital">reconciliation for iniquity, </span> and brought in <span class="ital">everlasting righteousness:</span> for it could not be imagined, that he should have an access to his Father before he had finished the work which his Father had given him to do, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-4.htm" title="I have glorified you on the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do.">John 17:4</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And</span> (saith our Saviour) <span class="bld">ye see me no more; </span> that is, after my ascension you shall see me no more; or after my death you shall see me no more, to have any such ordinary converse with me as hitherto you have had: for I shall not ascend to return again to you; but to sit at the right hand of my Father, till I return again to the last judgement. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Of righteousness, because I go to my Father,.... The "righteousness" here spoken of, does, in the first sense of the word, design the personal righteousness of Christ. The Jews had traduced him as a wicked man, said he was a sinner himself, and a friend of publicans and sinners; that he was guilty of blasphemy and sedition, maintained a familiarity with Satan, yea, that he had a devil: now the Spirit of God, by the mouth of Peter, on the day of "Pentecost", proved, to the conviction of the Jews, that all this was slander; that Christ was an innocent, holy, and righteous person, and a man approved of God among them, as they themselves must be conscious of, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>; of all which, his going to the Father, and being received by him, were a full proof and demonstration. The effusion of the Spirit in that extraordinary manner upon the disciples, showed that he was gone to the Father, and had received from him the promise of the Holy Ghost, which he then shed abroad; and his going to the Father, and being set down by him at his right hand, made it clear that he came from him, and was no impostor; that he had acted the faithful and upright part, and was free from all the charges the Jews had laid against, him. Moreover, this may also be very well understood of the mediatorial righteousness of Christ, which he, as the surety and Saviour of his people, was to work out and bring in for them, in obedience to the law of God; which required holiness of nature, perfection of obedience, and bearing its penalty, death; all which were complied with by Christ, and so the whole righteousness of the law was fulfilled by him; and which is imputed by God as the justifying righteousness of all that believe in Jesus; and the proof of his having wrought out this, lies in his going to the Father; for as this was the work he came about, the will of his Father he came to do, had he not done it, it is reasonable to think he would never have met with such a welcome from him: besides, the donation of the Spirit, in consequence of its being wrought out, most clearly demonstrates it: likewise in the ordinary work of the Spirit of God upon the souls of his people, he always convinces them of the necessity of a righteousness to justify them before God, to render them acceptable in his sight, and to give them a right to the heavenly glory; for to admit them without a righteousness, or any unrighteous persons there, would be contrary to the justice of God, disagreeable to his pure and holy nature, and destructive of the comfort and happiness of the saints. He, the Spirit of God, convinces men of the insufficiency of their own righteousness for such purposes; that they have no righteousness that deserves the name of one, and that what they have will not justify them before God, and entitle them to heaven: and this he does, by showing them the corruption of their nature, their daily sins and infirmities, in thought, word, and deed; the purity of the divine perfections, and the spirituality and extensiveness of the law of God; which when a man is thoroughly apprized of, he can never hope for and expect justification before God by his own righteousness: hence the Spirit of God proceeds to convince men of the glory, excellency, fulness, and suitableness of the righteousness of Christ; which he does, by revealing it to them in the Gospel, setting it before them, and working faith in them to lay hold upon it; when they desire to be found in Christ, not having on their own, but his righteousness; which convictions appear by the mean thoughts they have of their own righteousness, by hungering after Christ's, by disclaiming all but his, by their constant mention of it, dependence on it, and satisfaction in it; and thus to convince of it, is the peculiar work of the Spirit, since naturally men are fond of their own righteousness, are ignorant of Christ's, and set against it. It is added, <p>and ye see me no more; not but that the disciples were to see Christ, and did see him after his resurrection, and will with the rest of the saints see him at his second coming: but the meaning is, that they should see him no more, in a mean and despicable condition on earth, in a state of humiliation, in the form of a servant, he having faithfully performed the whole work he came about, and particularly that of righteousness, he came to bring in. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Of <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;</span><p>(c) Of Christ himself: for when the world will see that I have poured out the Holy Spirit they will be forced to confess that I was just, and was not condemned by my Father when I went out of this world.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-10.htm" title="Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and you see me no more;">John 16:10</a>. The second particular: <span class="ital">in reference to righteousness</span>, accordingly to the opposite of <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span>. As, however, in <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας</span> the subject is the <span class="ital">world itself</span>, the <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγξις</span> of which is described, so the subject of <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> is <span class="ital">Christ;</span> hence the more exact definition: <span class="ital">so far as I, namely, go to my Father, and you see me no more;</span> <span class="greekheb">δικαίου γὰρ γνώρισμα τὸ πορεύεσθαι πρὸς τὸν θεὸν κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συνεῖναι αὐτῷ</span>, Euth.

So substantially Chrysostom and his successors, Beza, Maldonatus, Bengel, Morus, Tittmann, and several others, including Lücke, Klee, Olshausen, De Wette, B. Crusius, Maier, Godet, Baeumlein. Since, according to the analogy of the remaining parts, <span class="ital">Christ</span> must be the subject of <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>, then already on this ground we must reject not only the interpretation of Grotius of the compensatory <span class="ital">justice of God</span>,[173] and that of the Socinians and Kuinoel, <span class="ital">quod jus et fas est</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-15.htm" title="But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from there: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;">Matthew 12:15</a>), but also that of Augustine, Erasmus, Luther,[174] Melanchthon, Calvin, Calovius, Jansen, Lampe, Storr, Hengstenberg, and several others, that the <span class="ital">righteousness of man through faith</span> in the Pauline sense is intended,[175] which also De Wette (with the modification that it is its victorious power in the world which is spoken of) inappropriately mixes up with the other interpretation. The form which Luthardt gives to the interpretation of Augustine, etc., that the passage does not indeed express that Christ has by means of His departure <span class="ital">acquired</span> righteousness, but rather that He has <span class="ital">rendered</span> righteousness <span class="ital">possible</span>, because faith in Himself as invisible, is likewise opposed by the fact that Christ would not be the subject to which <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> was ascribed; and it contains, moreover, too artificial a reflection, which is not even appropriate, since faith in Christ cannot be conditioned by His invisibility, although faith must exist in spite of the invisibility of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-29.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.">John 20:29</a>). The thought is rather: “The fact that I go to the Father, and that I shall then be removed from your eyes, will serve to the Spirit in His <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγξις</span> of the world as a demonstration of the fact that I am <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>.”[176] And thus the by no means idle, but tender and sympathetic expression, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐκέτι δεωρεῖτέ με</span>, as denoting the translation into the invisible world, is an outflow of the thoughtful and feeling <span class="ital">interest</span> of Jesus in the approaching <span class="ital">pain of separation which the disciples</span> were to experience, to whom this grief, in view of the higher object of that <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγξις</span> of the world, could not be spared. A reference to the <span class="ital">scorn of the world</span> to be expected on the removal of Jesus, as if He were thereby to be manifested an impostor (Linder, in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1867, p. 514 ff.), is remote from the connection. De Wette’s remark is incorrect: that <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς θεωρεῖτέ με</span> was rather to be expected. <span class="ital">That</span> must have been expected if, with Tholuck, it had to be explained of the <span class="ital">moral purity</span> (= <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span>) only to be found in Christ, the revelation of which was completed by the spiritual communication of the exalted One, who now may be contemplated <span class="ital">spiritually</span> instead of bodily. But thus all essential points would have been read between the lines.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[173] “Deum aequum esse rectorem, ut qui me extra omnem injuriae contactum in suae majestatis consortium receperit.” Comp. also Ewald, <span class="ital">Jahrb.</span> VIII. p. 199, and <span class="ital">Johann.

This interpretation is incorrect, for the reason that, in accordance with it, the <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγξις περὶ δικαιοσύνης</span> would substantially coincide with the <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγξις περὶ ἁμαρτίας</span>.

Righteousness is the keeping of the law, and is the natural result of faith; so much so that faith is reckoned as if it were righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/4-3.htm" title="For what said the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness....">Romans 4:3-9</a>), so certain is this result regarded. Here ‘righteousness’ is used not in the lower sense of keeping prescribed ordinances (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-15.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered him.">Matthew 3:15</a>), but in the highest and widest sense of keeping the law of God; internal as well as external obedience. The lower sense was almost the only sense both to Jew and Gentile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-20.htm" title="For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:20</a>). The Spirit, having convinced man that sin is much more than a breaking of certain ordinances, viz. a rejection of God and His Christ, goes on to convince him that righteousness is much more than a keeping of certain ordinances.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I go to my Father</span>] Better, <span class="ital">I go</span> <span class="bld">away</span> (see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7</a></span>) <span class="ital">to</span> <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">Father</span>; ‘My’ is wanting in the best texts. Once more ‘because’ explains ‘will convict,’ not ‘righteousness.’ The life of Christ on earth as the pattern for all mankind being completed, and the reconciliation of man to God being completed also, the Spirit makes known to man the nature of that life, and thus shews what the nature of righteousness is.

And the sight of His glory, which accompanied His righteousness (“His justification in the Spirit”), would be intolerable to those living in the flesh.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In respect of righteousness, because I go to the Father,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and ye behold me no more</span>. Not merely that the world will be led to form a new conception of righteousness, seeing that God has exalted him whom they have condemned as a malefactor, - that would really, with Lucke and Meyer, limit this "righteousness" to a judgment concerning the guiltlessness of Christ; nor can we, with Luther, etc., regard it as equivalent to the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>, the righteous attribute and righteous process by which God is able to treat as righteous those who believe. This is the only place in the Gospel where the word occurs, and it can scarcely bear the technical significance of the great theological discussions with which it was afterwards associated. Schaff has called attention to the Vulgate translation <span class="accented">justitia</span>, which is represented in the Rheims English Version by "justice," and reminds us how Archdeacon Hare urges that "righteousness" and "justice" correspond to the entire theology of the Protestant and Romanist Churches. The Protestant sees in "righteousness" an ideal never reached by the human will in its own strength; the Romanist, by the term "justice," embodies itself in outward acts. The idea of righteousness involves the demand for purity; the idea of justice, one for cleanness. But seeing that Christ had all along called urgent attention to the fact that <span class="accented">that</span> which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God, and that the righteousness of his kingdom must exceed "the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees," it becomes clear that his exaltation to the right hand of the Father would exhibit God's ideal of righteousness; and by the aid of the Holy Spirit working through the word of the apostles, the world's view of these things would be utterly subverted, the world would be silenced, convicted of being utterly in the wrong in its idea of righteousness as well as in its judgment upon the nature of sin. The idea of righteousness will be expanded and transfigured; the idea of sin will be deepened and intensified and brought home. Stier has, with great eloquence and power, pressed the other view, which makes the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Holy Ghost nothing short of this - that there is no other righteousness for men than the righteousness of God in Christ and the righteousness of Christ before God. Notice, nevertheless, the occasions on which the world was brought to recognize the triumph of Christ's righteousness and confusion of its own prejudices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I go (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;)<p>Withdraw from their sight and earthly fellowship.
