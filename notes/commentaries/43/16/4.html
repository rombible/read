It is possible for those who are real enemies to God's service, to pretend zeal for it. This does not lessen the sin of the persecutors; villanies will never be changed by putting the name of God to them. As Jesus in his sufferings, so his followers in theirs, should look to the fulfilling of Scripture. He did not tell them sooner, because he was with them to teach, guide, and comfort them; they needed not then this promise of the Holy Spirit's presence. It will silence us to ask, Whence troubles come? It will satisfy us to ask, Whither go they? for we know they work for good. It is the common fault and folly of melancholy Christians to look only on the dark side of the cloud, and to turn a deaf ear to the voice of joy and gladness. That which filled the disciples' hearts with sorrow, was too great affection for this present life. Nothing more hinders our joy in God, than the love of the world, and the sorrow of the world which comes from it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These things - These things which are about to happen, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-1.htm">John 16:1-2</a>. He had foretold them that they would take place.<p>Ye may remember ... - By calling to mind that he had foretold these things they would perceive that he was omniscient, and would remember, also, the consolations which he had afforded them and the instructions which he had given them. Had these calamities come upon them without their having been foretold, their faith might have failed; they might have been tempted to suppose that Jesus was not aware of them, and of course that he was not the Messiah. God does not suffer his people to fall into trials without giving them sufficient warning, and without giving all the grace that is needful to bear them.<p>At the beginning - In the early part of the ministry of Jesus. The expression these things here refers, probably, to all the topics contained in these chapters. He had, in the early part of his ministry, forewarned them of calamities and persecutions <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>, but he had not so fully acquainted them with the nature, and design, and sources of their trials; he had not so fully apprised them of the fact, the circumstances, and the object of his death and of his ascension to heaven; he had not revealed to them so clearly that the Holy Spirit would descend, and sanctify, and guide them; and especially he had not, in one continued discourse, grouped all these things together, and placed their sorrows and consolations so fully before their minds. All these are included, it is supposed, in the expression "these things."<p>Because I was with you - This is the reason which he gives why he had not at first made known to them clearly the certainty of their calamities and their joys; and it implies:<p>1. that it was not needful to do it at once, as he was to be with them for more than three years, and could have abundant opportunity gradually to teach these things, and to prepare them for the more full announcement when he was about to leave them.<p>2. that while he was with them he would go before them, and the weight of calamities would fall on him, and consequently they did not so much then need the presence and aid of the Holy Spirit as they would when he was gone.<p>3. that his presence was to them what the presence of the Holy Spirit would be after his death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>. He could teach them all needful truth. He could console and guide them. Now that he was to leave them, he fully apprised them of what was before them, and of the descent of the Holy Spirit to do for them what he had done when with them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. these things I said not &#8230; at&#8212;from.<p>the beginning&#8212;He had said it pretty early (Lu 6:22), but not quite as in Joh 16:2.<p>because I was with you.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whatsoever I have discovered to you formerly, of my going to my Father, the coming of the Holy Ghost, your sufferings from the world, I have told you of before; you will see that they will most certainly come to pass: then you will remember what I have said unto you; and I have told you them on purpose that you may remember them, and thereby know, that although I am in the form of a man, yet I also am God blessed for ever, and did know things that should afterward come to pass, and could tell you the truth about them. And having been with you, I have not from the first of your converse with me told you these things; that is, those which relate to the world’s dealing with you (which he had told them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16</a></span>, &c, but that was after some good while’s converse with them); nor yet had he spoken to them at first about his death, resurrection, and ascension, because he was with them, and to stay with them some time, during which time he bare the brunt of all; the whole hatred of the Jews was poured out upon him: and for those other things relating to his death, and ascension, and the sending of the Spirit, he, who taught his disciples as they were able to bear them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-33.htm" title="And with many such parables spoke he the word to them, as they were able to hear it.">Mark 4:33</a></span>, had concealed these things till by his other doctrine he had prepared them to receive this revelation, and there was a necessity of his relieving them against his bodily absence, by the promise of that other Comforter the Holy Ghost. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But these things have I told you,.... Christ enlarged on this disagreeable subject, and was the more particular in enumerating the evils his apostles were to endure for his name's sake: <p>that when the time shall come; some copies read it, "their time"; so the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic render it; that is, the time when wicked men will be suffered to vent all their rage and malice: <p>ye may remember that I told you of them; which might serve greatly to confirm them in the faith of him as the omniscient God, and the true Messiah, and encourage them to depend on his veracity and faithfulness in his promises; that since the evil things which he spoke of came upon them, so they might hope, believe, and expect, that all the good things he had assured them of, should be accomplished; and also to engage them to bear their sufferings with the greater patience, since they were appointed by God, and foretold by their Lord and master. <p>And these things, adds Christ, <p>I said not unto you at the beginning; when he first called them to be followers of him; for though when he ordained them, and sent them forth to preach the Gospel in the cities of Judea, which was some time after he had called them by his grace, he did acquaint them with some of the troubles and exercises they should meet with; as that they should be hated by all men, persecuted from city to city, beat in the synagogues, delivered up to councils, and brought before kings and governors; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17</a>; yet he did not so fully and distinctly speak of these things, as here and at this time: his reason for such a conduct was this, <p>because, says he, <p>I was with you: wherefore he never spoke so fully and distinctly of their troubles, because he was with them, and took them upon himself; and indeed, whilst he was with them, the rage and malice of the Jews were not so much against his disciples, as himself; nor did he for the same reason speak so largely of the Comforter, and of the comforts they should receive from him, because as they had not the exercises they should afterwards have, so they had him to be their comforter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.

Zigabenus, comp. also Chrysostom) are announced (see, on the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves....">Matthew 10:16-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm" title="And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.">Matthew 10:28</a>); or that Christ spoke at an earlier period <span class="ital">minus aperte et parcius</span> (Bengel, comp. Grotius), and in much more <span class="ital">general</span> terms (Ebrard), but now more expressly set forth <span class="ital">in its principles</span> the character of the world’s attitude towards the disciples (Tholuck, comp. Lange); or, that He has now stated more definitely the <span class="ital">cause</span> of the hatred (Lampe); or, that He utters it here as a <span class="ital">parting word</span> (Luthardt); or even, that at an earlier period, because the thoughts of the disciples had not yet dwelt upon it, it was “<span class="ital">for them as good as not said</span>” (Hengstenberg); but the difference lies clearly before us, and is simply to be recognised (comp. also Godet), to be explained, however, from the fact that in the Synoptics more general and less definite allusions belonging to the earlier time appear with the more definite form and stamp of later expressions. The living recollection of John must here also preponderate as against the Synoptics so that his relation to theirs here is that of a corrector.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι μεθʼ ὑμῶν ἤμην</span>] It would have been unnecessary in the time of my personal association with you, since it is not till after my departure that your persecution (up to that time the hatred of the world affected <span class="ital">Himself</span>) is to commence. “Because you have me with you, they cannot well but leave you in peace, and can do nothing to you, <span class="ital">they must have done it to me previously</span>, but now it will begin,” etc., Luther.

As yet they had suffered <span class="ital">no</span> persecution; hence the thought, “I could console you” (Lücke, De Wette, and older expositors), is not to be introduced. The interpretation also: “now first, when I promise you the Spirit, can I thus openly speak to you” (Bengel, Tholuck), is not in harmony with the words.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/16.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-4.htm" title="But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, you may remember that I told you of them.

This awkward form is that due to the perplexities of the position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in the text. Frequently our Lord thus prepared his disciples for the future, called upon them to remember his predictions as pledges of his Divine mission, but still more as consolations and supply of strength when they would most of all need it. <span class="cmt_word">These things I told you not from the beginning</span>; not "at the beginning," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;</span>, nor <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-21.htm">Isaiah 40:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a>), from the beginning of my ministry (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>), and continuously throughout it. If "these things" are restricted to the prediction of cruel persecution, they are certainly contradicted by the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17, 21, 28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>, etc.; Matthew 21:36; 24:9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>, etc. The numerous explanations of the commentators, that Christ had now given a more detailed, particular, and tragic outlook, cannot be sustained. Nor does the supposition that John is here the corrector of the synoptic narrative satisfy (Meyer); nor that of Godet, that Matthew, in his tenth chapter, was gathering together all that Christ had said of this nature, antedating instructions that the Lord had given, at all explain the corresponding passages in Luke's Gospel. The language of the last clause, because <span class="cmt_word">I was with you</span>, throws more light upon it. This does not surely mean "because I was bearing for you the brunt of the opposition," - it would be unnecessary altogether to say that. All along <span class="accented">they</span> must have bitterly felt the antagonism which their Lord encountered. The difficulty is removed by including in the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of Ver. 4 what certainly is involved in the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of Ver. 1; and the reference is to the whole of his instructions touching his departure and the coming of the other Paraclete, and the principle from which the hatred of the world would spring; the explanation of the anticipated hostility which he had now offered, and the way in which they might overcome it. So long as he was with them they could not be made to understand the Divine riches of the consolation which was now so near. From the beginning he had not given all this class of instruction, because he was with them. While at their side, it was premature to speak of the special help they would require in their bereaved condition. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>But (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768;)<p>Marks a breaking off of the enumeration of fearful details; but (to say no more of these things),I have spoken these, etc.<p>At the beginning (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Properly, from the beginning.
