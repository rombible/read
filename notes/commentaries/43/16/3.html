Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-21.htm" title="But all these things will they do to you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.">John 15:21</a>. He repeats that ignorance of God is the cause of the world’s hatred and persecution, and adds here that it is ignorance of God revealed in Himself. There is a special force in the mention of this ignorance in connection with the previous verse. Men think that in exclusion, and anathemas, and persecutions, and deaths of men made like themselves in the image of God, they are offering to God an acceptable sacrifice. They can know nothing of the true nature of the living Father who pitieth every child, and willeth not the death of a sinner, and gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. They know nothing of the long-suffering and compassion of the Son of Man, who pleaded even for His murderers, “Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-3.htm" title="And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.">John 16:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">And these things will they do </span>— These cruelties will they exercise upon you, not because ye have done them any harm; but <span class="ital">because they have not known the Father nor me </span>— Which, if they had done, instead of injuring me, and exercising such inhumanities toward you, my apostles, they would have received us with the greatest affection and gratitude. Here we have the true root of persecution in all its forms; it is ignorance of God and of Christ, and of the real nature of Christianity: it is a spirit that is hostile to all true piety and virtue; and our Lord here says in effect, Let this comfort you, that none will be your enemies but the worst of men. Observe, reader, 1st, Many that pretend to know God are wretchedly ignorant of him, for <span class="ital">he that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-4.htm" title="He that said, I know him, and keeps not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.">1 John 2:4</a>. Israel of old <span class="ital">transgressed the covenant, </span>and yet cried, <span class="ital">My God, we know thee. </span>2d, They that are ignorant of Christ cannot have any right knowledge of God. In vain do men pretend to know God and religion while they slight Christ and Christianity. 3d, Those are wretchedly ignorant of God indeed, who think it an acceptable piece of religion to persecute good people. For they that know Christ, know that he came not into the world to destroy men’s lives, but to save them; that he rules by the power of truth and love, not by fire and sword. 4th, It is possible for those that are real enemies to God’s service to pretend a mighty zeal for it. Satan’s work has often been done in God’s livery, and one of the most mischievous enemies Christianity ever had, <span class="ital">sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm" title="Who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>. Nay, 5th, It is common to patronise enmity to religion, with the colour of duty to God and service to his church. God’s people have suffered the greatest hardships from conscientious persecutors: Paul <span class="ital">verily thought he ought to do </span>what he did <span class="ital">against the name of Jesus, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-9.htm" title="I truly thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.">Acts 26:9</a>. This, however, does not lessen the sin of persecutors, for villanies cannot be consecrated by their being acted in God’s name; but it greatly increases the sufferings of the persecuted to cause them to suffer under the character of being enemies to God; but there will be a resurrection of <span class="ital">names, </span>as well as of <span class="ital">bodies, </span>at the great day.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-6 Our Lord Jesus, by giving his disciples notice of trouble, designed that the terror might not be a surprise to them. It is possible for those who are real enemies to God's service, to pretend zeal for it. This does not lessen the sin of the persecutors; villanies will never be changed by putting the name of God to them. As Jesus in his sufferings, so his followers in theirs, should look to the fulfilling of Scripture. He did not tell them sooner, because he was with them to teach, guide, and comfort them; they needed not then this promise of the Holy Spirit's presence. It will silence us to ask, Whence troubles come? It will satisfy us to ask, Whither go they? for we know they work for good. It is the common fault and folly of melancholy Christians to look only on the dark side of the cloud, and to turn a deaf ear to the voice of joy and gladness. That which filled the disciples' hearts with sorrow, was too great affection for this present life. Nothing more hinders our joy in God, than the love of the world, and the sorrow of the world which comes from it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-21.htm">John 15:21</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

And it is some alleviation of trouble to God’s suffering people, to consider that the persons that are the cause of their sufferings neither know God the Father, nor Jesus Christ; and it is no wonder, if they know not God, that they will not know, love, nor approve of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And these things will they do unto you,.... Christ here opens the true spring and source of the furious zeal of the Jews, against the apostles, in putting them out of their synagogues, and taking away their lives; it was pure wilful ignorance of the Father and himself; <p>because they have not known the Father nor me; though they boasted of their knowledge of God; yet they knew him not as the Father and sender of Christ, at least they would not own him as such: nor Jesus as the true Messiah, and sent of the Father, to redeem and save his people from their sins; and since they neither knew the Father, nor Christ, it is no wonder they did not know, own, and acknowledge, the disciples of Christ, but used them in the ill manner they did; their zeal was not according to knowledge, it was a blind and misguided one: and this is mentioned, not to extenuate or excuse their sin, though it shows they were not out of the reach of mercy, because they, as the apostle says of himself, "did it ignorantly in unbelief", <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>; but as an argument with the disciples to bear their ill usage with patience, and to pity them and pray for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/16.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-3.htm" title="And these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.">John 16:3</a>.
