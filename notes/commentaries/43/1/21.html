He was not such a prophet as they expected, who would rescue them from the Romans. He gave such an account of himself, as might excite and awaken them to hearken to him. He baptized the people with water as a profession of repentance, and as an outward sign of the spiritual blessings to be conferred on them by the Messiah, who was in the midst of them, though they knew him not, and to whom he was unworthy to render the meanest service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Art thou Elias? - This is the Greek way of writing Elijah.

Yet they supposed Him not only to be distinct from Christ, but even inferior to Elias, as is evident from the gradually descending climax here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a> [Christ—Elias—that prophet]: although the people afterwards regarded the prophet as the same as Messiah the King, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-14.htm" title="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world....">John 6:14-15</a> [Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world; When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take Him by force, to make him a king, etc.]; and again, on the contrary, they looked on the prophet as a distinct person from the Christ, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-40.htm" title="Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet....">John 7:40-41</a>.

The very repudiation of Messiahship in this form seems to imply some association with the Messianic period of which they had so many conflicting ideas. Malachi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>) had predicted the coming again from heaven of Elijah the prophet, and the LXX., by translating the passage "Elijah the Tishbite," had strengthened the common mistake of a metempsychosis, or such an abnormal manifestation before the coming of Messiah. Schottgen ('De Messia,' H.H., vol. 2, pp 226, 490, 533-537) quotes a variety of proofs of this anticipation, and that Elijah was expected "<span class="accented">three</span> days before Messiah; that he would come in the mountains of Israel, weeping over the people, saying, 'O land of Israel, how long will you remain arid and desolate!'" (cf. my 'John the Baptist,' 3. &sect; 4). There was a true sense in which (as our Lord informed his disciples) John was the fulfilment of Malachi's prediction and of the language of the angel to Zacharias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-12.htm">Matthew 17:12</a>), and that John came veritably in the spirit and power of Elijah. In that sense "Elijah had come already," just as Christ their <span class="accented">David</span> had come, in fulfilment of Ezekiel's  vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>), to rule over them. In the physical, superstitious sense, John the son of Zacharias was not the reincarnation of the Prophet Elijah, and so he boldly answered the inquiry, <span class="cmt_word">Art thou Elijah?</span> with a categorical negative: I am not. They press their question once more. <span class="cmt_word">Art thou the Prophet?</span> It is doubtful whether they here take up another popular expectation of the physical return of one of the old prophets, or whether, with an exegesis afterwards modified by the apostles, they point to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, and reveal the fact that they had not identified the prediction of "the prophet like unto Moses" with their Messiah. If they <span class="accented">had</span> identified these representations, they would not, of course, have pressed him with an identical question. It is highly probable that <span class="accented">that</span> prophecy had, with the predictions of Malachi and Isaiah, led to numerous expectations more or less identified with the Messianic cycle of coming events. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-14.htm">Matthew 16:14</a>, we see the prevalence of the expectation - of a longing for an old prophet. They yearned for no upstart, but for one of the mighty brotherhood of departed men, in veritable flesh and blood. Now John and now Jesus was crudely suspected by some to be such a resuscitation. The Baptist, like the Samaritan woman, and subsequently St. Peter when full of the Holy Ghost, had sharply identified "the Prophet like unto Moses" with the Messiah himself; and therefore, on either hypothesis, he gives a curt reply to this inquiry, <span class="cmt_word">and he answered, No.</span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>What then?
