The first chapter of Genesis is still present to the mind, but a fuller meaning can now be given to its words. All things came into existence by means of the pre-existent Word, and of all the things that now exist none came into being apart from Him.<p><span class= "bld">All things.</span>—The words express in the grandeur of an unthinkable array of units what is expressed in totality by “the world” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm" title="He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.">John 1:10</a>. The completion of the thought by the negative statement of the opposite brings sharply before us the infinitely little in contrast with the infinitely great. Of all these units not one is by its vastness beyond, or by its insignificance beneath His creative will. For the relation of the Word to the Father in the work of creation, comp.

The Father spoke every thing into being by him, his Eternal Word. Thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-6.htm" title="By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.">Psalm 33:6</a>, <span class="ital">By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, </span>&c. This, however, is not the only reason why the Son of God is termed <span class="ital">the Word. </span>“He is not only called so, because God at first created and still governs all things by him; but because, as men discover their minds to one another by the intervention of words, speech, or discourse, so God, by his Son, discovers his gracious designs to men in the fullest and clearest manner. All the various manifestations which he makes of himself, whether in the works of creation, providence, or redemption, all the revelations he has been pleased to give of his will, have been, and still are, conveyed to us through him, and therefore he is, by way of eminence, fitly styled here, <span class="ital">the Word, </span>and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-13.htm" title="And he was clothed with a clothing dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.">Revelation 19:13</a>, <span class="ital">the Word of God.” </span>— Macknight. Thus also Bishop Horne: (<span class="ital">Sermons, </span>vol. 1. pp. 199, 200:) “Should it be asked, why this person is styled the <span class="ital">Word? </span>the proper answer seems to be, that as a thought, or conception of the understanding, is brought forth and communicated in <span class="ital">speech </span>or <span class="ital">discourse, </span>so is the divine will made known by the WORD, who is the offspring and emanation of the eternal mind, an emanation pure and undivided, like that of light, which is the proper issue of the sun, and yet coeval with its parent orb; since the sun cannot be supposed, by the most exact and philosophical imagination, to exist a moment without emitting light; and were the one eternal, the other, though strictly and properly produced by it, would be as strictly and properly co-eternal with it. So true is the assertion of the Nicene fathers; so apt the instance subjoined for its illustration, <span class="ital">God of God, light of light: </span>in apostolical language, <span class="greekheb">Απαυγασμα της δοξης και χαρακτηρ της υποστασεως</span>, <span class="ital">The brightness of his Father’s glory, and the express image of his person. </span>And whether we consider our Lord under the idea of the WORD, or that of LIGHT, it will lead us to the same conclusion respecting his office. For, as no man can discover the mind of another, but by the word which proceedeth from him; as no man can see the sun, but by the light which itself emitteth, even so, <span class="ital">No man knoweth the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him! </span>It may not be improper to observe further here, that “the term <span class="greekheb">λογος</span>, <span class="ital">Word, </span>was in use among the ancient philosophers, who sometimes speak of a person under that appellation as the Maker of the universe. So Tertullian informs the Gentiles: ‘Apud vestros quoque sapientes <span class="greekheb">λογον</span>, id est, Sermonem atque Rationem, constat artificem videri universitatis.’ It appears that among your wise men, the <span class="greekheb">λογος</span>, that is, the Word and Reason, was considered as the Former of the universe. And Eusebius, in the eleventh book of his Evangelical Preparation, cites a passage from Amelius, a celebrated admirer and imitator of Plato, in which he speaks of the <span class="greekheb">λογος </span>as being eternal, and the Maker of all things. This, he says, was the opinion of Heraclitus, and then introduces the beginning of the gospel of St. John; concerning whom it seems he was wont to complain, that he had transferred into his book the sentiments of his master Plato. But it is not likely that our evangelist either borrowed from, or intended to copy after Plato. And since not only Plato, but Pythagoras and Zeno likewise, conversed with the Jews, it is not at all wonderful that we meet with something about a <span class="greekheb">θειος λογος</span>, or DIVINE WORD, in their writings. Nor, after all, might the philosopher and the apostle use the same term in the same acceptation. It is customary with the writers of the New Testament to express themselves as much as may be in the language of the Old, to which, therefore, we must have recourse for an explanation of their meaning, as the penmen of both, under the direction of one Spirit, used their terms in the same sense. Now, upon looking into the Old Testament, we find, that <span class="ital">the Word of Jehovah </span>is frequently and evidently the style of a <span class="ital">person </span>who is said <span class="ital">to come, to be revealed, or manifested, </span>and the like, as in the fifteenth chapter of Genesis, <span class="ital">The word of Jehovah came unto Abraham in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abraham, </span>&c. <span class="ital">— Behold, the Word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir, and he brought him forth abroad. </span>Thus again, (1 Samuel 3.,) <span class="ital">Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh, by the Word of Jehovah. </span>The same person is, at other times, characterized by the title, <span class="ital">the Name of Jehovah, </span><span class="greekheb">שׂם יהוה</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm" title="Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:">Isaiah 30:27</a>, <span class="ital">Behold, the Name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning with his anger, </span>&c. With regard to the nature of the person thus denominated, whoever shall duly consider the attributes, powers, and actions ascribed to him, will see reason to think of him, not as a created intelligence, but a person of the divine essence, possessed of all its incommunicable properties. And it may be noticed, that the Targums, or Chaldee paraphrasts, continually substitute <span class="ital">the Word of Jehovah for Jehovah, </span>ascribing divine characters to the person so named. And the ancient <span class="ital">Grecizing </span>Jews speak in the same style. Thus, in that excellent apocryphal book of <span class="ital">Wisdom, </span>(ix. 1,) <span class="ital">O God, who hast made all things, </span><span class="greekheb">εν λογω σου</span>, <span class="ital">by thy Word; </span>and again in the passage which so wonderfully describes the horrors of that night, never to be forgotten by an Israelite, wherein the firstborn of the Egyptians were slain: <span class="ital">While all things were in</span> <span class="ital">quiet silence, and that night was in the midst of her swift course, thine Almighty </span>WORD (<span class="greekheb">λογος</span>) <span class="ital">leaped down from heaven, out of thy royal throne, as a fierce man of war, into the midst of a land of destruction, and brought thy unfeigned commandment, as a sharp sword; and standing up filled all things with death; and it touched the heaven, but stood upon the earth, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-14.htm" title="Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.">John 18:14</a>.” Horne’s <span class="ital">Discourses, </span>disc. 7. vol. 1. pp. 194-197. <span class="ital">And without him was not any thing made </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ουδε εν</span>, not so much as any single thing having existence, whether among the nobler or the meaner works of God, was made without him. See the same truth attested and enlarged upon by Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>. Now, “if all things were made by him, he cannot be himself of the number of the things that were made. He is superior, therefore, to every created being. Besides, it should be remembered, that in the Old Testament, the creation of the heavens and the earth is often mentioned as the prerogative of the true God, whereby he is distinguished from the heathen idols. The design of the evangelist in establishing so particularly and distinctly the dignity, but especially the divinity of Christ, was to raise in mankind the most profound veneration for him, and for all his instructions and actions. And, without doubt, he who is the Word of God, the interpreter of the divine counsels, and who is himself God, ought to be heard with the deepest attention, and obeyed with the most implicit submission.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 The plainest reason why the Son of God is called the Word, seems to be, that as our words explain our minds to others, so was the Son of God sent in order to reveal his Father's mind to the world. What the evangelist says of Christ proves that he is God. He asserts, His existence in the beginning; His coexistence with the Father. The Word was with God. All things were made by him, and not as an instrument. Without him was not any thing made that was made, from the highest angel to the meanest worm. This shows how well qualified he was for the work of our redemption and salvation. The light of reason, as well as the life of sense, is derived from him, and depends upon him. This eternal Word, this true Light shines, but the darkness comprehends it not. Let us pray without ceasing, that our eyes may be opened to behold this Light, that we may walk in it; and thus be made wise unto salvation, by faith in Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All things - The universe. The expression cannot be limited to any part of the universe. It appropriately expresses everything which exists - all the vast masses of material worlds, and all the animals and things, great or small, that compose those worlds. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>.<p>Were made - The original word is from the verb "to be," and signifies "were" by him; but it expresses the idea of creation here. It does not alter the sense whether it is said "'were' by him," or "were 'created' by him." The word is often used in the sense of "creating," or forming from nothing. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-7.htm">Isaiah 48:7</a>; in the Septuagint.<p>By him - In this place it is affirmed that "creation" was effected by "the Word," or the Son of God. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, it is said that the Being who created the heavens and the earth was God. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25-28</a>, this work is ascribed to Yahweh. The "Word," or the Son of God, is therefore appropriately called "God." The work of "creation" is uniformly ascribed in the Scriptures to the Second Person of the Trinity. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10</a>. By this is meant, evidently, that he was the agent, or the efficient cause, by which the universe was made. There is no higher proof of omnipotence than the work of creation; and, hence, God often appeals to that work to prove that he is the true God, in opposition to idols. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18-28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-2.htm">Psalm 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>. It is absurd to say that God can invest a creature with omnipotence. If He can make a creature omnipotent, He can make him omniscient, and can in the same way make him omnipresent, and infinitely wise and good; that is, He can invest a creature with all His own attributes, or make another being like Himself, or, which is the same thing, there could be two Gods, or as many Gods as He should choose to make. But this is absurd! The Being, therefore, that "created" all things must be divine; and, since this work is ascribed to Jesus Christ, and as it is uniformly in the Scriptures declared to be the work of God, Jesus Christ is therefore equal with the Father.<p>Without him - Without his agency; his notice; the exertion of his power. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>. This is a strong way of speaking, designed to confirm, beyond the possibility of doubt, what he had just said. He says, therefore, in general, that all things were made by Christ. In this part of the verse he shuts out all doubt, and affirms that there was "no exception;" that there was not a single thing, however minute or unimportant, which was not made by him. In this way, he confirms what he said in the first verse. Christ was not merely called God, but he did the works of God, and therefore the name is used in its proper sense as implying supreme divinity. To this same test Jesus himself appealed as proving that he was divine. <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-37.htm">John 10:37</a>, "if I do not the works of my Father, believe me not." <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>, "my Father worketh hitherto, and I work." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Which is a proof at once of all that is said before; as that he was in the beginning; and that he was with God the Father in the beginning; and that he was God; otherwise all things could not have been made by him, had either of these been untrue: which is to be understood, not of the new creation; for this would be a restraining "all" things to a "few" persons only; nor is it any where said, that all things are new made, but made; and it is false, that all were converted, that have been converted, by the ministry of Christ, as man: all men are not renewed, regenerated, nor reformed; and the greater part of those that were renewed, were renewed before Christ existed, as man; and therefore could not be renewed by him, as such: though indeed, could this sense be established, it would not answer the end for which it is coined; namely, to destroy the proof of Christ's deity, and of his existence before his incarnation; for in all ages, from the beginning of the world, some have been renewed; and the new creation is a work of God, and of almighty power, equally with the old; for who can create spiritual light, infuse a principle of spiritual life, take away the heart of stone, and give an heart of flesh, or produce faith, but God? Regeneration is denied to be of man, and is always ascribed to God; nor would Christ's being the author of the new creation, be any contradiction to his being the author of the old creation, which is intended here: by "all things", are meant the heaven, and all its created inhabitants, the airy, starry, and third heavens, and the earth, and all therein, the sea, and every thing that is in that; and the word, or Son of God, is the efficient cause of all these, not a bare instrument of the formation of them; for the preposition by does not always denote an instrument, but sometimes an efficient, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a> and so here, though not to the exclusion of the Father, and of the Spirit: <p>and without him was not any thing made that was made: in which may be observed the conjunct operation of the word, or Son, with the Father, and Spirit, in creation; and the extent of his concern in it to every thing that is made; for without him there was not one single thing in the whole compass of the creation made; and the limitation of it to things that are made; and so excludes the uncreated being, Father, Son, and Spirit; and sin also, which is not a principle made by God, and which has no efficient, but a deficient cause. So the Jews ascribe the creation of all things to the word. The Targumists attribute the creation of man, in particular, to the word of God: it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>. "God created man in his own image": the Jerusalem Targum of it is, <p>"and the word of the Lord created man in his likeness. <p>And <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a> "and the Lord God said, behold the man is become as one of us", the same Targum paraphrases thus, <p>"and the word of the Lord God said, behold the man whom I have created, is the only one in the world. <p>Also in the same writings, the creation of all things in general is ascribed to the word: the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-27.htm">Deuteronomy 33:27</a> "the eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms", is paraphrased by Onkelos, <p>"the eternal God is an habitation, by whose word the world was made. <p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-13.htm">Isaiah 48:13</a> it is said, "mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth". The Targum of Jonathan ben Uzziah on it is, <p>"yea, by my word I have founded the earth: <p>which agrees with what is said in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>, and the same says Philo the Jew, who not only calls him the archetype, and exemplar of the world, but the power that made it: he often ascribes the creation of the heavens, and the earth unto him, and likewise the creation of man after whose image, he says, he was made (t).

We are not to suppose that by this negative reference John meant to exclude (so Lücke, Olshausen, De Wette, Frommann, Maier, Baeumlein) the doctrine of a <span class="greekheb">ὕλη</span> having an extra-temporal existence (Philo, <span class="ital">l.c.</span>), because <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span> and <span class="greekheb">γέγονεν</span> describe that which exists only <span class="ital">since the creation</span>, as <span class="ital">having come</span> into existence, and therefore <span class="greekheb">ὕλη</span> would not be included in the conception. John neither held nor desired to oppose the idea of the <span class="greekheb">ὕλη</span>; the antithesis has no polemical design—not even of an anti-gnostic kind—to point out that the Logos is raised above the series of Aeons (Tholuck); for though the world of spirits is certainly included in the <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span> and the <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ ἕν</span>, it is not specially designated (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>).

This belongs to the emphatic <span class="ital">fulness</span> of the statement (Bornemann, <span class="ital">Schol. in Luc</span>. p. xxxvii.), and connects itself with what <span class="ital">precedes</span>. The very ancient connection of it with what <span class="ital">follows</span> (C. D. L. Verss., Clem. Al., Origen, and other Greeks, Heracleon, Ptolemaeus, <span class="ital">Philos. Orig</span>. v. 8, Latin Fathers, also Augustine, Wetst., Lachm., Weisse), by putting the comma after either <span class="greekheb">γέγ</span>. or <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span> (so already the Valentinians),[76] is to be rejected, although it would harmonize with John’s manner of carrying forward the members of his sentences, whereby “ex proximo membro sumitur gradus sequentis” (Erasmus); but in other respects it would only be Johannean if the comma were placed after <span class="greekheb">γέγ</span>. (so also Lachm.). The ground of rejection lies not in the ambiguity of <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span>, which cannot surprise us in John, but in this, that the <span class="ital">perfect</span> <span class="greekheb">γέγονεν</span>, as implying continuance, would have logically required <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> after <span class="greekheb">ζωή</span>; to <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> not <span class="greekheb">γέγονεν</span> but <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span> would have been appropriate, so that the sense would have been: “what came into existence had in Him its ground or source of life.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[76] “<span class="ital">Whatever originated in Him</span> (self) <span class="ital">is life</span>.” The latter is said to be the Zoë, which with the Logos formed one Syzygy. Hilgenfeld regards this view as correct, in connection with the assumption of the later Gnostic origin of the Gospel. But the construction is false as regards the <span class="ital">words</span>, because neither <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> nor <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span> stands in the passage; and false also as regards the <span class="ital">thought</span>, because, according to vv. 1–3, a principle of life cannot have first originated in the Logos, but must <span class="ital">have existed</span> from the very beginning. Even Bunsen (<span class="ital">Hypol</span>. II. 291, 357) erroneously preferred the punctuation of the Alexandrines and Gnostics.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πάντα διʼ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο</span>. The connection is obvious: the Word was with God in the beginning, but not as an idle, inefficacious existence, who only then for the first time put forth energy when He came into the world. On the contrary, He was the source of all activity and life. “All things were made by Him, and without Him was not even one thing made which was made.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The double sentence, positive and negative, is characteristic of John and lends emphasis to the statement.—<span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>, “grande verbum quo mundus, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, universitas rerum factarum denotatur” (Bengel). The more accurate expression for “all things” taken as a whole and not severally is <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>) or <span class="greekheb">τὸ πᾶν</span>; and, as the negative clause of this verse indicates, created things are here looked at in their variety and multiplicity. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Marcus Aurelius, iv. 23, <span class="greekheb">ὧ φύσις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐκ σοῦ πᾶντα</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν σοὶ πάντα</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς σέ σοί πάντα</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς σέ πάντα</span>.—<span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span>. The Word was the Agent in creation. But it is to be observed that the same preposition is used of God in the same connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm" title="For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.

This word does not by one solitary expression dogmatically convey the creative act, but the fact of the "becoming," from, it may be, the region of pure thought to that of existence, or from non-observation into prominence, or from an inchoate to a perfect development, or from nothing to something. The context must determine the fulness of its meaning. Occasionally, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, it is powerfully contrasted with existence:  "Before Abraham was [had come into being] I am." The context here does not allow us to affirm that St. John repudiated the prior existence of the <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, stuff, of which <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> were made. He does not affirm nor deny such a prior existency or condition, but by referring the universe in all its parts and items to the <span class="accented">Logos</span>, he absolutely ignores the Platonic notion of eternal matter. He could scarcely be ignorant of the speculation as it entered into the Philonic interpretation and formed the basis of the Gnostic speculations which were beginning to infest the early Church. By giving, however, a Divine origin and instrument to the "becoming" of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, and strengthening his statement by the negative coassurance, he absolutely excludes the dualism of Philo and of Gnostic tendency. In asserting that the Logos is he or that through whom all things were made, the writer does not lower the dignity of the Logos by regarding him merely as the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the Father, because the same preposition is used of the relation of the Father to the world or to his servants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). Elsewhere St. Paul powerfully affirms the same application of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>) to Christ's part in the Creation, reserving for the One God, the Father, the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>. <span class="accented">From</span> God and <span class="accented">by</span> or <span class="accented">through</span> God are all things, still "all things" derive their existence "through" the activity, the will, the thought, of the Logos. "The sphere contracts as the blessing enlarges [query, 'intensifies']: existence for everything; life for vegetable and animal world; light for men" (Plummer). The same idea is made more explicit by the negative form in which it is restated: <span class="cmt_word">and without him -</span> that is, independently of his cooperation and volition (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">not even</span> <span class="cmt_word">one thing came into being.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> could hardly be spoken of as "one thing," seeing, according to the theory, it was not a unit as opposed to a multiplicity, but the condition of all things. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> would drive harder against any recognition of the <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> than would the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>. There is not the faintest approach to any supposition on John's part of the existence of such a primeval entity or eternal reality. The <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> gives the student of the text and of the meaning grave difficulty. From very early times the Alexandrine Fathers and numerous uncial manuscripts, and an immense group of quotations and versions, unquestionably close the sentence we have just considered with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;</span>, and consider the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as the subject of the following clause, translating it either, <span class="accented">That which has come into being in him was life</span>; or, <span class="accented">that which has come into being was</span> (or <span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="accented">life in him</span> - for one manuscript, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, has rendered the text more grammatical by reading <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>. This, adopting the supposed early punctuation, Tregelles and Westcott  and Hort have introduced into the text; but R.T. has coincided with T.R. Dr. Westcott has an elaborate note affirming the deep thought involved in the "ancient punctuation," to the effect that the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> refers, not merely to the original creation, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, but to the continued existence of that which has come into being. Of this, it is said, it derives its life, has its life in the Logos, and that this idea is expressed in a profounder way than by saying <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>; that it <span class="accented">was life</span> (before it was called into being, or became) <span class="accented">in him.</span> This profound and mysterious statement is affirmed by Dr. Moulton and Dr. Westcott to find different but clear expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>, "Thou art worthy, our Lord and our God, to receive glory, etc.; for thou didst create all things, and for thy pleasure they were [<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, the reading preferred by Tisehendorf (8th edit.) and Westcott and Herr, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, 'they are'] and were created." Dr. Westcott thinks that "life" here represents "the Divine element in creation, that in virtue of which things 'are' each according to the fulness of its being." What has been created represents the eternal thought, the life that it had in the Logos before the world was. Unless one were compelled to take this thought by the exigencies of the textual criticism, we should hesitate to affirm that this can be the author's intention. To us the common punctuation is far more satisfactory m meaning: <span class="accented">Apart from him there came into existence not one thing which has come into existence.</span> This, in its grand comprehensiveness and individualizing of every molecule and every force, brings the mind of the reader down from eternity to time, from the creation to the preservation and providence of the world, and it prepares the way for the great assertion of the following verse. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>All things (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>Regarded severally. The reference is to the infinite detail of creation, rather than to creation as a whole, which is expressed by &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, the all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>). For this reason John avoids the word &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, the world, which denotes the world as a great system. Hence Bengel, quoted by Meyer, is wrong in referring to &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#837; (the world) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a> as a parallel.<p>Were made (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>Literally, came into being, or became. Expressing the passage from nothingness into being, and the unfolding of a divine order. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>. Three words are used in the New Testament to express the act of creation: &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, to create (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm">Revelation 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-6.htm">Revelation 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>); &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, to make (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-7.htm">Revelation 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6</a>), both of which refer to the Creator; and &#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to become, which refers to that which is created. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6</a>, both words occur. "From the beginning of the creation (&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;) God made" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;). So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a> : "We are His workmanship (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;), created (&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;) in Christ Jesus." Here the distinction is between the absolute being expressed by &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>), and the coming into being of creation (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;). The same contrast occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>. "A man sent from God came into being" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;); "the true Light was" (&#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;).<p>"The main conception of creation which is present in the writings of St. John is expressed by the first notice which he makes of it: All things came into being through the Word. This statement sets aside the notions of eternal matter and of inherent evil in matter. 'There was when' the world 'was not' (<a href="http://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>); and, by implication, all things as made were good. The agency of the Word, 'who was God,' again excludes both the idea of a Creator essentially inferior to God, and the idea of an abstract Monotheism in which there is no living relation between the creature and the Creator; for as all things come into being 'through' the Word, so they are supported 'in' Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> sq.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>). And yet more, the use of the term &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;, came into being, as distinguished from &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;, were created, suggests the thought that creation is to be regarded (according to our apprehension) as a manifestation of a divine law of love. Thus creation (all things came into being through Him) answers to the Incarnation (the Word became flesh). All the unfolding and infolding of finite being to the last issue lies in the fulfillment of His will who is love" (Westcott, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-17.htm">1 John 2:17</a>).<p>By Him (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Literally, through him. The preposition &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769; is generally used to denote the working of God through some secondary agency, as &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, through the prophet (<a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22</a>, on which see note). It is the preposition by which the relation of Christ to creation is usually expressed (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>), though it is occasionally used of the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>, where it is used of both). Hence, as Godet remarks, it "does not lower the Word to the rank of a simple instrument," but merely implies a different relation to creation on the part of the Father and the Son.<p>Without (&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Literally, apart from. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>.<p>Was not anything made that was made (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;).<p>Many authorities place the period after &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;, and join &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; with what follows, rendering, "without Him was not anything made. That which hath been made was life in Him."<p>Made (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>As before, came into being.<p>Not anything (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#788;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>continued...</body></html>
