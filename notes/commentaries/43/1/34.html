The paschal lamb, in the shedding and sprinkling of its blood, the roasting and eating of its flesh, and all the other circumstances of the ordinance, represented the salvation of sinners by faith in Christ. And the lambs sacrificed every morning and evening, can only refer to Christ slain as a sacrifice to redeem us to God by his blood. John came as a preacher of repentance, yet he told his followers that they were to look for the pardon of their sins to Jesus only, and to his death. It agrees with God's glory to pardon all who depend on the atoning sacrifice of Christ. He takes away the sin of the world; purchases pardon for all that repent and believe the gospel. This encourages our faith; if Christ takes away the sin of the world, then why not my sin? He bore sin for us, and so bears it from us. God could have taken away sin, by taking away the sinner, as he took away the sin of the old world; but here is a way of doing away sin, yet sparing the sinner, by making his Son sin, that is, a sin-offering, for us. See Jesus taking away sin, and let that cause hatred of sin, and resolutions against it. Let us not hold that fast, which the Lamb of God came to take away. To confirm his testimony concerning Christ, John declares the appearance at his baptism, in which God himself bore witness to him. He saw and bare record that he is the Son of God. This is the end and object of John's testimony, that Jesus was the promised Messiah. John took every opportunity that offered to lead people to Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The same said ... - This was the sign by which he was to know the Messiah. He was to see the Spirit descending like a dove and abiding on him.

From <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-14</a>, it seems that John supposed, before the baptism of Jesus, that he claimed to be the Messiah, and, that he believed it; but the infallible, certain testimony in the case was the descent of the Holy Spirit on him at his baptism.<p>That this is the Son of God - This was distinctly declared by a voice from heaven at his baptism, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>.

As He drew near for baptism one day, the last of all the crowd, the spirit of the Baptist heaving under a divine presentiment that the moment had at length arrived, and an air of unwonted serenity and dignity, not without traits, probably, of the family features, appearing in this Stranger, the Spirit said to him as to Samuel of his youthful type, "Arise, anoint Him, for this is He!" (1Sa 16:12). But the sign which he was told to expect was the visible descent of the Spirit upon Him as He emerged out of the baptismal water.

The position of the Baptist in the Prologue is the result of the history itself. That the meaning attaching to <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ</span> in the fourth Gospel generally is quite different from that which it has in the Synoptics (Baur), is a view which the passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-27.htm" title="All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.">Matthew 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>, should have prevented from being entertained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Note</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-32.htm" title="And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him....">John 1:32-34</a> we may observe in general: (1.) The <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> and the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ἁγιον</span> are not to be regarded as identical in John’s view (against Baur, <span class="ital">bibl. Theol. d. N. T</span>. II. 268; J. E. Chr. Schmidt, in <span class="ital">d. Bibl. f. Krit. u. Exeg</span>. I. 3, p. 361 ff.; Eichhorn, <span class="ital">Einl</span>. II. 158 ff.; Winzer, <span class="ital">Progr</span>., Lps. 1819), against which the <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος σὰρξ ἐγένετο</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a> is itself conclusive, in view of which the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> in our passage appears as an hypostasis distinct from the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, an hypostasis of which the <span class="greekheb">σὰρξ ἐγένετο</span> could not have been predicated. The <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> was the substratum of the divine side in Christ, which having become incarnate, entered upon a human development, in which the divine-human subject needed the power and incitement of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>. (2.) He was of necessity under this influence of the Spirit from the very outset of the development of His divine-human consciousness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm" title="And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was on him.">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-52.htm" title="And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.">Luke 2:52</a>, and the visit when twelve years old to the temple), and long before the moment of His baptism, so that the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> was the awakening and mediating principle of the consciousness which Jesus possessed of His oneness with God; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm" title="Say you of him, whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am the Son of God?">John 10:36</a>. Accordingly, we are not to suppose that the Holy Ghost was given to Him now for the first time, and was added consciously to His divine-human life as a new and third element; the text speaks not of a <span class="ital">receiving</span>, but of a <span class="ital">manifestation</span> of the Spirit, as seen by John, which in this form visibly came down and remained over Him, in order to point Him out to the Baptist as the Messiah who, according to O. T. prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>), was to possess the fulness of the Spirit. The purpose of this divine <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> was not, therefore (as Matthew and Mark indeed represent it), to <span class="ital">impart</span> the Spirit to Jesus (which is not implied even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm" title="For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.">John 3:34</a>), but simply for the sake of the Baptist, to divinely <span class="ital">indicate</span> to him who was to make Him known in Israel, that individuality who, as the incarnate Logos, must long before then have possessed the powers of the Spirit in all their fulness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm" title="For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.">John 3:34</a>). The <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> in the symbolic form of a dove hovered over Jesus, remained over Him for a while, and then again vanished (comp. Schleiermacher, <span class="ital">L. J</span>. p. 150). This the Baptist saw; and he now knows, through a previously received revelation made to him for the purpose <span class="ital">who</span> it is that he has to make known as the Messiah who baptizes with the Spirit. To find in this passage a special stimulus imparted through the Spirit to Jesus Himself, and perceived by the Baptist, tending to the development or opening up of His divine—human consciousness and life (Lücke, Neander, Tholuck, Osiander, Ebrard, De Wette, Riggenbach, and others; comp. Lange, and Beyschlag, p. 103), or the equipment of the Logos for a coming forth out of a state of <span class="ital">immanence</span> (Frommann), or the communication of <span class="ital">official</span> power (Gess, <span class="ital">Pers. Chr</span>. p. 374; comp. Wörner, <span class="ital">Verhältn. d. Geistes</span>, p. 44), as the principle of which the Spirit was now given in order to render the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> fit to become the instrument of His self-manifestation (Luthardt, after Kahnis, <span class="ital">vom heiligen Geiste</span>, p. 44; comp. also Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. I. 191, II. 1, 166; Godet; and Weisse, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr</span>. p. 268, who connects with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>),—as in a similar way B. Crusius already explained the communication of the Spirit as if the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> (in distinction from the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>) were now received by Jesus, as that which was <span class="ital">to be</span> further <span class="ital">communicated to mankind;</span>—these and all such theories find no justification from our Gospel at least, which simply records a <span class="ital">manifestation</span> made to the <span class="ital">Baptist</span>, not a communication to <span class="ital">Jesus;</span> and to it must be accorded decisive weight when brought face to face with those other diverging accounts. Thus, at the same time, this whole manifestation must not be regarded as an empty, objectless play of the imagination (Lücke): it was an objective and real <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> divinely presented to the Baptist’s spiritual vision, the design of which (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα φανερωθῇ τῷ Ἰσραήλ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a>, that is, through the Baptist’s testimony) was sufficiently important as the <span class="greekheb">γνώρισμα</span> of the Messiah (Justin. <span class="ital">c. Tryph</span>. 88), and the result of which (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-34.htm" title="And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God.">John 1:34</a>) corresponded to its design; whereas, upon the supposition that we have here a record of the <span class="ital">receiving</span> of the Spirit, there is imported into the exposition something quite foreign to the text. If this supposition be surrendered, then the opinion loses all support that the descent of the Spirit upon Jesus at His baptism is a mythical inference of Ebionitism (Strauss), as well as the assertion that here too our Gospel stands upon the boundary line of Gnosticism (Baur); while the boldness of view which goes still further, and (in the face of the <span class="greekheb">βαπτίζων ἐν πνεύματι ἁγίῳ</span>) takes the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> to be, not the Holy Spirit, but the <span class="ital">Logos</span> (in spite of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), which as a heavenly Aeon was for the first time united at the baptism with Jesus the earthly man (so Hilgenfeld, following the Valentinian Gnosis), does not even retain its claim to be considered a later historical analogy. There remains, however, in any case, the great fact of which the Baptist witnesses—“<span class="ital">the true birth-hour of Christendom</span>” (Ewald): for, on the one hand, the divinely sent forerunner of the Messiah now received the divinely revealed certainty as to <span class="ital">whom</span> his work as Elias pointed; and, on the other hand, by the divinely assured testimony which he now bore to Jesus before the people, the Messianic consciousness of Jesus Himself received not only the consecration of a heavenly ratification, but the warrant of the Father’s will, that now <span class="ital">the hour was come for the holy</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀρχή</span> of His ministry in word and work. It was not that now for the first time the Messiah’s <span class="ital">resolve</span> was formed; rather was it the <span class="ital">entrance</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-23.htm" title="Of this man's seed has God according to his promise raised to Israel a Savior, Jesus:">Acts 13:23</a>) upon His great work, the commencement of its realization, which was the great event in the world’s history that marked this hour, when the fulness of time was come for the accomplishment of the counsel of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-34.htm" title="And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God.">John 1:34</a>. <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ ἑώρακα</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ</span>. “And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.” The Synoptists tell us that a voice was heard at the baptism declaring “this is my beloved Son”; and in the Temptation Satan uses the title. Nathanael at the very beginning of the ministry, and the demoniacs very little later, use the same designation. This was in a rigidly monotheistic community and in a community in which the same title had been applied to the king, to designate a certain alliance and close relation between the human representative and the Divine Sovereign. Whether the Baptist in his peculiar circumstances had begun to suspect that a fuller meaning attached to the title, we do not know. Unquestionably the Baptist must have found his ideas of the Messianic office expanding under the influence of intercourse with Jesus, and must more than ever have seen that this was a unique title setting Jesus apart from all other men. The basis of the application of the title to the Messiah is to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm" title="I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:">2 Samuel 7:14</a>, “I will be to him a Father and he will be to me a Son”. In the second and eighty-ninth Psalms the term is seen passing into a Messianic sense, and that it should appear in the N.T. as a title of the Messiah is inevitable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34</span>. <span class="ital">And I saw, and bare record</span>] Better, <span class="ital">And I</span> <span class="bld">have seen</span> <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">have borne witness</span>. ‘I have seen’ is in joyous contrast to ‘I knew Him not,’ <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a></span>. ‘Have borne witness’ is the same verb as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-7.htm" title="The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe....">John 1:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-32.htm" title="And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him.">John 1:32</a></span> : hence ‘witness’ is preferable to ‘record’ both here and in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-32.htm" title="And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him.">John 1:32</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Son of God</span>] The Messiah.

The Old Testament standpoint which John occupied enabled him from the first to identify the Messiah with the "Son of God;" but surely this is the record of the first occasion when the Baptist recognized the token that One who sustained such relation with the Father stood before him. There is much in this Gospel and the synoptic narrative to show that the disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16, 17</a>) identified the Christ with the Son of God. The tempter and the demoniacs are familiar with the idea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-11.htm">Mark 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>). The high priest at the trial and the Roman centurion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-40.htm">Matthew 27:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-61.htm">Mark 14:61</a>), Nathanael (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a>), Martha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-27.htm">John 11:27</a>), hail him as Son of God. Though the Lord for the most part preferred to speak of himself as "Son of man," yet in this Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm">John 6:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm">John 10:36</a>) he frequently claims this lofty designation. Nor is it confined to this Gospel, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25-27</a>, we have practically the same confession. Now, the declaration of this verse is in intimate connection with what precedes. Neither the Baptist nor the evangelist implies that, by Christ's baptism, and by that which John saw of the descent and abiding of the Spirit upon the Lord, he was there and then constituted "the Son of God." From this misapprehension of the Gospel arose the Gnostic-Ebionite view of the heavenly <span class="accented">Soter</span> descending on Christ, to depart from him at the Crucifixion. The main significance of the entire paragraph is the special revelation given to John, his consequent illumination and momentous testimony, one that sank into the soul of his most susceptible disciples, and thus made this declaration the "<span class="accented">true birth hour of Christendom"</span> (Ewald, Meyer). The narrative does not imply that Christ's own consciousness of Divine sonship then commenced. He knew who he was when he spoke, at twelve years of age, of "the business of my Father;" but it would be equally inadequate exegesis to suppose that no communication was then made to the sacred humanity which had been fashioned by the Holy Spirit in the womb of the virgin, and by which he became from the first "the Son of God." The Lord's humanity did become alive to the solemn and awful responsibilities of this public recognition. He knew that the hour was come for his Messianic activity, and the distinct admission of this was the basis of each of the diabolic temptations from which he immediately suffered. There was a unique glory in this sonship which differed from all other usage of the same phrase. Many an Oriental mystic and Egyptian pharaoh and even Roman emperor had thus described themselves; but the Baptist did not speak of himself in this or any other sense as "Son of God." There was flashed into his mind the light of a Divine relationship between Jesus and the Father which convinced him of the preexisting life of him who was chronologically coming after him. It was probably this momentous utterance which led to the deputation of the Sanhedrin, and induced them to ask for the explanation of a mystery transcending all that John had said from the day of his showing unto Israel" (see my 'John the Baptist,' lect. 6. &sect; 1). Many commentators here encounter the unquestionable difficulty of John the Baptist's message from the prison. I prefer to discuss it at the close of ch. 3. (see my 'John the Baptist,' lect. 7: "The Ministry of the Prison"). Here it is sufficient to observe that the vivid intuition and revelation which John obtained touching the deep things of God in Christ, and the vast and far-reaching testimonies which he bore to the Son of God, to the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, the pre-existent glory of him that came after him, and to "the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world," were, nevertheless, in <span class="accented">the evangelist's mind historically coincident</span> with the fact that John never did unite himself to the circle of Christ's immediate followers. The "John" of the Fourth Gospel remained in an independent position - friendly, rejoicing in the Bridegroom's voice, but not one of his followers. The preparatory work with which he began his ministry he continued and pursued to the tragic end. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I saw (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;)<p>Rev., more strictly, according to the perfect tense, I have seen.
