Rather it is that, in that band of disciples too, there is an inner circle of those who, because they can receive more, are taught more. They had heard the words before, it may be had talked together about them, at least in individual thought had tried to follow them, and now they have come to the Teacher again. Can we doubt what questions fill the heart or shape themselves in word? He had passed through their struggle from darkness into light. There is a Presence with them which he now knows, and before which his own work must cease. The passing voice is no longer needed now that the abiding Word has come. Can we doubt what his answer is?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-35.htm" title="Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;...">John 1:35-39</a></span>. <span class="ital">The next day, John stood, and two of his disciples </span>— John happening the next day to be with two of his disciples on the banks of Jordan, he saw Jesus passing by a second time, and repeated what he had said to the multitude the day before. Probably he pointed out Jesus to these two disciples because they had been absent when the Spirit descended upon him, and the voice from heaven declared him to be the Son of God. But having now had an account of these things from their master, they desired to become acquainted with Jesus, and for that purpose followed him. <span class="ital">Then Jesus turned, </span>&c. — Jesus, knowing their intentions, turned about; <span class="ital">and saith, What seek ye? </span>— Thus he spake, not to discountenance and turn them back, but to encourage and invite them to a free converse with him. <span class="ital">They said unto him </span>— With the greatest reverence and respect; <span class="ital">Rabbi </span>— Which, being interpreted from the Syriac, the language then spoken by the Jews, signifies, <span class="ital">Master; where dwellest thou </span>— <span class="greekheb">Που μενεις</span>, <span class="ital">where dost thou lodge? </span>For Jesus had no fixed abode at Jordan, being come thither only to be baptized. By making this reply, John’s disciples intimated that they had a great inclination to converse with Jesus. He gave them, therefore, an invitation to his lodging, which they readily accepted; <span class="ital">and abode with him that day </span>— The remainder of it; <span class="ital">for it was about the tenth hour </span>— Or, four in the afternoon; so that they had an opportunity of spending the rest of the evening with him, doubtless, much to their satisfaction and delight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:29-36 John saw Jesus coming to him, and pointed him out as the Lamb of God. The paschal lamb, in the shedding and sprinkling of its blood, the roasting and eating of its flesh, and all the other circumstances of the ordinance, represented the salvation of sinners by faith in Christ. And the lambs sacrificed every morning and evening, can only refer to Christ slain as a sacrifice to redeem us to God by his blood. John came as a preacher of repentance, yet he told his followers that they were to look for the pardon of their sins to Jesus only, and to his death. It agrees with God's glory to pardon all who depend on the atoning sacrifice of Christ. He takes away the sin of the world; purchases pardon for all that repent and believe the gospel. This encourages our faith; if Christ takes away the sin of the world, then why not my sin? He bore sin for us, and so bears it from us. God could have taken away sin, by taking away the sinner, as he took away the sin of the old world; but here is a way of doing away sin, yet sparing the sinner, by making his Son sin, that is, a sin-offering, for us. See Jesus taking away sin, and let that cause hatred of sin, and resolutions against it. Let us not hold that fast, which the Lamb of God came to take away. To confirm his testimony concerning Christ, John declares the appearance at his baptism, in which God himself bore witness to him. He saw and bare record that he is the Son of God. This is the end and object of John's testimony, that Jesus was the promised Messiah. John took every opportunity that offered to lead people to Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The next day - The day after his remarkable testimony that Jesus was the Son of God. This testimony of John is reported because it was the main design of this evangelist to show that Jesus was the Messiah. See the introduction. To do this, he adduces the decided and repeated testimony of John the Baptist. This was impartial evidence in the case, and hence he so particularly dwells upon it.John stood - Or was standing. This was probably apart from the multitude.<p>Two of his disciples - One of these was Andrew <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40</a>, and it is not improbable that the other was the writer of this gospel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35.

Answers have been devised; <span class="ital">e.g</span>. Bengel: “Jesus had sufficiently humbled Himself by once joining Himself with John;” Lampe: “He wished to avoid the suspicion of any private understanding with the Baptist.” Equally without warrant in the text, B. Crusius and Luthardt: “Jesus had already separated Himself from the Baptist to begin His own proper ministry, while the Baptist desired indirectly to command his disciples to join themselves with Jesus;” as Hengstenberg also supposes, judging from the result, and because he at the same time regards the two as representatives of all John’s disciples.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[120] Already Chrysostom (according to Corderius, <span class="ital">Cat</span>.; Theodore of Mopsuestia) mentions the same view, but along with it the other: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐκεῖνος οὐχὶ τῶν ἐπισήμων ἦν</span>, which he seems to approve of.—But if <span class="ital">John</span> is here already (and see on ver. 42) indicated, though not by name, and afterwards (ver. 46) <span class="ital">Bartholomew</span> under the name <span class="ital">Nathanael</span>; if, again, ver. 42 implies that <span class="ital">James</span> is brought to Jesus by his brother John, and that he therefore has his place <span class="ital">after</span> John; then we certainly cannot say, with Steitz (in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.

His kingly lordship over men He reveals (1) by making Himself accessible to inquirers: Andrew and John; (2) by giving a new name, implying new character: Simon becomes Peter; (3) by summoning men to follow Him: Philip; (4) by interpreting and satisfying men’s deepest desires and aspirations: Nathanael.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">35–37</span>.
