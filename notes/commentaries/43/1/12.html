All who according to their light and means accept Him, receive from Him an authority and in Him a moral power, which constitutes them members of the true none to which He came, and the true children of God. They receive in acceptance the right which others lost in rejection. (Comp. Romans 9-11) The word rendered “received” is not quite the same as the word so rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm" title="He came to his own, and his own received him not.">John 1:11</a>. The latter is the welcome which may be expected as due from His own home. This is the reception given without a claim.<p><span class= "bld">To them that believe on his name</span> repeats the width of the condition, and at the same time explains what receiving Him means. It seems natural to understand the “name” of the only name which meets us in this context, that is, of the <span class= "ital">Logos</span> or Word, the representation of the will, character, nature of God. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>.) To “believe on” is one of St. John’s characteristic words of fuller meaning. To believe is to accept as true; “devils believe and tremble” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-19.htm" title="You believe that there is one God; you do well: the devils also believe, and tremble.">James 2:19</a>). To believe in is to trust in, confide in. To believe on, has the idea of motion to and rest upon: it is here the going forth of the soul upon, and its rest upon, the firm basis of the eternal love of the eternal Spirit revealed in the Word.

Nothing more fully shows the darkness of men's minds, than that when the Light had appeared, there needed a witness to call attention to it. Christ was the true Light; that great Light which deserves to be called so. By his Spirit and grace he enlightens all that are enlightened to salvation; and those that are not enlightened by him, perish in darkness. Christ was in the world when he took our nature upon him, and dwelt among us. The Son of the Highest was here in this lower world. He was in the world, but not of it. He came to save a lost world, because it was a world of his own making. Yet the world knew him not. When he comes as a Judge, the world shall know him. Many say that they are Christ's own, yet do not receive him, because they will not part with their sins, nor have him to reign over them. All the children of God are born again. This new birth is through the word of God as the means, 1Pe 1:23, and by the Spirit of God as the Author. By his Divine presence Christ always was in the world. But now that the fulness of time was come, he was, after another manner, God manifested in the flesh. But observe the beams of his Divine glory, which darted through this veil of flesh. Men discover their weaknesses to those most familiar with them, but it was not so with Christ; those most intimate with him saw most of his glory. Although he was in the form of a servant, as to outward circumstances, yet, in respect of graces, his form was like the Son of God His Divine glory appeared in the holiness of his doctrine, and in his miracles. He was full of grace, fully acceptable to his Father, therefore qualified to plead for us; and full of truth, fully aware of the things he was to reveal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To as many as received him - The great mass; the people; the scribes and Pharisees rejected him. A few in his lifetime received him, and many more after his death. "To receive him," here, means to "believe" on him. This is expressed at the end of the verse.<p>Gave he power - This is more appropriately rendered in the margin by the word "right" or "privilege."

See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. Christians are called sons of God:<p>1. Because they are "adopted" by Him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>.<p>2. Because they are "like Him;" they resemble Him and have His spirit.<p>3. They are united to the Lord Jesus, the Son of God, are regarded by Him as his brethren <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>, and are therefore regarded as the children of the Most High.<p>On his name - This is another way of saying believeth in "him."

From this verse we learn:<p>1. That to be a child of God is a privilege - far more so than to be the child of any human being, though in the highest degree rich, or learned, or honored. Christians are therefore more honored than any other persons.<p>2. God gave them this privilege. It is not by their own works or deserts; it is because God chose to impart this blessing to them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>.<p>3. This favor is given only to those who believe on him. All others are the children of the wicked one, and no one who has not "confidence in God" can be regarded as his child. No parent would acknowledge one for his child, or approve of him, who had no confidence in him, who doubted or denied all he said, and who despised his character. Yet the sinner constantly does this toward God, and he cannot, therefore, be called his Son. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

This is explained, in the latter part of the text, by believing in his name; for faith is a receiving him as the word, and Son of God, as the Messiah, Saviour, and Redeemer; a receiving grace out of his fulness, and every blessing from him, as a justifying righteousness, pardon of sin, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified; for though the generality rejected him, there were some few that received him: <p>to them gave he power to become the sons of God; as such were very early called, in distinction from the children of men, or of the world; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>. To be the sons of God is a very special favour, a great blessing, and high honour: saints indeed are not in so high a sense the sons of God as Christ is; nor in so low a sense as angels and men in common are; nor in such sense as civil magistrates; nor merely by profession of religion; much less by natural descent; but by adopting grace: and in this, Christ, the word, has a concern, as all the three divine persons have. The Father predestinated men to the adoption of children, secures this blessing for them in the covenant of his grace, and puts them among the children, and assigns them a goodly heritage: the Spirit, and who is therefore called the spirit of adoption, discovers and applies this blessing to them, and witnesses to their spirits that they are the children of God: and Christ, the word, or Son of God, not only espoused their persons, and in time assumed their nature, and by the redemption of them opened a way for their reception of the adoption of children; but actually bestows upon them the "power", as it is here called, of becoming the sons of God: by which is meant, not a power of free will to make themselves the sons of God, if they will make use of it; but it signifies the honour and dignity conferred on such persons: so Nonnus calls it, "the heavenly honour"; as indeed, what can be a greater? It is more honourable than to be a son or daughter of the greatest potentate on earth: and it is expressive of its being a privilege; for so it is an undeserved and distinguishing one, and is attended with many other privileges; for such are of God's household and family, and are provided for by him; have liberty of access unto him; are Christ's free men, and are heirs to an incorruptible inheritance. This is a privilege that excels all others, even justification and remission of sins; and is an everlasting one: and it also intends the open right which believers have unto this privilege, and their claim of it: hence it follows, <p>even to them that believe in his name; that is, in himself, in Christ, the word: the phrase is explanative of the former part of the verse, and is a descriptive and manifestative character of the sons of God; for though the elect of God, by virtue of electing grace, and the covenant of grace, are the children of God before faith; and were so considered in the gift of them to Christ, and when he came into the world to gather them together, and save them; and so, antecedent to the Spirit of God, being sent down into their hearts, to make this known to them; yet no man can know his adoption, nor enjoy the comfort of it, or claim his interest in it, until he believes. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> But as many as received him, to them gave he <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> power to become the sons of God, <i>even</i> to them that believe on his name:</span><p>(6) The Son being shut out by the majority of his people, and acknowledged but by a few, regenerates those few by his own strength and power, and receives them into that honour which is common to all the children of God, that is, to be the sons of God.<p>(s) He condescended to give them this power to take them to be his children.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>.

Rather, with Stevens, “to believe and to be begotten of God are two inseparable aspects of the same event or process” (<span class="ital">Johan. Theol.</span>, p. 251). John uses <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span> rather than the Pauline <span class="greekheb">υἱοὺς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θ</span>., because Paul’s view of sonship was governed by the Roman legal process of adopting a son who was not one’s own child: while John’s view is mystical and physical, the begetting of a child by the communication of the very life of God (1 John, <span class="ital">passim</span>). This distinction underlies the characteristic use of <span class="greekheb">υἱός</span> by the one writer and <span class="greekheb">τέκνον</span> by the other (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Westcott, <span class="ital">Epistles of St. John</span>, p. 123). By the reception of Christ as the Incarnate Logos we are enabled to recognise God as our Father and to come into the closest possible relation to Him. Those who thus receive Him are further identified as <span class="greekheb">τοῖς πιστεύουσιν εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ</span>, “those who believe (believers, present participle) in His name”.—<span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν εἴς τινα</span> is the favourite construction with John, and emphasises the object on which the faith rests. Here that object is <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὅνομα αὐτοῦ</span>, the sum of all characteristic qualities which attach to the bearer of the name: “quippe qui credant esse eum id ipsum, quod nomen declarat” (Holtzmann). It is impossible to identify this “name” with the Logos, because Jesus never proclaimed Himself under this name. Other definite names, such as Son of God or Messiah, can here only be proleptic, and it is probably better to leave it indefinite, and understand it in a general sense of those who believed in the self-manifestation of Christ, and were characterised by that belief.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">received</span>] Not the same Greek word as before: this denotes the spontaneous acceptance of the Messiah by <span class="ital">individuals</span>, whether Jews or Gentiles.

John: it occurs about 35 times in the Gospel and 3 times in the First Epistle; elsewhere in N.T. about 10 times. It expresses the very strongest belief; motion to and repose on the object of belief. ‘His Name’ is a frequent phrase in Jewish literature, both O. and N.T. It is not a mere periphrasis. Names were so often significant, given sometimes by God Himself, that a man’s name told not merely <span class="ital">who</span> he was, but <span class="ital">what</span> he was: it was an index of character. So ‘the Name of the Lord’ is not a mere periphrasis for ‘the Lord;’ it suggests His attributes and His relations to us as Lord. Perhaps the name of <span class="ital">Logos</span> is specially meant here; and the meaning would then be to give one’s entire adhesion to Him as the Incarnate Son, the expression of the Will and Nature of God.

All have not perished in their unbelief. Some have received him. The twelfth and thirteenth verses do, indeed, in their full meaning, refer unmistakably to the entire ministry of the living Christ to the end of time; but surely every word of it applies <span class="accented">primarily</span> (though not exclusively) to the whole previous pleadings of the Light and Life - to the ministry of the pre-existing and eternal Logos, and to the privileges and possibilities consequent thereupon. <span class="cmt_word">As many as received him</span>. This phrase is subsequently explained as being identical with "believed in his Name." The simple verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, is less definite than are its compounds with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, used in the previous verses (5, 11). The acceptance is a positive idea, is broader, more manifold, less restricted as to manner of operation, than the negative rejection which took sharp and decisive form. The construction is irregular. We have a <span class="accented">nominativus pendens</span> followed by a clause in the dative; as much as if he had written, "There are, notwithstanding all the rejections, those who received him." To these, the evangelist says, however many or few they may be, <span class="cmt_word">who believe in his Name,</span> he - the subject of the previous sentence - <span class="cmt_word">gave the authority and capability of becoming children of God</span>. Believing in his Name is discriminated from believing him. The construction occurs thirty-five times in the Gospel, and three times in the First Epistle - and the Name here especially present to the writer is the Logos, the full revelation of the essence, character, and activity, of God. John, writing in the close of his life, surveys a glorious company of individuals who, by realizing as true the sum of all the perfections of the manifested Word, by believing in his Name, have also received as a gift the sense of such union to the Son of God that they become alive to the fact that they too are the offspring of God. This realization of the Divine fatherhood, which had been so obscure before, is itself the  origination within them of filial feeling. Thus a new life is begotten and supervenes upon the old life. This new life is a new humanity within the bosom or womb of the old, and so it corresponds with the Pauline doctrine of new creation and of resurrection. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is more than opportunity, and less than (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) power; it is rightful claim (which is itself the gift of God) to become what they were not before, seeing that a Divine generation has begotten them again. They are born from above. The Spirit of the Son has passed into them, and they cry, "Abba, Father." This Divine begetting is still further explained and differentiated from ordinary human life. The writer distinctly repudiates the idea that the condition he speaks of is a consequence of simple birth into this world. This is done in a very emphatic manner (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;</span> here in the masculine, is the well known <span class="accented">constructio ad sensum</span>, and refers to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Who were begotten from God, not from</span> (or, <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>blood</span>. (The plural word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> has been variously rendered by expositors: Augustine regarding it as a reference to the blending of the blood of both sexes in ordinary generation; Meyer, as not different from the singular in meaning, giving numerous passages in the classics where this or an equivalent usage of the plural for the singular occurs. The suggestion of Moulton is more satisfactory - that it points to pride of race, common enough in Israel, but not peculiar to Jews.) John repudiates for this "generation" any connection with mere hereditary privilege. No twice-born Brahmin, no dignified race, no descendant of Abraham, can claim it as such, and the writer further discriminates it, as though he would leave no loophole for escape: <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet from the will of the flesh, nor even from the will of the man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). Some, very erroneously, have supposed that "the flesh" here refers to "woman" in contradistinction to "man," and numerous efforts have been made to point out the threefold distinction. The simplest and most obvious interpretation is that "the will of the flesh" here means the human process of generation on its lower side, and "the will of the man" the higher purposes of the nobler side of human nature, which lead to the same end. Special dignity is conferred by being the son of a special father; but however honoured such might be, as in the case of an Abraham, a David, a Zacharias, such paternity has nothing to do with the sonship of which the evangelist is thinking. Doubtless this triumphant new beginning of humanity can only be found in the full revelation of the name of the incarnate Logos; but surely the primary application of the passage is to the fact that, notwithstanding the stiff-necked rejection of the Logos by the peculiar possession and people of his love, there were, from Abraham to Malachi and to John the Baptist, those who did recognize the Light and live in the love of God. The author of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16.htm">Psalm 16, 17, 23, 25, 103, 119</a>, and a multitude beyond calculation, discerned and received him, walked in the light of the Lord, were kept in perfect peace, found in the Lord their most exceeding joy. "Like as a father pitieth his chihlren, so the Lord pitied them." He nourished and brought up children, and to the extent to which they appreciated his holy Name they therein received as a gift the capability and claim to call him their Father. This was not a question of human fatherhood or hereditary privilege at all, but of gracious exchanges of affection between these children of his love and the Eternal, who had fashioned them in his image and regenerated them by his Holy Spirit. To restrict any element of this passage to conscious faith in the Christ is to repudiate the activity of the Logos and Spirit before the Incarnation, and almost compels a Sabellian interpretation of the Godhead. Even now the grandeur of the biblical doctrine of the Trinity - a doctrine which treats these relations as eternal and universal - compels us to believe that whenever among the sons of men there is a soul which receives the Logos in this light, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> apart from the special revelation of the Logos in the flesh, to such a one he gives the capacity and claim of sonship. John certainly could not mean to imply that there had never been a regenerated soul until he and his fellow disciples accepted their Lord. Up to this point in his argument he has been disclosing the universal and the special operations of the Logos who in the beginning was with God and was God, the Source of all life, the Giver of all light, the veritable Light which shines upon every man, which does more even than that - which made a long continued series of approaches to his own specially instructed and prepared people. Prophecy all through the ages has had a wondrous function to bear witness to the reality of this Light, that all might believe in it, that all might become sons by faith; but, alas darkness, prejudice, depravity, corruption - "darkness" did not apprehend the nature, name, or mystery, of love. And so he proceeds to describe the greatest, the most surprising, supreme energy of the Eternal Logos - that which illustrates, confirms, brings into the most forcible relief, the nature of his personality, and the extent of the obligation under which he has placed the human race; and proves in the most irresistible way, not only the character and nature of God, but the actual condition of humanity. The great extent of the  literature and the imposing controversies which have accumulated over the entirely unique sentence that here fellows render any treatment of it difficult. A volume rather than a page or two is required to exhibit the significance of a verse which is probably the most important collocation of words ever made. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>As many as (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>Denoting individuals, as &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>) signified the nation at large.<p>Received (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The simple verb of the compound &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-7.htm">Galatians 4:7</a>. Except in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-7.htm">Revelation 21:7</a>, which is a quotation, John never uses &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; to describe the relation of Christians to God, since he regards their position not as a result of adoption, but of a new life. Paul, on the other hand, regards the relation from the legal standpoint, as adoption, imparting a new dignity and relation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>).

The word is used by John, sometimes with the dative case simply meaning to believe a person or thing; i.e., to believe that they are true or speak the truth. Thus, to believe the Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-22.htm">John 2:22</a>); believe me (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a>); believe Moses, his writings, my words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-46.htm">John 4:46</a>). At other times with a preposition, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;, into, which is rendered believe in, or believe on. So here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-29.htm">John 6:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-30.htm">John 8:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-10.htm">1 John 5:10</a>. See the two contrasted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-29.htm">John 6:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-30.htm">John 6:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-30.htm">John 8:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-10.htm">1 John 5:10</a>. To believe in, or on, is more than mere acceptance of a statement. It is so to accept a statement or a person as to rest upon them, to trust them practically; to draw upon and avail one's self of all that is offered to him in them. Hence to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ is not merely to believe the facts of His historic life or of His saving energy as facts, but to accept Him as Savior, Teacher, Sympathizer, Judge; to rest the soul upon Him for present and future salvation, and to accept and adopt His precepts and example as binding upon the life.<p>Name (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>. Expressing the sum of the qualities which mark the nature or character of a person. To believe in the name of Jesus Christ the Son of God, is to accept as true the revelation contained in that title.
