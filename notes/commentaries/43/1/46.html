Observe the objection Nathanael made. All who desire to profit by the word of God, must beware of prejudices against places, or denominations of men. They should examine for themselves, and they will sometimes find good where they looked for none. Many people are kept from the ways of religion by the unreasonable prejudices they conceive. The best way to remove false notions of religion, is to make trial of it. In Nathanael there was no guile. His profession was not hypocritical. He was not a dissembler, nor dishonest; he was a sound character, a really upright, godly man. Christ knows what men are indeed. Does He know us? Let us desire to know him. Let us seek and pray to be Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile; truly Christians, approved of Christ himself. Some things weak, imperfect, and sinful, are found in all, but hypocrisy belongs not to a believer's character. Jesus witnessed what passed when Nathanael was under the fig-tree. Probably he was then in fervent prayer, seeking direction as to the Hope and Consolation of Israel, where no human eye observed him. This showed him that our Lord knew the secrets of his heart. Through Christ we commune with, and benefit by the holy angels; and things in heaven and things on earth are reconciled and united together.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Can any good thing ... - The character of Nazareth was proverbially bad. To be a Galilean or a Nazarene was an expression of decided contempt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>. Nathanael asked, therefore, whether it was possible that the Messiah should come from a place proverbially wicked. This was a mode of judging in the case not uncommon. It is not by examining evidence, but by prejudice. Many persons suffer their minds to be filled with prejudice against religion, and then pronounce at once without examination. They refuse to examine the subject, for they have set it down that it cannot be true. It matters not where a teacher comes from, or what is the place of his birth, provided he be authorized of God and qualified for his work.<p>Come and see - This was the best way to answer Nathanael. He did not sit down to reason with him, or speculate about the possibility that a good thing could come from Nazareth; but he asked him to go and examine for himself, to see the Lord Jesus, to hear him converse, to lay aside his prejudice, and to judge from a fair and candid personal inquiry. So we should beseech sinners to lay aside their prejudices against religion, and "to be Christians," and thus make trial for themselves. If men can be persuaded to come to Jesus, all their petty and foolish objections against religion will vanish. They will be satisfied from their own experience that it is true, and in this way only will they ever be satisfied. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>46. any good out of Nazareth&#8212;remembering Bethlehem, perhaps, as Messiah's predicted birthplace, and Nazareth having no express prophetic place at all, besides being in no repute.

Taking notice of, and laying hold on what Philip said, that he was of Nazareth, which at once stumbled, and prejudiced him against Jesus being the Messiah; knowing very well that Bethlehem was to be the place of his birth: <p>can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? The whole country of Galilee was had in contempt with the Jews; but Nazareth was so mean a place, that it seems it was even despised by its neighbours, by the Galilaeans themselves; for Nathanael was a Galilean, that said these words. It was so miserable a place that he could hardly think that any sort of good thing, even any worldly good thing, could come from thence; and it was so wicked, as appears from their murderous designs upon our Lord, that he thought no good man could arise from hence; and still less, any prophet, any person of great note; and still least of all, that that good thing, or person, the Messiah, should spring from it: so that his objection, and prejudice, proceeded not only upon the oracle in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which points out Bethlehem as the birthplace of the Messiah; but upon the wickedness, and meanness, and obscurity of Nazareth, <p>Philip saith unto him, come and see; who though he might not be master of this point, and knew not how to solve this difficulty, and remove this prejudice from Nathanael's mind, yet persuades him to go with him to Jesus; who, he doubted not, would give him full satisfaction in this, and all other points; and then it would most clearly appear to him, as it had done to him, that he was the true Messiah.

Very recently, however, Hilgenfeld has supposed that the name answers to the Matthias who was appointed in the place of Judas (<span class="ital">N. T. extra canon</span>. IV. p. 105). Schleiermacher, <span class="ital">L. J.</span> p. 368, considers it very doubtful whether Nathanael belonged to the twelve at all. Chrysostom, Augustine, and others, long ago denied that he did, but this is already assumed in the “<span class="ital">duae viae</span>” (Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">N. T. extra canon</span>. IV.). According to Spaeth, in Hilgenfeld’s <span class="ital">Zeitschrift</span>, 1868, p. 168 ff., Nathanael is to be taken as a <span class="ital">symbolical</span> name, invented by the writer, under which the <span class="ital">Apostle John himself</span> is said to be represented. The author of the Appendix, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-2.htm" title="There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.">John 21:2</a>, where Nathanael is expressly <span class="ital">distinguished</span> from the sons of Zebedee, is said to have made a <span class="ital">mistake</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-46.htm" title="And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?

Philip in turn finds Nathanael, probably on the road from the Bethany ford homewards. Nathanael is probably the same person as is spoken of in the Synoptical Gospels as Bartholomew, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, Bar Tolmai, son of Ptolemy. This is usually inferred from the following: (1) Both here and in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-2.htm" title="There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.">John 21:2</a> he is classed with apostles; (2) in the lists of apostles given in the Synoptical Gospels Bartholomew is coupled with Philip; (3) while Nathanael is never mentioned by the Synoptists, Bartholomew is not mentioned by John. The two names might quite well belong to one man, Bartholomew being a patronymic. Nathanael means “God’s gift,” Theodore, or, like Augustine’s son, Adeodatus. Philip announces the discovery in the words <span class="greekheb">ὃν ἔγραψεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">Ναζαρέτ</span>. On which Calvin remarks: “Quam tenuis fuerit modulus fidei in Philippo hinc patet, quod de Christo quatuor verba profari nequit, quin duos crassos errores permisceat. Facit ilium filium Joseph, et patriam Nazareth falso illi assignat.” This is too stringent. He draws the conclusion that where there is a sincere purpose to do good and to proclaim Christ, success will follow even where there is error. Nazareth lies due west from the south end of the Sea of Galilee, and about midway between it and the Mediterranean.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">46</span>. <span class="ital">Can there any good thing</span>, &c.] All Galileans were despised for their want of culture, their rude dialect, and contact with Gentiles. They were to the Jews what Bœotians were to the Athenians. But here it is a Galilean who reproaches Nazareth in particular. Apart from the Gospels we know nothing to the discredit of Nazareth; neither in O.T. nor in Josephus is it mentioned; but what we are told of the people by the Evangelists is mostly bad. Christ left them and preferred to dwell at Capernaum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-13.htm" title="And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:">Matthew 4:13</a>); He could do very little among them, ‘because of their unbelief’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-58.htm" title="And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.">Matthew 13:58</a>), which was such as to make Him marvel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm" title="And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.">Mark 6:6</a>); and once they tried to kill Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-29.htm" title="And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill where on their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong.">Luke 4:29</a>). S. Augustine would omit the question. Nathanael ‘who knew the Scriptures excellently well, when he heard the name Nazareth, was filled with hope, and said, From Nazareth something good can come.’ But this is not probable. Possibly he meant no more than ‘Can any good thing come out of despised Galilee?’ Nazareth being in Galilee.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Come and see</span>] The best cure for ill-founded prejudice. Philip shews the depth of his own conviction in suggesting this test, which seems to have been in harmony with the practical bent of his own mind. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-21.htm" title="The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.">John 12:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-8.htm" title="Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.">John 14:8</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-46.htm" title="And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?

Nathanael’s question is however more modest and cautious, than if he categorically denied [that anything good could come from Galilee].

The "good thing" may, however, be the contrast between the unimportance of the place in the political or religious history of the people, as compared with Jerusalem, Tiberias, Jericho, Bethlehem. It is never mentioned in the Old Testament or in Josephus. Nathanael may have known its mediocrity, and have been startled by the possibility of a carpenter's son, in a spot utterly undistinguished, being the Messiah of whom their sacred writers spoke. "Despised Nazareth" is a phrase rather due to the splendour of the flower that grew upon its barren soil, and became contrasted afterwards with the unlooked for glory and claims of the Nazarene. <span class="cmt_word">Philip saith unto him, Come and see</span>. This was his strongest argument. To look upon him is to believe. He had much more to learn in after days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-8.htm">John 14:8, 9</a>). At this moment he and Nathanael stood on ground consecrated by ancient history, and thrilling with the thunder peals of the Baptist, mazed and wistful from much longing, thinking of the union between heaven and earth which had been revealed in the experience of ancient prophets, dwelling on the careers of Israel, Moses, and Elijah in their rapt transports, musing under fig trees or the like, and longing for the great King. He may naturally have reasoned on this wise: "Can it be true that the Christ, the King of Israel, the Lord of the temple, the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, is indistinguishable from the rest of mankind in this very crowd? Would that I too might see in him, as John has done, some vision of the opened heaven, that I too might hear some unmistakable  voice!" If these were the musings of Nathanael - and surely there is not a trace of unreason in such meditations in the breast of a disciple of the Baptist - the conversation which follows is more easy to understand. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Come out of Nazareth (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c4; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Literally, "be out of;" a characteristic expression of John. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm">John 4:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-22.htm">John 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm">John 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-19.htm">John 15:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-38.htm">John 18:38</a>, etc. It means more than to come out of: rather to come out of as that which is of; to be identified with something so as to come forth bearing its impress, moral or otherwise. See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31</a> : "He that is of the earth is of the earth;" i.e., partakes of its quality. Compare Christ's words to Nicodemus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-6.htm">John 3:6</a>), and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-47.htm">1 Corinthians 15:47</a>.<p>In the Greek order, out of Nazareth stands first in the sentence as expressing the prominent thought in Nathanael's mind, surprise that Jesus should have come from Nazareth, a poor village, even the name of which does not occur in the Old Testament. Contrary to the popular explanation, there is no evidence that Nazareth was worse than other places, beyond the fact of the violence offered to Jesus by its people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/4-28.htm">Luke 4:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-29.htm">Luke 4:29</a>), and their obstinate unbelief in Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a>). It was a proverb, however, that no prophet was to come from Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>). </body></html>
