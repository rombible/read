The paschal lamb, in the shedding and sprinkling of its blood, the roasting and eating of its flesh, and all the other circumstances of the ordinance, represented the salvation of sinners by faith in Christ. And the lambs sacrificed every morning and evening, can only refer to Christ slain as a sacrifice to redeem us to God by his blood. John came as a preacher of repentance, yet he told his followers that they were to look for the pardon of their sins to Jesus only, and to his death. It agrees with God's glory to pardon all who depend on the atoning sacrifice of Christ. He takes away the sin of the world; purchases pardon for all that repent and believe the gospel. This encourages our faith; if Christ takes away the sin of the world, then why not my sin? He bore sin for us, and so bears it from us. God could have taken away sin, by taking away the sinner, as he took away the sin of the old world; but here is a way of doing away sin, yet sparing the sinner, by making his Son sin, that is, a sin-offering, for us. See Jesus taking away sin, and let that cause hatred of sin, and resolutions against it. Let us not hold that fast, which the Lamb of God came to take away. To confirm his testimony concerning Christ, John declares the appearance at his baptism, in which God himself bore witness to him. He saw and bare record that he is the Son of God. This is the end and object of John's testimony, that Jesus was the promised Messiah. John took every opportunity that offered to lead people to Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The same said ... - This was the sign by which he was to know the Messiah. He was to see the Spirit descending like a dove and abiding on him. It does not follow, however, that he had no intimation before this that Jesus was the Christ, but it means that by this he should know it infallibly. From <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-14</a>, it seems that John supposed, before the baptism of Jesus, that he claimed to be the Messiah, and, that he believed it; but the infallible, certain testimony in the case was the descent of the Holy Spirit on him at his baptism.<p>That this is the Son of God - This was distinctly declared by a voice from heaven at his baptism, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>.

As He drew near for baptism one day, the last of all the crowd, the spirit of the Baptist heaving under a divine presentiment that the moment had at length arrived, and an air of unwonted serenity and dignity, not without traits, probably, of the family features, appearing in this Stranger, the Spirit said to him as to Samuel of his youthful type, "Arise, anoint Him, for this is He!" (1Sa 16:12). But the sign which he was told to expect was the visible descent of the Spirit upon Him as He emerged out of the baptismal water. Then, catching up the voice from heaven, "he saw and bare record that this is the Son of God."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And I knew him not; </span> I was a stranger to him; I knew him in a sense, when I leaped in my mother’s womb, upon his mother’s coming to see my mother, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-41.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:">Luke 1:41</a></span>; but that (as impressions made upon infants use to do) wore off.

John’s recognition of Jesus as the Messiah (whom he had not before known as such) rested upon a revelation previously made to him with this intent; and this he now states, solemnly repeating, however, the declaration of his own ignorance (<span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ οὐκ ᾔδειν αὐτόν</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνος</span>] in emphatic contrast with his own reflection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἶπεν</span>] <span class="ital">i.e</span>. by <span class="ital">express revelation</span>.

By it John was referred to some outwardly visible <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἴδῃς</span>) of the Spirit, in a general way, without <span class="ital">any definition of its form</span>. He was to <span class="ital">see</span> it descending, and this descent <span class="ital">took place</span> in the form of a <span class="ital">dove</span>, and after that divine intimation there was no room for doubt.

This is not expressly <span class="ital">stated</span> in the divine declaration, but John could not fail so to understand it, because, being sent to <span class="ital">baptize</span>, he would naturally expect the appearance of the promised sign <span class="ital">while fulfilling his mission;</span> comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a>. He therefore describes the giver of the revelation as <span class="greekheb">ὁ πέμψας με</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and the evangelist puts the statement in the conditional form: <span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ὃν ἂν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">i.e</span>., according to the connection of the narrative: “<span class="ital">When, in the fulfilment of this your mission, you shall see the Spirit descending upon one of those whom thou baptizest, this is He,</span>” etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγίῳ</span>] by communicating it to those who believe upon Him. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>. The designation of this communication as a <span class="ital">baptism</span> very naturally arose from its close relation to the work of the Baptist’s mission (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-8.htm" title="I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.">Mark 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-16.htm" title="John answered, saying to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I comes, the lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:">Luke 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-5.htm" title="For John truly baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.">Acts 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-16.htm" title="Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 11:16</a>), because the gift of the Spirit, according to the prophetic figure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-1.htm" title="For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,">Joel 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm" title="For I will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods on the dry ground: I will pour my spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring:">Isaiah 44:3</a>), had been promised under the form of an <span class="ital">outpouring</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a>). The contrast itself distinctly sets before us the difference between the two baptisms: the one was a preparation for the Messianic salvation by <span class="greekheb">μετάνοια</span>; the other, an introduction thereto by the divine principle of life and salvation, the communication of which presupposes the forgiveness of sins (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-4.htm" title="John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.">Mark 1:4</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>. <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ οὐκ ᾔδειν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνός μοι εἶπεν</span>. Because of the importance of the identification of the Messiah the Baptist reiterates that his proclamation of Jesus was not a private idea for which he alone was responsible. On the contrary, He who had sent him to baptise had given him this sign by which to recognise the Christ.—<span class="greekheb">ἐφʼ ὃν ἂν ἴδῃς</span> … <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι ἁγίῳ</span>. Lk. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-16.htm" title="John answered, saying to them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but one mightier than I comes, the lace of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:">Luke 3:16</a>) adds <span class="greekheb">καὶ πυρί</span>, which occasions the well-known utterance in <span class="ital">Ecce Homo</span>: “Baptism means cleansing, and fire means warmth. How can warmth cleanse? The answer is that moral warmth does cleanse. No heart is pure that is not passionate; no virtue is safe that is not enthusiastic. And such an enthusiastic virtue Christ was to introduce.” In affirming that the Christ baptises with the Holy Spirit, and that this is what distinguishes the Christ, the Baptist steps on to grouud where his affirmations can be tested by experience. This is the fundamental article of the Christian creed. Has Christ power to make men holy? History gives the answer. The essence of the Holy Spirit is communication: Jesus being the Christ, the anointed with the Spirit, must communicate it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>. <span class="ital">And I knew him not</span>] Or, as before, <span class="ital">I</span> <span class="bld">also</span> <span class="ital">knew Him not</span>. The Baptist again protests, that but for a special revelation he was as ignorant as others that Jesus was the Messiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he that sent me</span>] The special mission of a Prophet.
