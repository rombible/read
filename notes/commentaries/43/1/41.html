To have stated this would have been to break through the personal reserve which he imposed upon himself.

Whatever communion there is between our souls and Christ, it is he who begins the discourse. He asked, What seek ye? The question Jesus put to them, we should all put to ourselves when we begin to follow Him, What do we design and desire? In following Christ, do we seek the favour of God and eternal life? He invites them to come without delay. Now is the accepted time, 2Co 6:2. It is good for us to be where Christ is, wherever it be. We ought to labour for the spiritual welfare of those related to us, and seek to bring them to Him. Those who come to Christ, must come with a fixed resolution to be firm and constant to him, like a stone, solid and stedfast; and it is by his grace that they are so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He first findeth - He found him and "told him about Jesus" before he brought him to Jesus.<p>We have found the Messias - They had learned from the testimony of John, and now had been more fully convinced from conversation with Jesus, that he was the Messiah. The word "Messiah," or "Messias," is Hebrew, and means the same as the Greek word "Christ," "anointed." See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. From the conduct of Andrew we may learn that it is the nature of religion to desire that others may possess it. It does not lead us to monopolize it or to hide it under a bushel, but it seeks that others also may be brought to the Saviour. It does not "wait" for them to come, but it goes "for" them; it seeks them out, and tells them that a Saviour is found. Young converts should "seek" their friends and neighbors, and tell them of a Saviour; and not only their relatives, but all others as far as possible, that all may come to Jesus and be saved. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. have found the Messias&#8212;The previous preparation of their simple hearts under the Baptist's ministry, made quick work of this blessed conviction, while others hesitated till doubt settled into obduracy. So it is still.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It should seem that both the disciples (after their converse with Christ at the place where he lodged) went together to look for Peter, Andrew’s brother. Andrew first found him, and tells him (with great joy) that he and that other disciple had <span class="ital">found the</span> <span class="ital">Messiah, </span> prophesied of by Daniel, and in the expectation of whom the disciples and the Jews lived. The term <span class="ital">Messiah</span> in Hebrew is the same with <span class="ital">Christ</span> in Greek, and both signify the same with <span class="ital">Anointed</span> in English. The article in this place is emphatic, not merely prepositive, as in other places, but signifying, that Anointed; for other kings, and priests, and prophets were also anointed, and God’s people are called anointed; but he was anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows, having the Spirit not given him by measure. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He first findeth his own brother Simon,.... Either before the other disciple, or before he found any other person: after he and the other disciple departed from Christ, being affected with the grace bestowed upon him, and his heart warm with the conversation he had had with him, and transported with joy at finding the Messiah, goes in all haste in search of his relations, friends, and acquaintance, to communicate what he had seen and heard, in order to bring them to the knowledge of the same; for such is the nature of grace, it is very communicative, and those that have it, are very desirous that all others should be partakers of it: and the first person he lighted on was Simon, who was afterwards called Peter, who was his own brother; not a brother-in-law, but his own brother, by father and mother's side, and so dear unto him by the ties of nature and blood: <p>and saith unto him; with all eagerness imaginable, and in a rapture of joy: <p>we have found the Messias; I, and a fellow disciple have had the Messiah, so often foretold by the prophets, and so long expected by our fathers, pointed out to us; and we have followed him, and have had conversation with him, and are well assured he is that illustrious person: <p>which is, being interpreted, the Christ; which, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38</a>, are the words of the evangelist, and not Andrew, and are therefore left out in the Syriac version; the word Messiah needing no interpretation in that language, and which was the language in which Andrew spoke. This name, Messiah, was well known among the Jews, for that who was promised, and they expected as a Saviour and Redeemer; though it is not very often mentioned in the books of the Old Testament, chiefly in the following places, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>; but is very much used in the Chaldee paraphrases: Elias Levita (g) says, he found it in more than fifty verses; and Buxtorf (h) has added others to them, and the word appears in "seventy one" places, which he takes notice of, and are worthy of regard; for they show the sense of the ancient synagogue, concerning the passages of the Old Testament, respecting the Messiah: this Hebrew word is interpreted by the Greek word, "Christ"; and both signify "anointed", and well agree with the person to whom they belong, to which there is an allusion in Sol 1:3, "thy name is as ointment poured forth": he is so called, because he was anointed from everlasting, to be prophet, priest, and king; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a> <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a>, and he was anointed as man, with the oil of gladness, with the graces of the Spirit, without measure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>. And it is from him the saints receive the anointing, or grace in measure; and are from him called Christians, and are really anointed ones; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm">1 John 2:27</a>, hence it is a name precious to the saints, and savoury to them. These words were delivered by Andrew, in a very exulting strain, expressing great joy; as indeed what can be greater joy to a sensible soul, than to find Christ? which in a spiritual sense, is to have a clear sight of him by faith, to go unto him, and lay hold on him, as the only Saviour and Redeemer: who is to be found in the Scriptures of truth, which testify of him; in the promises of grace, which are full of him and in the Gospel, of which he is the sum and substance; and in the ordinances of it, where he shows himself; for he is not to be found by the light of nature, or by carnal reason, nor by the law of Moses, but by means of the Gospel, and the Spirit of God attending that, as a spirit of wisdom and revelation, in the knowledge of him: and happy are those souls that find Christ under his direction; for they find life, spiritual and eternal, in him; a justifying righteousness; free and full pardon of their sins; spiritual food for their souls; and peace, comfort, joy, and rest, and eternal glory: wherefore this must needs be matter of joy unto them, since such a finding is a rich one, a pearl of great price, riches durable and unsearchable; and which a man that has found, would not part with for all the world; but parts with all he has for it; and is what can never be lost again; and, particularly to two sorts of persons, finding Christ must give a peculiar pleasure, and an inexpressible joy; to such as are under a sense of sin and damnation, and to such who have been under desertion. The phrase of "finding" a person, twice used in this text, and hereafter in some following verses, is frequent in Talmudic and Rabbinic writings; as <p>&acirc;&#128;&#156;he went, , "and found him with Rab" (i). <p>(g) Prefat ad Methurgemen, &amp; in voce  (h) Lexicon Talmud p. 1268.

Andrew is <span class="ital">the first</span> (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῶΤΟς</span></span></span>, not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῶΤΟΝ</span></span></span>, an inelegant change adopted by Lachmann, after A. B. M. X. <span class="greekheb">א</span> **) who finds his brother. John, however, does not say that he also sought <span class="ital">his</span> brother <span class="ital">James</span>, found him, and brought him to Jesus; and this is in keeping with the delicate reserve which prevents him from naming either himself or those belonging to him (even the name of James does not occur in the Gospel). Still this may be clearly seen from the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῶΤΟς</span></span></span>, and is confirmed by the narrative of the Synoptics, in so far that both James and John are represented as being called at the same time by Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-19.htm" title="And when he had gone a little farther there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.">Mark 1:19</a> and parallels).

The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ἼΔΙΟΝ</span></span></span> is against this; as it neither here nor elsewhere (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm" title="Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.">John 5:18</a>) occurs as a mere possessive (against Lücke, Maier, De Wette, and others), but in opposition to that which is foreign. Any antithetic relation to the <span class="ital">spiritual</span> brotherhood in which John as well as Andrew stood to Simon (Hengstenberg), is quite remote from the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εὑρήκαμεν</span>] placed emphatically at the beginning of the clause, and presupposing the feeling of <span class="ital">anxious desire</span> excited by the Baptist.

Jesus, as the Searcher of hearts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-25.htm" title="And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.">John 2:25</a>; Weiss, Lehrbegr. p. 263), sees in him one who should hereafter be called to be the <span class="ital">rock</span> of the church, and calls him by the <span class="ital">name</span> which he was henceforth to bear as His disciple (not first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm" title="And I say also to you, That you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.">Matthew 16:18</a>, as Luthardt thinks).

Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm" title="And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed.">Genesis 32:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm" title="And God said to him, Your name is Jacob: your name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be your name: and he called his name Israel.">Genesis 35:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm" title="Neither shall your name any more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made you.">Genesis 17:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Σὺ εἶ Σίμων</span> is not, as Ewald thinks, a question; and there is no ground whatever for supposing that Jesus <span class="ital">immediately</span> recognised him (Cyril, Chrysostom, Augustine, Aretius, Maldonatus, Cornelius a Lapide, Bengel, Luthardt, and many, comp. Strauss), for Andrew introduced his brother to Jesus. Grotius and Paulus[123] give arbitrary explanations of the reading <span class="greekheb">Ἰωνᾶ</span>, but see the critical notes. For the rest, we must not say, with Hilgenfeld, “Peter here <span class="ital">attains</span> the pre-eminence of the first called disciple;” but Peter is first <span class="ital">given</span> this pre-eminence in the synoptical accounts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Matthew 4:18</a> and parallels); the personal recollection of John, however, must take precedence of these. See especially the note following <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[122] John’s use here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm" title="The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.">John 4:25</a> of <span class="greekheb">τὸν Μεσσίαν</span> (משיה) is accounted for by the depicting of the scene exactly as it occurred; whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-20.htm" title="And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.">John 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a>, when he simply writes historically, he uses the ordinary translation <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span>. The genre picture is specially minute; so here. According to Baur, N. T. Theol. p. 393, the author has given an antiquarian notice, as it were, of this Hebrew name which occurs nowhere else in the N. T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[123] The fantastic play upon the words in Lange’s <span class="ital">L. J.</span> II. 469, is of this sort. He renders: “Now thou art the son of the timid dove of the rock; in future shalt thou be called the sheltering rock of the dove (the church).” According to the true reading of the passage, the name of Peter’s father contained in <span class="greekheb">Βαριωνά</span> which occurs in Matthew, must be regarded as an abbreviation for <span class="ital">John</span>, and has nothing whatever to do with <span class="ital">dove</span>. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἦν Ἀνδρέας</span> … <span class="greekheb">Σίμωνος</span>.

John’s characteristic reserve about himself. Both disciples hurry to tell their own brothers the good tidings, that the Messiah has been found: S. Andrew finds <span class="ital">his</span> brother <span class="ital">first</span>, and afterwards S. John finds <span class="ital">his</span>; but we are left to infer the latter point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>S.

Hengstenberg, De Wette, and others have explained the curious word "first," as though both the unnamed disciple and Andrew had gone together to search out Simon, and that Andrew had been the first of the two to be successful. This would leave the <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> less satisfactorily accounted for than the simple supposition that each of the disciples started in different directions to find "his own" brother, and that Andrew was more fortunate than his companion. The two pairs of brothers are frequently mentioned as being together. James and John, Andrew and Simon, are partners on the lake of Galilee in their fishing business, and are finally called into full discipleship and apostolate after the visit to Jerusalem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-19.htm">Mark 1:19, 11</a>). The four are specially mentioned as being together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>), so that it is not unreasonable to suggest that when Andrew first sought "his own" brother Simon, John also sought for "his own" brother James. It is worthy of note that the evangelist never mentions his own name, nor that of James, nor that of their mother Salome, although he does imply their presence. Andrew <span class="cmt_word">saith to him</span> (Simon), <span class="cmt_word">We have found the Messias</span> - the article is omitted, as <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is merely the translation of" Messiah" - (<span class="cmt_word">which</span>, adds the evangelist, <span class="cmt_word">is, being interpreted, Christ</span>). Andrew is described on two additional occasions as bringing others to Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-8.htm">John 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-22.htm">John 12:22</a>). Here the rapidity and depth of his convictions are noted. The writer's own impression is implied rather than given. He hides his own faith under the bolder and more explicit utterance of his friend. This was the result upon the mind of two disciples of the first conference with Jesus. Marvellous enough that such a thought should have possessed them, however imperfect their ideas were as yet concerning the Christ! The <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> implies that they had long been waiting for the Consolation of Israel, looking for his coming, seeking his appearing. "We have sought," they say, "and we have found." A more wonderful <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> than that of  Archimedes. The plural does not necessitate the presence of John, though it does suggest the agreement of Andrew and his friend in the same august conclusion. What sense of Divine things must have come from the words and looks of Jesus! He who produced such impression on the Baptist as that which the four evangelists report, had done even more with the susceptible spirits of his two disciples. The Baptist never actually called Jesus "the Christ." But when he had testified to the pre-existing glory, the heavenly origin, the sublime functions of the great <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and by special revelation on his forewarned spirit had declared that he was the Son of God, the Lamb of God, and the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost and fire: what must not the inference be when his two disciples came into yet closer and more intimate relations with Jesus? The Jewish idea of "Messiah" (<span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, only occurring here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>), equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, Aramaized form, the <span class="accented">stat. emphat</span>, of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span> (Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>); cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> (Kautzsch, 'Gram. des Bib. Aram.,' p. 10), was the term used among all classes to denote One who should, as anointed by God, fulfil the functions of Prophet, Priest and King, who should realize the splendid visions of the ancient prophecies, and combine in himself a wonderful exhibition of Divine majesty and even of awful suffering. We see that the Baptist understood what was meant by the title, but denied its applicability to himself. The Samaritans believe in a coming Prophet and Saviour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25, 29</a>). The people believe that Messiah will work miracles, that he will be born in Bethlehem, that he will abide forever, that he would prove to be the Son of God. The King Messiah is a pre-existing power and presence in their past history. He will come in the clouds, and reign forever and ever (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-26.htm">John 7:26, 31</a> and John 7:42; John 12:34). According to W&uuml;nsche ('Neue Beitrage zurerlauterung der Ev., aus Talmud und Midrasch,' pp. 499, 500), the Talmud ('Pesachim,' 54, and 'Nedavim,' 39) declares that Messias, or his Name, was one of the seven things created before the world; and Midrasch ('Schemoth,' par. 19) on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a> declares that the King Messias was the Firstborn of God. The more spiritual ideas of John the Baptist have prepared the two disciples to see, even in the travel-stained, lowly Man, "the Messiah." Of course, their idea of Messiah and their idea of Jesus would suffer wonderful development, and be harmonized and blended into a sublime unity by later instructions; but they had made this great discovery, and hastened to impart it. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He first findeth (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., findeth first.
