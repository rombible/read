Yet it is more than a re-statement. We have arrived at the thought that the Word was one in nature with God. From this higher point of view, the steps below us are more clearly seen. The Word was God; the eternal pre-existence and personality are included in the thought.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 The plainest reason why the Son of God is called the Word, seems to be, that as our words explain our minds to others, so was the Son of God sent in order to reveal his Father's mind to the world. What the evangelist says of Christ proves that he is God. He asserts, His existence in the beginning; His coexistence with the Father. The Word was with God. All things were made by him, and not as an instrument. Without him was not any thing made that was made, from the highest angel to the meanest worm. This shows how well qualified he was for the work of our redemption and salvation. The light of reason, as well as the life of sense, is derived from him, and depends upon him. This eternal Word, this true Light shines, but the darkness comprehends it not. Let us pray without ceasing, that our eyes may be opened to behold this Light, that we may walk in it; and thus be made wise unto salvation, by faith in Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The same - The Word, or the &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Logos.<p>Was in the beginning with God - This seems to be a repetition of what was said in the first verse; but it is stated over again to "guard the doctrine," and to prevent the possibility of a mistake. John had said that he existed before the creation, and that he was "with God;" but he had not said in the first verse "that the union with God existed in the beginning." He now expresses that idea, and assures us that that union was not one which was commenced in time, and which might be, therefore, a mere union of feeling, or a compact, like that between any other beings, but was one which existed in eternity, and which was therefore a union of nature or essence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. The same, &c.&#8212;See what property of the Word the stress is laid upon&#8212;His eternal distinctness, in unity, from God&#8212;the Father (Joh 1:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These words of the evangelist are a further confirmation and explication of what the evangelist had said before; asserting the eternity of the Son, and his relation to the Father, and oneness of essence with the Father. Whether the evangelist, forewarned by the Spirit of God, did add this repetition to forearm Christians against those errors which did afterward trouble the church, I cannot say; but certain it is, that these words do effectually confute the Eunomians, who distinguished between the Word which in the beginning was with God, and that Word by which all things were made; and the Arians, who make the Father to have existed before the Son; as also the Anomians, who would make the Father and the Son diverse both in nature and will. Some others make this verse a transition to <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4</a></span>, and the sense to be, This same was not manifest to the world from the beginning of the world, but was with God until he came to be manifested in the flesh: thus, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1Jo 1:2</a></span>, it is said, he <span class="ital">was with the Father, and was manifested unto us.</span> He <span class="ital">was manifested in the flesh, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The same was in the beginning with God.

Not a mere repetition of what has been said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>. There John has said that the Word was in the beginning and also that He was with God: here he indicates that these two characteristics existed contemporaneously. “He was in the beginning with God.” He wishes also to emphasise this in view of what he is about to tell. In the beginning He was with God, afterwards, in time, He came to be with man.

The three weighty truths, put dividedly in the preceding verse, are repeated and brought together in one in this verse. He, the Logos, who was God, was in the beginning, and was with God. A remarkable antithesis, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>, as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-1.htm" title="My little children, these things write I to you, that you sin not.

The previous statements are thus stringently enforced, and, notwithstanding their tendency to diverge, are once more bound into a new, unified, and emphatic utterance. Thus the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of the following sentences is charged with the sublime fulness of meaning which is involved in the three utterances of ver. 1. The first clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> declared that the Logos preceded the origination of all things, was the eternal ground of the world; the second <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> asserted his unique personality, so that he stands over against the eternal God, in mutual communion with the Absolute and Eternal One; the third clause <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> maintains further that the Logos was not a second God, nor merely Divine (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) or God-like, nor is he described as proceeding out of or from God (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), nor is he to be called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "the God absolute," as opposed to all his manifestations; but the Logos is said to be <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">God"</span> - <span class="accented">God</span> in his nature and being. This second verse reasserts the eternal <span class="accented">relation</span> of such a personality "with God," and prepares the way for the statements of the following verses. The unity of the Logos and Theos might easily be supposed to reduce the distinction between them to subjective relations. The second verse emphasizes the objective validity of the relation. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The same (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Literally, this one; the one first named; the Word.<p>Was in the beginning with God<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a> the elements of this statement have been given separately: the Word, the eternal being of the Word, and his active communion with God. Here they are combined, and with new force. This same Word not only was coeternal with God in respect of being (&#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;, was), but was eternally in active communion with Him (in the beginning with God: &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;,&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;): "not simply the Word with God, but God with God" (Moulton). Notice that here &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; has the article, as in the second proposition, where God is spoken of absolutely. In the third proposition, the Word was God, the article was omitted because &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; described the nature of the Word and did not identify his person. Here, as in the second proposition, the Word is placed in personal relation to God.<p>This verse forms the transition point from the discussion of the personal being of the Word to His manifestation in creation. If it was this same Word, and no other, who was Himself God, and who, from all eternity, was in active communion with God, then the statement follows naturally that all things were created through Him, thus bringing the essential nature of the Word and His manifestation in creation into connection. As the idea of the Word involves knowledge and will, wisdom and force, the creative function is properly His. Hence His close relation to created things, especially to man, prepares the way for His incarnation and redeeming work. The connection between creation and redemption is closer than is commonly apprehended. It is intimated in the words of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-4.htm">Isaiah 46:4</a>), "I have made, and I will bear." Redemption, in a certain sense, grows out of creation. Because God created man in His own image, He would restore him to that image. Because God made man, He loves him, educates him, bears with him carries on the race on the line of His infinite patience, is burdened with its perverseness and blindness, and expresses and effectuates all this in the incarnation and redemptive work of Jesus Christ. God is under the stress of the parental instinct (humanly speaking) to redeem man. </body></html>
