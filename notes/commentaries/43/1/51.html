They are always spoken by our Lord, and connected with some deeper truth, to which they direct attention. They represent, in a reduplicated form, the Hebrew “Amen,” which is common in the Old Testament as an adverb, and twice occurs doubled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-22.htm" title="And this water that causes the curse shall go into your bowels, to make your belly to swell, and your thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.">Numbers 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-6.htm" title="And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.">Nehemiah 8:6</a>). In the Hebraic style of the Apocalypse the word is a proper name of “the faithful and true witness” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14</a>).,<p><span class= "bld">I say unto you . . . ye shall see.</span>—The earlier words have been addressed to Nathanael. The truth expressed in these holds for all disciples, and is spoken to all who were then present—to Andrew and John and Peter and James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>) and Philip, as well as to Nathanael.<p><span class= "bld">Hereafter</span> is omitted by several ancient authorities, including the Sinaitic and Vatican MSS., but there is early evidence for the insertion, and as the omission removes a difficulty in the interpretation, it is probably to be traced to this source. If retained, the better rendering is, <span class= "ital">henceforth, from this time onwards.</span><p><span class= "bld">Heaven opened.</span>—More exactly, <span class= "ital">the heaven opened,</span> made and continuing open. The thought was familiar, for Psalmist and Prophet had uttered it to God in the prayers, “Bow Thy heavens, O Lord, and come down” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-5.htm" title="Bow your heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.">Psalm 144:5</a>); “O that Thou wouldest rend the heavens, that Thou wouldest come down” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-1.htm" title="Oh that you would rend the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might flow down at your presence,">Isaiah 64:1</a>). The Presence then before Nathanael was the answer to these longings of the soul.<p><span class= "bld">The angels of God ascending and descending.</span>—Referring again to the history of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/28-12.htm" title="And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.">Genesis 28:12-13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The Son of man.</span>—This is probably the first time that this phrase, which became the ordinary title used by our Lord of Himself, fell from His lips; but it meets us more than seventy times in the earlier Gospels, and has been explained in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.">Matthew 8:20</a>. It will be enough to observe here that it is suggested by, and is in part opposed to and in part the complement of, the titles used by Nathanael. He could clothe the Messianic idea only in Jewish titles, “Son of God,” “King of Israel.” The true expression of the idea was not Hebrew, but human, “the Son of Man,” “the Word made flesh;” <span class= "ital">the</span> Son, the true representative of the race, the Second Adam, in whom all are made alive; the Son of <span class= "ital">Man.</span> The word is <span class= "greekheb">ἄνθρωπος</span><span class= "ital">,</span> not <span class= "greekheb">ἀνήρ</span>;<span class= "ital"> homo,</span> not <span class= "ital">vir.</span> It is man as man; not Jew as holier than Greek; not free-man as nobler than bond-man; not man as distinct from woman: but humanity in all space and time and circumstance; in its weakness as in its strength; in its sorrows as in its joys; in its death as in its life. And here lies the explanation of the whole verse. The ladder from earth to heaven is in the truth “The Word was made flesh.” In that great truth heaven was, and has remained, opened. From that time onwards messengers were ever going backward and forward between humanity and its God. The cry of every erring and helpless child to its Father for guidance and strength; the silent appeal of the wronged and down-trodden to the All-Just Avenger; the fears and hopes of the soul burdened by the unbearable weight of sin, and casting itself on the mercy of the Eternal Love—all these are borne by messengers who always behold the face of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-10.htm" title="Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 18:10</a>). And every light that falls upon the path, and strength that nerves the moral frame; every comfort to the heart smarting beneath its wrong; every sense of forgiveness, atonement, peace—all these like angels descend that ladder coming from heaven to earth. Ascending precedes descending, as in the vision of old, Heaven’s messengers are ever ready to descend when earth’s will bid them come. The revelation of the fullest truth of God is never wanting to the heart that is open to receive it. The ladder is set up upon the earth, but it reaches to heaven, and the Lord stands above it. It goes down to the very depths of man’s weakness, wretchedness, and sin; and he may lay hold of it, and step by step ascend it. In the Incarnation, Divinity took human form on earth; in the Ascension, Humanity was raised to heaven.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:43-51 See the nature of true Christianity, it is following Jesus; devoting ourselves to him, and treading in his steps. Observe the objection Nathanael made. All who desire to profit by the word of God, must beware of prejudices against places, or denominations of men. They should examine for themselves, and they will sometimes find good where they looked for none. Many people are kept from the ways of religion by the unreasonable prejudices they conceive. The best way to remove false notions of religion, is to make trial of it. In Nathanael there was no guile. His profession was not hypocritical. He was not a dissembler, nor dishonest; he was a sound character, a really upright, godly man. Christ knows what men are indeed. Does He know us? Let us desire to know him. Let us seek and pray to be Israelites indeed, in whom is no guile; truly Christians, approved of Christ himself. Some things weak, imperfect, and sinful, are found in all, but hypocrisy belongs not to a believer's character. Jesus witnessed what passed when Nathanael was under the fig-tree. Probably he was then in fervent prayer, seeking direction as to the Hope and Consolation of Israel, where no human eye observed him. This showed him that our Lord knew the secrets of his heart. Through Christ we commune with, and benefit by the holy angels; and things in heaven and things on earth are reconciled and united together.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Verily, verily - In the Greek, "Amen, amen." The word "amen" means "truly, certainly, so be it" - from the Hebrew verb to confirm, to establish, to be true. It is often used in this gospel. When repeated it expresses the speaker's sense of the importance of what he is saying, and the "certainty" that it is as he affirms.<p>Ye shall see - Not, perhaps, with the bodily eyes, but you shall have "evidence" that it is so. The thing shall take place, and you shall be a witness of it.<p>Heaven open - This is a figurative expression, denoting "the conferring of favors." <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-23.htm">Psalm 78:23-24</a>; "he opened the doors of heaven, and had rained down manna." It also denotes that God was about to work a miracle in attestation of a particular thing. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>. In the language, here, there is an evident allusion to the ladder that Jacob saw in a dream, and to the angels ascending and descending on it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>. It is not probable that Jesus referred to any particular instance in which Nathanael should literally see the heavens opened. The baptism of Jesus had taken place, and no other instance occurred in his life in which it is said that the "heavens were" opened.<p>Angels of God - Those pure and holy beings that dwell in heaven, and that are employed as ministering spirits to our world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>. Good men are represented in the Scriptures as being under their protection, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>. They are the agents by which God often expressed his will to men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>. They are represented as strengthening the Lord Jesus, and ministering unto him. Thus they aided him in the wilderness <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>, and in the garden <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>, and they were present when he rose from the dead, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2-4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12-13</a>. By their ascending and descending upon him it is probable that he meant that Nathanael would have evidence that they came to his aid, and that he would have "the" kind of protection and assistance from God which would show "more fully that he was the Messiah." Thus his life, his many deliverances from dangers, his wisdom to confute his skilled and cunning adversaries, the scenes of his death, and the attendance of angels at his resurrection, may all be represented by the angels descending upon him, and all would show to Nathanael and the other disciples most clearly that he was the Son of God.<p>The Son of man - A term by which lie often describes himself. It shows his humility, his love for man, his willingness to be esteemed "as a man," <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-7</a>.<p>From this interview with Nathanael we may learn:<p>1. that Jesus searches the heart.<p>2. that he was truly the Messiah.<p>3. that he was under the protection of God.<p>4. that if we have faith in Jesus, it will be continually strengthened the evidence will grow brighter and brighter.<p>5. that if we believe his word, we shall yet see full proof that his word is true.<p>6. Since Jesus was under the protection of God, so all his friends will be. God will defend and save us also if we put our trust in Him.<p>7. Jesus applied terms expressive of humility to himself. He was not solicitous even to be called by titles which he might claim.<p>So we should not be ambitious of titles and honors. Ministers of the gospel most resemble him when they seek for the fewest titles, and do not aim at distinctions from each other or their brethren.

Hereafter, &c.&#8212;The key to this great saying is Jacob's vision (Ge 28:12-22), to which the allusion plainly is. To show the patriarch that though alone and friendless on earth his interests were busying all heaven, he was made to see "heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon a" mystic "ladder reaching from heaven to earth." "By and by," says Jesus here, "ye shall see this communication between heaven and earth thrown wide open, and the Son of man the real Ladder of this intercourse."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These things he ushers in with a <span class="ital">Verily, verily, </span> and declareth them spoken not to Nathanael alone, but <span class="ital">unto you; </span> viz. all you that are my disciples indeed, who are (like Nathanael) true Israelites, in whom there is no guile. For the terms, Amen, Amen, (by us translated, <span class="bld">Verily, verily</span>), some of the ancients accounted them an oath; but the most learned modern writers have seen no reason to agree with them. Surely (see a large discourse about these particles in our learned Fuller, his Miscellan. 1.1. cap. 2, to which nothing need be added) if Amen is never used in the Old Testament but as a term of prayer or wishing, in the New Testament it is used to assert or affirm a thing, or as a particle of wishing and prayer. The word in the Hebrew properly signifies, <span class="ital">truth, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm" title="That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.">Isaiah 65:16</a></span>; whence Christ (the truth) is called <span class="ital">the Amen, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14</a></span>. As the prophets were wont to begin their discourses with <span class="ital">The word of the Lord, </span> and <span class="ital">Thus saith the Lord, </span> to assert the truth of what they were about to say; so Christ, to show that himself was God, and spake from himself, begins with Amen; and Amen, Amen, sometimes: it is observed that John constantly doubles the particle, and saith Amen, Amen, that is, <span class="ital">Verily, verily; </span> either (as interpreters say) for further confirmation of the thing, or to get the greater attention, or to assert as well the truth of the speaker as of the thing spoken. Now the thing spoken followeth as a thing promised, not to Nathanael only, but to all believers, that they should <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">see the heavens opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span> Some think that hereby is meant the spiritual, metaphorical opening of heaven to believers by Christ. But it seems more properly to signify such an opening of the heavens as we read of, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a></span>. Some understand it of the appearances of angels to Christ at his passion, and resurrection, and ascension; but it seems rather to refer to the day of judgment, when ten thousands of angels shall wait upon Christ, as the Judge of the quick and the dead, and minister unto him; which ministration, they say, is expressed by the terms of ascending and descending, with reference (doubtless) to Jacob’s vision, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm" title="And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.">Genesis 28:12</a></span>: Jacob saw it sleeping, Nathanael and other believers shall see it with open eyes. Others interpret it more generally, viz. You shall see as many miracles as if you saw the heavens opened, and the angels ascending and descending. Others think it refers to some further appearances of the angels to Christ in their ministration to him than the Scripture records. Christ doth not say, You shall see angels ascending and descending upon me, but <span class="ital">upon the Son of man; </span> by which our learned Lightfoot saith, he did not only declare himself to be truly man, but the Second Adam, in whom what was lost in the first was to be restored. It is observed, that only Ezekiel in the Old Testament, and Christ in the New Testament, are thus called; and that Christ was never thus called but by himself. Ezekiel was doubtless so called to distinguish him from those spiritual beings with which he often conversed: Christ, to distinguish his human nature from his Divine nature, both which (in him) made up one person. Christ’s calling himself so was but a further indication of his making himself of no reputation, while he was in the form of a servant. Others think, that <span class="ital">the Son of man</span> in the gospel, used by Christ, signifies no more than I, and me; (it being usual in the Hebrew dialect for persons to speak of themselves in the third person); so, <span class="ital">upon the Son of man, </span> is, upon me, who am truly man. Chemnitius thinks, that as the term <span class="ital">Messiah</span> (by which the people commonly called Christ) was taken out of Daniel; so this term, by Christ applied to the same person, is taken out thence too, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a></span>, where it is said, <span class="ital">one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, </span>& c.; and that Christ did ordinarily so call himself, to correspond with the prophecy of Daniel, to assert himself truly man, and to declare himself his Father’s servant, according to the prophecy, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he saith unto him, verily, verily, I say unto you,.... Not only to Nathanael, but to the rest of the disciples that were then with him; and to show himself to be the "Amen", and faithful witness, as well as more strongly to asseverate what he was about to say, he doubles the expression: <p>hereafter you shall see heaven open; either in a literal sense, as it had been at his baptism; or, in a mystical sense, that there should be a clearer manifestation of heavenly truths made by his ministry; and that the way into the holiest of all should be made more manifest; and a more familiar intercourse he opened between God and his people; and also between angels and saints: <p>and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of man; or to the son of man, as the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions render it; meaning himself in human nature; the second Adam, and seed of the woman; and is expressive both of the truth, and infirmity of that nature. Reference may here be had to the ladder Jacob dreamed of, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>, which was a representation of Christ, in his person, as God-man; who, as God, was in heaven, whilst he, as man, was on earth; and in his office, as Mediator between God and man, making peace between them both; and in the ministration of angels to him in person, and to his body the church. And it is observable, that some of the Jewish writers (y) understand the ascent, and descent of the angels, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>, to be, not upon the ladder, but upon Jacob; which makes the phrase there still more agreeable to this; and so they render  in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>, not "above it", but "above him". Or the, sense is, that there would be immediately made such clearer discoveries of his person, and grace by his ministry, and such miracles would be wrought by him in confirmation of it, that it would look as if heaven was open, and the angels of God were continually going to and fro, and bringing fresh messages, and performing miraculous operations; as if the whole host of them were constantly employed in such services: and this the rather seems to be the sense, since the next account we have, is, of the beginning of Christ's miracles to manifest forth his glory in Cana of Galilee, where Nathanael lived; and since the word, rendered "hereafter", signifies, "from henceforward"; or, as the Persic version renders it, "from this hour"; though the word is left out in the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, <p>(y) Bereshit Rabba, sect. 68. fol. 61. 2. &amp; sect. 69. fol. 61. 3, 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God <span class="cverse3">{x}</span> ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span><p>(x) These words signify the power of God which would appear in Christ's ministry by the angels serving him as the head of the Church.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πιστεύεις</span> is, with Chrysostom and most others (even Lachmann and Tischendorf, not Godet), to be taken <span class="ital">interrogatively;</span> see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-29.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.">John 20:29</a>.[129] But the question is not uttered in a tone of <span class="ital">censure</span>, which would only destroy the fresh bloom of this first meeting (Theophylact: “he had not yet rightly believed in Christ’s Godhead”); nor is it even the expression of slight disapproval of a faith which was not yet based upon adequate grounds (De Wette, comp.

In John likewise it is the standing Messianic designation of Jesus as used by Himself; here, where angelic powers are represented as waiting upon Him who bears the Messianic authority, it corresponds rather with the prophetic vision of the Son of man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>), and forms the impressive conclusion of the whole section, confirming and ratifying the joyous faith and confession of the first disciples, as the first solemn self-avowal on the part of Jesus in their presence. It <span class="ital">thus</span> retained a deep and indelible hold upon the recollection of John, and therefore it stands as the utterance of the clear Messianic consciousness of Jesus unveiled before us at the outset of His work. It is exactly in John that the Messiahship of Jesus comes out with the greatest precision, not as the consequence and result, but as already, from the beginning onwards, the subject-matter of our Lord’s self-consciousness.[131]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[129] As to the <span class="ital">paratactic protasis</span>, which may be read interrogatively or not according to the character of the discourse, see C.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/4-19.htm" title="And he said to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men....">Matthew 4:19-20</a>. The harmony of the two accounts consists in this simply, that the two pairs of brothers are the earliest apostles. To recognise in John’s account not an actual history, but a picture of the author’s own, drawn by himself for the sake of illustrating his idea (Baur, Hilgenfeld, Schenkel),—that, viz., the knowledge of the disciples and that of Jesus Himself as to His Messianic call might appear perfect from the outset,—is only one of the numerous self-deceptions in criticism which form the premisses of the unhistorical conclusion that the fourth Gospel is not the work of the apostle, but of some writer of much later date, who has <span class="ital">moulded</span> the history into the form of his own ideal. On the contrary, we must here specially observe that the author, if he wished to antedate the time and place of the call, certainly did not need, for the carrying out of his idea, to invent a totally different <span class="ital">situation</span> from that which was before his eyes in the Synoptics. Over and above this, the assumption that, by previously receiving John’s baptism, Jesus renounced any independent action (Schenkel), is pure imagination. Weizsäcker (p. 404) reduces John’s account to this: “The first acquaintance between Jesus and these followers of His was brought about by His meeting with the Baptist; and on that occasion, amid the excitement which the Baptist created, Messianic hopes, however transitory, were kindled in this circle of friends.” But this rests upon a treatment of the fourth Gospel, according to which it can no longer claim the authority of an independent witness; instead of this witness, we have merely the poet of a thoughtful Idyll. And when Keim (I. p. 553) finds here only the narration of an age that could no longer endure the humble and human beginnings of Jesus, but would transplant into the time of His first appearance that glory which, as a matter of history, first distinguished His departure and His exaltation, this is all the more daring a speculation, the more closely, according to Keim, the origin of the Gospel verges upon the lifetime of the apostle, and must therefore present the most vivid recollections of His disciples.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[132] So, most recently, Märcker, <span class="ital">Uebereinstimm. der Evang. d.

The <span class="greekheb">τὸν λεγόμενον Πέτρον</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Matthew 4:18</a>, furnishes no proof, as is plain from the parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-16.htm" title="Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Mark 1:16</a>, which is the source of Matthew’s account, but as not those words. They are simply a personal notice added from the standing-point of the writer, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-2.htm" title="Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;">Matthew 10:2</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκρίθη</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὄψῃ</span>. In accordance with the habit of this evangelist, who calls attention to the moving cause of faith in this or that individual, the source of Nathanael’s faith is indicated with some surprise that it should have proved sufficient: and with the announcement that his nascent faith will find more to feed upon: <span class="greekheb">μείζω τούτων ὄψῃ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>John 1:52. What these things are is described in the words <span class="greekheb">ὄψεσθε</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπου</span>, introduced by the emphatic <span class="greekheb">ἀμὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμῖν</span>, used in this double form twenty-five times in this Gospel (always single in Synop.) and well rendered “verily, verily”. Christ as the Faithful and True Witness is Himself called the Amen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14</a>. The words <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἄρτι</span> are omitted by recent editors. The announcement describes the result of the incarnation of Christ as a bringing together of heaven and earth, a true mediation between God and man, an opening of what is most divine for the satisfaction of human need. It is made in terms of Jacob’s dream (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-10.htm" title="And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.">Genesis 28:10</a> ff.). In his dream Jacob saw a ladder fixed on earth with its top in heaven, <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἄγγελοι τοῦ θεοῦ ἀνέβαινον καὶ κατέβαινον ἐπʼ αὐτῇ</span>. What Jacob had dreamt was in Christ realised. The Son of Man, the Messiah or actual representative of God on earth, brings God to man and makes earth a Bethel, and the gate of heaven. What Nathanael under his fig tree had been longing for and unconsciously preparing, an open communication with heaven, a ladder reaching from the deepest abyss of an earth submerged in sin to the highest heaven of purity, Jesus tells him is actually accomplished in His person. “The Son of Man” is the designation by which Jesus commonly indicates that He is the Messiah, while at the same time He suggests that His kingdom is not founded by earthly power or force, but by what is especially human, sympathy, reason, self-sacrifice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">51</span>. <span class="ital">Verily, verily</span>] The double ‘verily’ occurs 25 times in this Gospel, and nowhere else, always in the mouth of Christ. It introduces a truth of special solemnity and importance. The single ‘verily’ occurs about 30 times in Matthew 14 in Mark , , 7 in Luke. The word represents the Hebrew ‘Amen,’ which in the LXX. never means ‘verily.’ In the Gospels it has no other meaning. The ‘Amen’ at the end of sentences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.

This does not refer to the angels which appeared after the Temptation, at the Agony, and at the Ascension: rather to the perpetual intercourse between God and the Messiah during His ministry.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Son of man</span>] This phrase in all four Gospels is invariably used by Christ Himself of Himself as the Messiah, upwards of 80 times in all. None of the Evangelists direct our attention to this strict limitation in the use of the expression: their agreement on this striking point is evidently undesigned, and therefore a strong mark of their veracity. See notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.">Matthew 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-10.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he said to the sick of the palsy,)">Mark 2:10</a>.

He knows that he saith true; his word is truth. <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you,</span> [<span class="cmt_word">From</span> <span class="cmt_word">henceforth</span>] <span class="cmt_word">ye shall see the heaven that has been opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</span> Notwithstanding the formidable superficial difficulty in the common reading, which declares that from the moment when the Lord spake, Nathanael should see what there is no other record that he ever literally saw; yet a deeper pondering of the passage shows the sublime spiritual sense in which those disciples who fully realized that they had been brought into blessed relationship with the "Son of man," saw also - that heaven, the abode of blessedness and righteousness, the throne of God, had been opened behind him and around him. The dream of Jacob is  manifestly referred to - the union between heaven and earth, between God and man, which dawned like a vision of a better time upon the old patriarchal life. That which was the dream of a troubled night may now be the constant experience of the disciples of the Lord. The ascension of the angelic ministers is here said to precede their descent. This is due to the original form of the dream of Jacob, but must be supplemented by the Lord's own statement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>), "No one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven." The free access to the heart of the Father, and to the centre of all authority in heaven and earth, is due only to those who have come already thence, who belong to him, "who go and return as the appearance of a flash of lightning." They ascend with the desires of the Son of man; they descend with all the faculty needed for the fulfilment of those desires. He, "the Son of man," is now on earth to commence his ministry of reconciliation, and is thus now equipped with all the powers needed for its realization. The same truth is taught by our Lord, when he said (cf. notes on John 3:13) that "the Son of man is in heaven," even when he walked the earth. The angelic ministry attendant upon our Lord is so inconspicuous that it does not fulfil the notable description of this verse, nor fill out its suggestions. The miraculous energies, the Divine revelations, the consummate heavenliness of his life, the power which his personality supplied to see and believe in heaven - in heaven opened, heaven near, heaven accessible, heaven propitious, heaven lavish of love - answers to the meaning of the mighty words. Thoma ('Die Genesis des Johannes-Evan.') sees the Johannine interpretation of the angels who ministered to Jesus after the conclusion of his temptation. But why does he call himself "the Son of man," in sharp response to, or in comment, on, the ascription by John the Baptist and Nathanael of the greater title "Son of God" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-28.htm">Mark 2:28</a>)? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The phrase is one that our Lord currently used for himself, as especially descriptive of his position. It has been said that its origin must be looked for in the prophecies of Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>), where angelic powers are seen in loving lowly attendance on "one like to the Son of man," one whose human-hearted force contrasts with the "beast forces," the uncouth, sphynx-like blending of animal faculties which characterizes all the kingdoms and dynasties which the empire of the one like the Son of man would supersede. The term, "Son of man," is used repeatedly by Ezekiel for humanity set over against the Divine voice and power. There it corresponds with the Aramaic "Bar-Enosh," Son of man - a simple paraphrasis for "man" in his weakness, and often in his depression and sin. The 'Book of Henoch,' in numerous places, identifies "Son of man" with the Messiah (ch. 46. and 48.), but it cannot be clearly proved that the term was <span class="accented">popularly</span> current for the Messiah. Christ seems, in one place, to discriminate the two terms in popular expectation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13, 16</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a> he discriminates his earthly ministry as that of Son of man, from the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, though the dispensation of his human life, and of his eternal Spirit, constitute that of the one Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Another very remarkable fact is that, though Jesus calls himself "the Son of man" no fewer than seventy times, the apostles never attribute the favourite expression to him. The only instances of its use by other than the Lord himself, is by the dying Stephen, who thus describes his power and exalted majesty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>), and John in the Apocalypse, who says the vision of the Lord was of one like unto the Son of man - a phrase clearly built upon the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Saviour did not throughout the Gospel of John proclaim himself openly to the people as the Christ, avoiding a term which was so miserably degraded from his own conception of it; but he used a multitude of expressions to denote the spiritual force and significance of the Messianic dignity. Thus he described himself" as he that came down from heaven;" as the "Bread of heaven;" as the "Light of the world;" as "the good Shepherd; .... I am <span class="accented">he</span>;" "that which I said from the beginning," etc.; and therefore, when he adopted the phrase, "the Son of man," he attributed to it very special powers and dignities. The word seems to involve the Man, the perfect Man, the ideal Man, the second Adam, the supreme Flower engrafted on the barren stock of humanity, the Representative of the whole of humankind. Chronologically, this must have been the primary revelation. Through humanity that was archetypal and perfect, answering God's idea of man, the thought of the race has risen to a conception of Divine sonship. But metaphysically, logically, he could only fulfil the functions of Son of man, of <span class="accented">the Man</span>, because he was essentially the Son of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The dominant thought of the term has fluctuated between that which connotes his earthly ministry and humiliation, and lays stress on the privations and sufferings of the Son of man, and that which recites his highest claim to reverence and homage. Seeing that he claims to be the link between heaven and earth, Judge of quick and dead, the Head of the kingdom of God, who will come in his glory, with his holy angels, to divide sheep from goats, etc., as <span class="accented">Son of man</span>; and  seeing that, as Son of man, he gave himself for a ransom, and was as one that serveth, and presented his flesh and blood as the spiritual food of all that live; - the synthetic thought that issues from the twofold survey is that his highest glory is based upon his entire and utter sympathy with man. His humanity is that which gives him all his hold upon our heart; his sacrifice is his title to universal sovereignty. "He humbled himself to the death of the cross, wherefore God also has highly exalted him, giving even to him [humanity included] THE NAME that is above every name." Archdeacon Watkins, <span class="accented">in loco</span>, has called attention to the fact that it is not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "man as man, not Jew as holier than Greek, not freeman as nobler than bondman, not man as distinct from woman, but humanity.... The ladder from earth to heaven is in the truth, 'The Word was made flesh.' In that great truth heaven was and has remained open." The cries of earth, the answers of heaven, are like angels evermore ascending and descending on the Word-made-flesh. It is perfectly true, though in a different sense than that which Thorns adopts it, that this prehistory (<span class="accented">vorgeschichte</span>) is the <span class="accented">vorgeschichte</span> of Christendom, as of each soul becoming Christian, the different eventualities which lead from one revelation to another betoken the several stations on the blessed pilgrimage (<span class="accented">heilsweg</span>). (Cf. Introduction; the excursuses of Godet; Westcott on 'The Son of Man;' Orme's dissertation on 'Sin against the Holy Ghost;' Schaff's note to Lange, on John, <span class="accented">in loco</span>; Schmidt, 'Bibl. Theol. N.T.,' <span class="accented">pp.</span> 107, etc.; Weiss, 'Bibl. Theol.

The words literally mean, from henceforth; and therefore, as Canon Westcott aptly remarks, "if genuine, would describe the communion between earth and heaven as established from the time when the Lord entered upon His public ministry."<p>Heaven (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., giving the article, the heaven.<p>Open (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#837;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>The perfect participle. Hence Rev., rightly, opened. The participle signifies standing open, and is used in the story of Stephen's martyrdom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a>. The image presented to the true Israelite is drawn from the history of his ancestor Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>).<p>Angels<p>With the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-29.htm">John 12:29</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>, John does not use the word "angel" elsewhere in the Gospel or in the Epistles, and does not refer to their being or ministry. Trench ("Studies in the Gospels") cites a beautiful passage of Plato as suggestive of our Lord's words. Plato is speaking of Love. "He is a great spirit, and like all spirits he is intermediate between the divine and the mortal. He interprets between gods and men, conveying to the gods the prayers and sacrifices of men, and to men the commands and replies of the gods; he is the mediator who spans the chasm which divides them, and in him all is bound together, and through him the acts of the prophet and the priest, their sacrifices and mysteries and charms, and all prophecy and incantation find their way. For God mingles not with man, but through Love all the intercourse and speech of God with man, whether awake or asleep, is carried on" ("Symposium," 203).<p>Son of man<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-22.htm">Luke 6:22</a>. Notice the titles successively applied to our Lord in this chapter: the greater Successor of the Baptist, the Lamb of God, the Son of God, the Messiah, the King of Israel. These were all given by others. The title Son of man He applies to Himself.<p>In John's Gospel, as in the Synoptists, this phrase is used only by Christ in speaking of Himself; and elsewhere only in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>, where the name is applied to Him by Stephen. It occurs less frequently in John than in the Synoptists, being found in Matthew thirty times, in Mark thirteen, and in John twelve.<p>Jesus' use of the term here is explained in two ways.<p>continued...</body></html>
