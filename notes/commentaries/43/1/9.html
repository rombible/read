It would, probably, give a better sense to translate it, <span class= "ital">The true Light which lighteth every man was coming into the world, i.e.,</span> was manifesting itself at the time when John was bearing witness and men were mistaking the lamp for the light.

The meaning of the Greek is quite clear. The difficulty arises from the fact that in English there is but one word to represent the two ideas. The word for the fuller meaning of “ideally true” is not confined to St. John, but is naturally of very frequent recurrence in his writings. The adjective is used nine times in this Gospel, and not at all in the other three. A comparison of the passages will show how important it is to get a right conception of what the word means, and will help to give it. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-23.htm" title="But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.">John 4:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-37.htm" title="And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps.">John 4:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.">John 6:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.">John 7:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-16.htm" title="And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.">John 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm" title="I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.">John 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm" title="And this is life eternal, that they might know you the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.">John 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-35.htm" title="And he that saw it bore record, and his record is true: and he knows that he said true, that you might believe.">John 19:35</a>.) But, as ideally true, the Light was not subject to the changing conditions of time and space, but was and is true for all humanity, and “lighteth every man.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/john/1.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>John<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE WORD IN ETERNITY, IN THE WORLD, AND IN THE FLESH<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The other Gospels begin with Bethlehem; John begins with ‘the bosom of the Father.’ Luke dates his narrative by Roman emperors and Jewish high-priests; John dates his ‘in the beginning.’ To attempt adequate exposition of these verses in our narrow limits is absurd; we can only note the salient points of this, the profoundest page in the New Testament.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The threefold utterance in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a> carries us into the depths of eternity, before time or creatures were. Genesis and John both start from ‘the beginning,’ but, while Genesis works downwards from that point and tells what followed, John works upwards and tells what preceded-if we may use that term in speaking of what lies beyond time. Time and creatures came into being, and, when they began, the Word ‘was.’ Surely no form of speech could more emphatically declare absolute, uncreated being, outside the limits of time. Clearly, too, no interpretation of these words fathoms their depth, or makes worthy sense, which does not recognise that the Word is a person. The second clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a> asserts the eternal communion of the Word with God. The preposition employed means accurately ‘towards,’ and expresses the thought that in the Word there was motion or tendency towards, and not merely association with, God. It points to reciprocal, conscious communion, and the active going out of love in the direction of God. The last clause asserts the community of essence, which is not inconsistent with distinction of persons, and makes the communion of active Love possible; for none could, in the depths of eternity, dwell with and perfectly love and be loved by God, except one who Himself was God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a> stands apart as revealing the pretemporal and essential nature of the Word. In it the deep ocean of the divine nature is partially disclosed, though no created eye can either plunge to discern its depths or travel beyond our horizon to its boundless, shoreless extent. The remainder of the passage deals with the majestic march of the self-revealing Word through creation, and illumination of humanity, up to the climax in the Incarnation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> John repeats the substance of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-2.htm" title="The same was in the beginning with God.">John 1:2</a>, apparently in order to identify the Agent of creation with the august person whom he has disclosed as filling eternity. By Him creation was effected, and, because He was what <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a> has declared Him to be, therefore was it effected by Him. Observe the three steps marked in three consecutive verses. ‘All things were made by Him’; literally ‘became,’ where the emergence into existence of created things is strongly contrasted with the divine ‘was’ of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>. ‘Through Him’ declares that the Word is the agent of creation; ‘without Him’ {literally, ‘apart from Him’} declares that created things continue in existence because He communicates it to them. Man is the highest of these ‘all things,’ and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men.">John 1:4</a> sets forth the relation of the Word to Him, declaring that ‘life,’ in all the width and height of its possible meanings, inheres in Him, and is communicated by Him, with its distinguishing accompaniment, in human nature, of light, whether of reason or of conscience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So far, John has been speaking as from the upper or divine side, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a> he speaks from the under or human, and shows us how the self-revelation of the Word has, by some mysterious necessity, been conflict. The ‘darkness’ was not made by Him, but it is there, and the beams of the light have to contend with it. Something alien must have come in, some catastrophe have happened, that the light should have to stream into a region of darkness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> John takes ‘the Fall’ for granted, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a> describes the whole condition of things, both within and beyond the region of special revelation. The shining of the light is continuous, but the darkness is obstinate. It is the tragedy and crime of the world that the darkness will not have the light. It is the long-suffering mercy of God that the light repelled is not extinguished, but shines meekly on.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm" title="There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.">John 1:6</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-13.htm" title="Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.">John 1:13</a> deal with the historical appearance of the Word. The Forerunner is introduced, as in the other Gospels; and, significantly enough, this Evangelist calls him only ‘John,’-omitting ‘the Baptist,’ as was very natural to him, the other John, who would feel less need for distinguishing the two than others did. The subordinate office of a witness to the light is declared positively and negatively, and the dignity of such a function is implied. To witness to the light, and to be the means of leading men to believe, was honour for any man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The limited office of the Forerunner serves as contrast to the transcendent lustre of the true Light. The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a> may be doubtful, but <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm" title="He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.">John 1:10</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm" title="He came to his own, and his own received him not.">John 1:11</a> clearly refer to the historical manifestation of the Word, and probably <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a> does so too. Possibly, however, it rather points to the inner revelation by the Word, which is the ‘light of men.’ In that case the phrase ‘that cometh into the world’ would refer to ‘every man,’ whereas it is more natural in this context to refer it to ‘the light,’ and to see in the verse a reference to the illumination of humanity consequent on the appearance of Jesus Christ. The use of ‘world’ and ‘came’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm" title="He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.">John 1:10</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm" title="He came to his own, and his own received him not.">John 1:11</a> points in that direction. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a> represents the Word as ‘coming’; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm" title="He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.">John 1:10</a> regards Him as come-’He was in the world.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note the three clauses, so like, and yet so unlike the august three in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>. Note the sad issue of the coming-’The world knew Him not.’ In that ‘world’ there was one place where He might have looked for recognition, one set of people who might have been expected to hail Him; but not only the wide world was blind {‘knew not’} , but the narrower circle of ‘His own’ fought against what they knew to be light {‘received not’} .<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the rejection was not universal, and John proceeds to develop the blessed consequences of receiving the light. For the first time he speaks the great word ‘believe.’ The act of faith is the condition or means of ‘receiving.’ It is the opening of the mental eye for the light to pour in. We possess Jesus in the measure of our faith. The object of faith is ‘His name,’ which means, not this or that collocation of letters by which He is designated, but His whole self-revelation. The result of such faith is ‘the right to become children of God,’ for through faith in the only-begotten Son we receive the communication of a divine life which makes us, too, sons. That new life, with its consequence of sonship, does not belong to human nature as received from parents, but is a gift of God mediated through faith in the Light who is the Word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a> is not mere repetition of the preceding, but advances beyond it in that it declares the wonder of the way by which that divine Word did enter into the world. John here, as it were, draws back the curtain, and shows us the transcendent miracle of divine love, for which he has been preparing in all the preceding. Note that he has not named ‘the Word’ since <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>, but here he again uses the majestic expression to bring out strongly the contrast between the ante-temporal glory and the historical lowliness. These four words, ‘The Word became flesh,’ are the foundation of all our knowledge of God, of man, of the relations between them, the foundation of all our hopes, the guarantee of all our peace, the pledge of all blessedness. ‘He tabernacled among us.’ As the divine glory of old dwelt between the cherubim, so Jesus is among men the true Temple, wherein we see a truer glory than that radiant light which filled the closed chamber of the holy of holies. Rapturous remembrances rose before the Apostle as he wrote, ‘We beheld His glory’; and he has told us what he has beheld and seen with his eyes, that we also may have fellowship with him in beholding. The glory that shone from the Incarnate Word was no menacing or dazzling light. He and it were ‘full of grace and truth,’ perfect Love bending to inferiors and sinners, with hands full of gifts and a heart full of tenderness and the revelation of reality, both as regards God and man. His grace bestows all that our lowness needs, His truth teaches all that our ignorance requires. All our gifts and all our knowledge come from the Incarnate Word, in whom believing we are the children of God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:6-14 John the Baptist came to bear witness concerning Jesus. Nothing more fully shows the darkness of men's minds, than that when the Light had appeared, there needed a witness to call attention to it. Christ was the true Light; that great Light which deserves to be called so. By his Spirit and grace he enlightens all that are enlightened to salvation; and those that are not enlightened by him, perish in darkness. Christ was in the world when he took our nature upon him, and dwelt among us. The Son of the Highest was here in this lower world. He was in the world, but not of it. He came to save a lost world, because it was a world of his own making. Yet the world knew him not. When he comes as a Judge, the world shall know him. Many say that they are Christ's own, yet do not receive him, because they will not part with their sins, nor have him to reign over them. All the children of God are born again. This new birth is through the word of God as the means, 1Pe 1:23, and by the Spirit of God as the Author. By his Divine presence Christ always was in the world. But now that the fulness of time was come, he was, after another manner, God manifested in the flesh. But observe the beams of his Divine glory, which darted through this veil of flesh. Men discover their weaknesses to those most familiar with them, but it was not so with Christ; those most intimate with him saw most of his glory. Although he was in the form of a servant, as to outward circumstances, yet, in respect of graces, his form was like the Son of God His Divine glory appeared in the holiness of his doctrine, and in his miracles. He was full of grace, fully acceptable to his Father, therefore qualified to plead for us; and full of truth, fully aware of the things he was to reveal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That was the true Light - Not John, but the Messiah. He was not a false, uncertain, dangerous guide, but was one that was true, real, steady, and worthy of confidence. A false light is one that leads to danger or error, as a false beacon on the shores of the ocean may lead ships to quicksands or rocks; or an "ignis fatuus" to fens, and precipices, and death. A true light is one that does not deceive us, as the true beacon may guide us into port or warn us of danger. Christ does not lead astray. All false teachers do.<p>That lighteth - That enlightens. He removes darkness, error, ignorance, from the mind.<p>Every man - This is an expression denoting, in general, the whole human race - Jews and Gentiles. John preached to the Jews. Jesus came "to be a light to lighten the Gentiles," as well as to be the "glory of the people of Israel," <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-32.htm">Luke 2:32</a>.<p>That cometh into the world - The phrase in the original is ambiguous. The word translated "that cometh" may either refer to the "light," or to the word "man;" so that it may mean either "this 'true light that cometh' into the world enlightens all," or "it enlightens every 'man that cometh' into the world." Many critics, and, among the fathers, Cyril and Augustine, have preferred the former, and translated it, "The true light was he who, coming into the world, enlightened every man." The principal reasons for this are:<p>1. That the Messiah is often spoken of as he that cometh into the world. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>.<p>2. He is often distinguished as "the light that cometh into the world." <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; "this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world." <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-46.htm">John 12:46</a>; "I am come a light into the world."<p>Christ may be said to do what is accomplished by his command or appointment. This passage means, therefore, that by his own personal ministry, and by his Spirit and apostles, light or teaching is afforded to all. It does not mean that every individual of the human family is enlightened with the knowledge "of the gospel," for this never yet has been; but it means:<p>1. That this light is not confined to the "Jews," but is extended to all - Jews and Gentiles.<p>2. That it is provided for all and offered to all.<p>3. It is not affirmed that at the time that John wrote all "were actually enlightened," but the word "lighteth" has the form of the "future." "This is that light so long expected and predicted, which as the result of its coming into the world, will ultimately enlighten all nations." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. lighteth every man, &c.&#8212;rather, "which, coming into the world, enlighteneth every man"; or, is "the Light of the world" (Joh 9:5). "Coming into the world" is a superfluous and quite unusual description of "every man"; but it is of all descriptions of Christ amongst the most familiar, especially in the writings of this Evangelist (Joh 12:46; 16:28; 18:37; 1Jo 4:9; 1Ti 1:15, &c.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That was the true Light:</span> <span class="ital">true</span> is sometimes opposed to what is false, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-25.htm" title="Why putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.">Ephesians 4:25</a></span>; sometimes to what is typical and figurative, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm" title="For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.">John 1:17</a></span>; sometimes to what is not original, and of itself: in opposition to all these Christ is the <span class="ital">true Light; </span> he who alone deserved the name of light, having light in himself, and from himself, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-8.htm" title="Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.">1Jo 2:8</a></span>, and shining more gloriously than the prophets or apostles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which lighteth every man that cometh into the world; </span> he lighteth not the Jews only, (as the prophets of old), but both the Jews and Gentiles. Some understand this of the light of reason; but besides that reason is no where in holy writ called light, neither did this illumination agree to Christ as Mediator. It is rather therefore to be understood of the light of gospel revelation, which Christ caused to be made to all the world, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.">Mark 16:15</a></span>. Those who interpret it of the more internal illumination by the Holy Spirit of God, by which Christ is not revealed <span class="ital">to us</span> only, but <span class="ital">in us, </span> say, that Christ hath done what lay in him (as a Minister of the gospel) so to enlighten all that came into the world; and that Christ is said to enlighten every man, because none is enlightened but by him, and that some of all sorts are by him enlightened; in one of which two latter senses the terms <span class="ital">all</span> and <span class="ital">every man</span> must be interpreted in a multitude of texts in the Gospel. The words in the Greek are so, as they may either be translated as we read them, or thus, who coming into the world, enlightened every man: a more universal spiritual light, or means to come to the knowledge of God, overspreading the world after Christ’s coming, than before.

Christ is that light, that famous and excellent light, the fountain of all light to all creatures; that gave light to the dark earth at first, and spoke light out of darkness; that light of all men in the earth, and of all the angels in heaven, and of all the saints below, and of all the glorified ones above: he is the true light, in distinction from typical lights; the "Urim" of the former dispensation; the candlestick, with the lamps of it; the pillar of fire which directed the Israelites by night in the wilderness; and from all the typical light there was in the institutions and sacrifices of the law; and in opposition to the law itself, which the Jews (z) magnify, and cry up as the light, saying, there is no light but the law; and in opposition to all false lights, as priests, diviners, and soothsayers among the Gentiles, Scribes, and Pharisees, and the learned Rabbins among the Jews, so much boasted of as the lights of the world; and to all false Christs and prophets that have risen, or shall rise, in the world, <p>Which lighteth every man that cometh into the world: the sense is, either that every man that is enlightened in a spiritual manner, is enlightened by him, which is true of Christ, as the Son of God, existing from the beginning; but not in the Socinian sense, as if they were enlightened by his human ministry and example; for the Old Testament saints were not enlightened by his preaching; and many were enlightened by the ministry of John the Baptist; and multitudes afterwards, through the ministry of the apostles; and very few, comparatively, were enlightened under the ministry of Christ; and none we read of, in this sense, enlightened by him, when, and as soon as they came into, the world: or, the meaning is, that he is that light which lighteth all sorts of men; which is true in, a spiritual sense: some connect the phrase, "that cometh into the world", not with "every man", but with the "true light"; and the Arabic version so reads, and joins it to the following verse; but this reading is not so natural and the order of the words requires the common reading; nor is the difficulty removed hereby; for still it is every man that is enlightened: it is best therefore to understand these words of the light of nature, and reason, which Christ, as the word, and Creator and light of men, gives to every man that is born into the world; and which serves to detect the Quakers' notion of the light within, which every man has, and is no other than the light of a natural conscience; and shows how much men, even natural men, are obliged to Christ, and how great a person he is, and how deserving of praise, honour, and glory. The phrase, "every man that cometh into the world", is Jewish, and often to be met with in Rabbinical writings, and signifies all men that are born into the world; the instances are almost innumerable; take one or two: on those words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-3.htm">Job 25:3</a> on whom doth not his light arise? it is asked (a), who is he that cometh, <p> , "of all that come into the world"; and says, the sun hath not lightened me by day, nor hath the moon lightened me by night! thou enlightenest those above, and those below, and "all that come into the world". <p>Again, God is introduced thus speaking (b): <p>"I am the God,  , "of all that come into the world"; and I have not united my name, but to the people of Israel. <p>Once more (c), <p>"Moses, our master, from the mouth of power, (i.e. God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>.) commanded to oblige,   , "all that come into the world", to receive the commandments which were commanded the sons of Noah. <p>(z) T.

For the correct apprehension of this verse, we must observe, (1) that <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> has the main emphasis, and therefore is placed at the beginning: (2) that <span class="greekheb">τὸ φῶς τὸ ἀληθ</span>. cannot be the predicate, but must be the subject, because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-8.htm" title="He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.">John 1:8</a> another was the subject; consequently without a <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>, or some such word, there are no grounds for supposing a subject not expressed: (3) that <span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν κόσμον</span> (with Origen, Syr., Copt., Euseb., Chrys., Cyril., Epiph., Nonnus, Theophyl., Euth. Zig., It., Vulg., Augustine, Erasmus, Luther, Beza, Calvin, Aret., and most of the early expositors[81]) can only be connected with <span class="greekheb">πάντα ἄνθρωπον</span>, not with <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>; because when John was bearing witness the Logos <span class="ital">was</span> already in the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-26.htm" title="John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you know not;">John 1:26</a>), not simply then <span class="ital">came</span> into the world, or was <span class="ital">about</span> to come, or <span class="ital">had</span> to come. We should thus be obliged arbitrarily to restrict <span class="greekheb">ἐρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κόσμ</span>. to His <span class="ital">entrance upon His public ministry</span>, as Grotius already did (from whom Calovius differs), and because the order of the words does not suggest the connecting of <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμ</span>.; rather would the prominence given to <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>, and its wide separation from <span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμ</span>., be without any reason. Hence the connection by the early church of <span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">π</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρ</span>. is by no means to be regarded, with Hilgenfeld, as obsolete, but is to be retained,—to be explained, however, thus: <span class="ital">“The true Light was existing, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world”</span>. This, together with the following <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ ἦν</span> onwards to <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span>, serves, by preparing the way, to strengthen the portentous and melancholy antithesis, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ κόσμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸν οὐκ ἔγνω</span>. The usual objection that <span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>., when referred to <span class="greekheb">πάντα ἄνθρ</span>., is a superfluous by-clause, is inept. There is such a thing as a <span class="ital">solemn</span> redundance, and that we have here, an <span class="ital">epic fulness of words</span>. Hence we must reject (1) the usual interpretation by the older writers (before Grotius), with whom even Kaeuffer sides: “<span class="ital">He</span> (or even <span class="ital">that</span>, namely to <span class="greekheb">τὸ φῶς</span>) <span class="ital">was the true Light which lighteth all men who come into this world</span>” (Luther), against which we have already remarked under (1) and (2) above; again, (2) the construction which connects <span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">φῶς</span> as an accompanying definition (so probably Theod. Mopsu.; some in Augustine, <span class="ital">de pecc. mer. et rem</span>. i. 25; Castalio, Vatablus, Grotius; Schott, <span class="ital">Opusc</span>. I. p. 14; Maier): “He was the true Light, <span class="ital">which was at that time to come into the world;</span>”[82] also, (3) the connecting of <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμενον</span>, so as to interpret it either in a purely historical sense (Bleek, Köstlin, B. Crusius, Lange, Hengstenberg: <span class="ital">“He came”</span>, with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a>; and so already Bengel); or relatively, as De Wette, Lücke: “when John had appeared to bear witness of Him, <span class="ital">even then</span> came the true Light into the world,” comp. Hauff in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1846, p. 575; or as future, of Him who was soon to appear: <span class="ital">venturum erat</span> (Rinck, Tholuck), according to Luthardt (comp. Baeuml.): “it had been <span class="ital">determined</span> of God that He should come;” or more exactly, of an unfulfilled state of things, still present at that present time: <span class="ital">“It was coming”</span> (Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr</span>. p. 51[83]); and according to Ewald, who attaches it to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-4.htm" title="In him was life; and the life was the light of men....">John 1:4-5</a> : “It <span class="ital">was at that time always coming into the world</span>, so that every human being, if he had so wished, might have let himself be guided by Him;” comp. Keim: “He was <span class="ital">continually coming</span> into the world.” As to details, we have further to remark: <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>] <span class="ital">aderat</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-39.htm" title="(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)">John 7:39</a> and often; its more minute definition follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm" title="He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.">John 1:10</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ ἦν</span>.

Luther’s explanation down to 1527 was better: “through His advent into this world.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[83] That is, during the time before His baptism; the man Jesus (according to the Valentinian Gnosis) did not become the organ of the Logos until His baptism, and accordingly through that rite the Logos first came into the world. The birth of Jesus was only introductory to that coming. Brückner, while rejecting this importation of Gnosticism, agrees in other respects with Hilgenfeld.—Philippi (<span class="ital">der Eingang d. Joh. Ev</span>. p. 89): “He was to come, <span class="ital">according to the promises of the O.

The light was not …: the light was … In this verse the light is also further contrasted with John. The Baptist was himself a light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-35.htm" title="Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;">John 1:35</a>) but not to <span class="greekheb">τὸ φῶς τὸ ἀληθινόν</span>. This designation occurs nine times in John, never in the Synoptists. It means that which corresponds to the ideal; true not as opposed to false, but to symbolical or imperfect. The light is further characterised as <span class="greekheb">ὃ φωτίζει πάντα ἄνθρωπον</span>. This is the text on which the Quakers found for their doctrine that every man has a day of visitation and that to every man God gives sufficient grace. Barclay in his <span class="ital">Apology</span> says: “This place doth so clearly favour us that by some it is called ‘the Quakers’ text,’ for it doth evidently demonstrate our assertion”. It was also much used by the Greek Fathers, who believed that the Logos guided the heathen in their philosophical researches (see Justin’s <span class="ital">Dial.</span>, ii., etc., and Clement, <span class="ital">passim</span>).—<span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμενον</span> has been variously construed, with <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπον</span>, with <span class="greekheb">τὸ φῶς</span>, or with <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>. (1) The first construction is favoured by Chrysostom, Euthymius, the Vulgate, and A. V[25], “<span class="ital">that</span> was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world”; or with Meyer, “the true light which lightens every man coming into the world was present” (<span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> = aderat). To the objection that <span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">κόσμον</span> is thus redundant, Meyer replies that there is such a thing as a <span class="ital">solemn</span> redundance, and that we have here an “epic fulness of words”. But the “epic fulness” is here out of place, emphasising <span class="greekheb">πάντα ἄνθρωπον</span>. Besides, in this Gospel, “coming into the world” is not used of human <span class="ital">birth</span>, but of appearance in one’s place among men. And still further <span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμενον</span> of this verse is obviously in contrast with the <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ ἦν</span> of the next, and the subject of both clauses must be the same. (2) The second construction, with <span class="greekheb">τὸ φῶς</span>, was advocated by Grotius (“valde mihi se probat expositio quae apud Cyrillum et Augustinum exstat, ut hoc <span class="greekheb">ἐρχόμενον</span> referatur ad <span class="greekheb">τὸ φῶς</span>,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm" title="And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.">John 3:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-46.htm" title="I am come a light into the world, that whoever believes on me should not abide in darkness.">John 12:46</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.">John 18:37</a>), and has been adopted by Godet, who renders thus: “(That light) was the true light which lighteth every man, <span class="ital">by coming</span> (itself) into the world”. If this were John’s meaning, it is difficult to see why he did not insert <span class="greekheb">οὗτος</span> as in the second verse or <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>. (3) The third construction, with <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>, has much to recommend it, and has been adopted by Westcott, Holtzmann, and others. The R. V[26] margin renders as if <span class="greekheb">ἧν ἐρχόμενον</span> were the periphrastic imperfect commonly used in N. T., “the true light which enlighteneth every man was coming into the world,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, at the time when the Baptist was witnessing, the true light was dawning on the world. Westcott, however, thinks it best to take it “more literally and yet more generally as describing a coming which was progressive, slowly accomplished, combined with a permanent being, so that both the verb (<span class="ital">was</span>) and the participle (<span class="ital">coming</span>) have their full force and do not form a periphrasis for an imperfect”. And he translates: “There was the light, the true light which lighteth every man; that light was, and yet more, that light was coming into the world”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[25] Authorised Version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[26] Revised Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">That was</span>, &c.] This verse is ambiguous in the Greek. Most of the Ancient Versions, Fathers, and Reformers agree with our translators. Many modern commentators translate—<span class="bld">the true Light, which lighteth every man, was coming into the world</span>: but ‘was’ and ‘coming’ are almost too far apart in the Greek for this. There is yet a third way;—<span class="bld">there was the true Light, which lighteth every man by coming into the world</span>. ‘Was’ is emphatic: ‘there <span class="ital">was</span> the true Light,’ even while the Baptist was preparing the way for Him. The Baptist came once for all; the Light was ever coming.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word for ‘true’ (<span class="ital">alêthinos</span>) is remarkable: it means true as opposed to ‘spurious,’ not true as opposed to ‘lying.’ It is in fact the old English ‘very,’ e.g. ‘very God of very God’. Christ then is the true, the genuine, the perfect Light, just as He is ‘the perfect Bread’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-32.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.">John 6:32</a>) and ‘the perfect Vine’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm" title="I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.">John 15:1</a>): not that He is the only Light, and Bread, and Vine, but that He is in reality what all others are in figure and imperfectly. All words about <span class="ital">truth</span> are very characteristic of S. John.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">every man</span>] not ‘all men:’ the Light illumines each one singly, not all collectively. God deals with men separately as individuals, not in masses. But though every man is illumined, not every man is the better for it: that depends upon himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that cometh into the world</span>] A Jewish phrase for being born, frequent in S. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-39.htm" title="And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.">John 9:39</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-27.htm" title="She said to him, Yes, Lord: I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.">John 11:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-28.htm" title="I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.">John 16:28</a>); see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.">John 18:37</a>. ‘The world’ is another of the expressions characteristic of S. John: it occurs nearly 80 times in the Gospel and 22 in the First Epistle. This verse, Hippolytus tells us (<span class="ital">Refut.</span> vii. x.), was used by Basilides in defending his doctrine, and as he began to teach about a.d. 125, this is very early evidence of the use of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἦν</span>, <span class="ital">was</span>) <span class="ital">The Light</span> itself, moreover, was <span class="ital">that true</span> light, <span class="ital">which enlighteneth</span>.

Either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> with Meyer, we may give to <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span> the complete sense of existence, presence, and include in it the full predicate of the sentence; thus: "Existing, present (when John commenced his ministry), was the veritable Light which enlighteneth every man coming into the world." But the clause, "coming into the world," would here not only be superfluous, but moreover, while used elsewhere and often of Christ's incarnation, is never used of ordinary birth in the Scriptures, though it is a rabbinical expression. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Lange, Moulton, Westcott, Godet, applying the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> to the <span class="accented">light</span> rather than to <span class="accented">man</span>, translate it, "That was the true Light which lighteth every man, by coming into the world, or that cometh into the world." The difficulty of this is that it makes the coming into the world, in some new sense, the occasion of the illumination of every man, although the evangelist has already spoken (ver. 4) of the Life which is the Light of men. A third method is to make the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> the true predicate of the sentence, and translate thus: <span class="cmt_word">The veritable Light which illumines every man was coming</span> (ever coming) <span class="cmt_word">into the world;</span> and there is a sense and manner of his coming which transcends all others, about which he is to speak at length. This might receive another meaning if <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> were equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>; then a positive reference would here he made to the historic fact of the Incarnation. But it seems to me the evangelist is drawing a contrast between the continuous coming into the world of the veritable Light and the specific Incarnation of ver. 14. Consequently, the author here travels over and connotes a wider theme, namely, the operation of that archetypal Light, that veritable Light which differs from all mere reflections of it, or imitations of it, or luminous testimonies to it. The difference between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is important. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-33.htm">John 3:33</a> and John 5:31, and very often to denote the true in opposition to the false, the veracious as distinct from the deceptive. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is used in the Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23, 37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-32.htm">John 6:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-28.htm">John 7:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>), First Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-20.htm">1 John 5:20</a>), and Apocalypse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a>), and hardly anywhere else (see Introduction), for the real as opposed to the phenomenal, the archetypal as opposed to the various embodiments of it, the veritable as distinct from that which does not answer to its own ideal. Now, about this veritable light, in addition to all that has been said already, two things are declared. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It illumines every man, giveth light to every individual man, in all time. Though the darkness apprehendeth it not, yet man is illumined by it. Various interpretations have been given of the method or conditions of this illumination. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The light of the reason and conscience - the higher reason, which is the real eye for heavenly light, and the sphere for the operation of grace. This would make the highest intellectual faculty of man a direct effulgence of the archetypal Light, and confirm the poet Wordsworth's definition of conscience as "God's most intimate  presence in the world." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The inner light of the mystical writers, and the "common grace" of the Remonstrant theology. Or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> the Divine instruction bestowed on every man from the universal manifestation of the Logos life. No man is left without some direct communication of light from the Father of lights. That light may be quenched, the eye of the soul may be blinded, the folly of the world may obscure it as a cloud disperses the direct rays of the sun; but a fundamental fact remains - the veritable Light illumines every man. Then <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is further declared that this Light was ever coming into the world. Bengel and Hengstenberg, as Lange and Baumgarten-Crusius, regard it as in the purely historic sense, declaratory of the great fact of the Incarnation. But Ewald, Keim, Westcott, and others decide that it refers to his <span class="accented">continual coming</span> into the world. Up to the time of the Incarnation, the great theme of the prophets is (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) the Coming One. Nor can we conceal the numberless assurances of the old covenant that the Lord of men was always "coming," and did come, to them. At one time he came in judgment, and at another time in mercy; now by worldwide convulsions, then by the fall of empires; again by the sense of need, of guilt and peril, by the bow of promise which often broke in beauty on the retreating storm cloud, by the mighty working of conscience, by the sense given to men of their Divine relationships and their dearness to God, - by all these experiences <span class="accented">he has ever been coming</span>, and <span class="accented">he cometh still.</span> Ever since the coming in the flesh and the subsequent cessation of that manifestation, he has ever been coming in the grace of the Holy Spirit, in all the mission of the Comforter, in the fall of the theocratic system and city, in the great persecutions and deliverances, the chastisements and reformations, the judgments and revivals of his Church. The eternal, veritable Light which does, by its universal shining, illumine <span class="accented">every</span> man, is still coming. The cry, "He is coming," was the language of the noblest of heathen philosophies; "He is coming," is the burden of the Old Testament; "He is coming again," is the great undersong of the Church to the end of time: "Even so, come, Lord Jesus." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>That was the true light, etc.<p>This passage is differently interpreted. Some join coming (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) with man (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), and render every man that cometh, as A.V. Others join coming with light, and render, as Rev., the true light - coming into the world. The latter is the preferable rendering, and is justified by John's frequent use of the phrase coming into the world, with reference to our Lord. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-27.htm">John 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-46.htm">John 12:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-28.htm">John 16:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-46.htm">John 12:46</a>, it is used as here, in connection with light. Note especially the latter, where Jesus himself says, "I am come a light into the world." Was (&#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;) is to be taken independently, there was, and not united in a single conception with coming (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), so as to mean was coming. The light was, existed, when the Baptist appeared as a witness. Up to the time of his appearance it was all along coming: its permanent being conjoined with a slow, progressive coming, a revelation "at sundry times and in diverse manners" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>). "From the first He was on His way to the world, advancing toward the incarnation by preparatory revelations" (Westcott). Render therefore as Rev., "There was the true light, even the light which lighteth every man, coming into the world."<p>True (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Wyc., very light (compare the Nicene creed, "very God of very God"). This epithet is applied to light only here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/2-8.htm">1 John 2:8</a>, and is almost confined to the writings of John. A different word, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, also rendered true, occurs at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-33.htm">John 3:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-31.htm">John 5:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-13.htm">John 8:13</a>, and elsewhere. The difference is that &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b6; signifies true, as contrasted with false; while &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; signifies what is real, perfect, and substantial, as contrasted with what is fanciful, shadowy, counterfeit, or merely symbolic. Thus God is &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-33.htm">John 3:33</a>) in that He cannot lie. He is &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>), as distinguished from idols. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-2.htm">Hebrews 8:2</a>, the heavenly tabernacle is called &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;, as distinguished from the Mosaic tabernacle, which was a figure of the heavenly reality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). Thus the expression true light denotes the realization of the original divine idea of the Light - the archetypal Light, as contrasted with all imperfect manifestations: "the Light which fulfilled all that had been promised by the preparatory, partial, even fictitious lights which had existed in the world before."<p>"Our little systems have their day;<p>They have their day and cease to be:<p>They are but broken lights of Thee,<p>And Thou, O Lord, art more than they."<p>Tennyson, In Memoriam.<p>Lighteth (&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>See on shineth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm">John 1:5</a>, and compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/11-35.htm">Luke 11:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-36.htm">Luke 11:36</a>.<p>Every man (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Not collectively, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>, but individually and personally.<p>The world (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>continued...</body></html>
