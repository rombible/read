The statement is made to explain the question which follows, but it should be observed that in this Gospel, where the Sadducees are nowhere mentioned, the term “Pharisees” seems to be used almost in the sense of “Sanhedrin.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm" title="When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,">John 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-3.htm" title="And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the middle,">John 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-46.htm" title="But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.">John 11:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-57.htm" title="Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show it, that they might take him.">John 11:57</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-24.htm" title="And they which were sent were of the Pharisees....">John 1:24-28</a></span>. <span class="ital">They which were sent were of the Pharisees </span>— Who were peculiarly tenacious of old customs, and jealous of any innovations, (except those brought in by their own scribes,) unless the innovator had unquestionable proofs of divine authority. Add to this, the decisions of the Pharisees were held by the common people as infallible. And, as their sect had declared that only proselytes were to be baptized, on this account also they found fault with John for baptizing; <span class="ital">saying, Why baptizest thou then</span> — Without any commission from the sanhedrim; and not only heathen, (who were always baptized before they were admitted to circumcision,) but Jews also? <span class="ital">if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, </span>&c. — The Jews, it seems, had conceived an opinion that they were all to be baptized when the Messiah came, either by himself, or by some of his retinue, because it was said, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm" title="In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.">Zechariah 13:1</a>,) <span class="ital">In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David, &c., for sin and for uncleanness. </span>They thought that John’s altering, in this manner, their institutions, was an exercise of authority which, by his own confession, did not belong to him. <span class="ital">John answered, I baptize you with water </span>— To prepare you for the Messiah; I call you to repentance and amendment of life, and admit the penitent to my baptism, to represent to you that reformation of conduct and purity of heart which are requisite, in order to the reception of him. Hereby also John showed, that Jews as well as Gentiles must be proselytes to Christ; and that the former, as well as the latter, stood in need of being washed from their sins. I baptize you: but observe, it is with water only, which cannot cleanse you from your sins, as the washing predicted by Zechariah will do. <span class="ital">But there standeth one among you, </span>&c. — That more efficacious baptism will be dispensed unto you by the Messiah, who is at present among you, though you do not know him, because he has not manifested himself. <span class="ital">He coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoes, </span>&c. — Besides, in dignity the Messiah is infinitely my superior, for I am not worthy to be his servant, or to do him the meanest offices. <span class="ital">These things were done in Bethabara, where John was baptizing </span>— Consequently, in the presence of a great multitude of people. The word, <span class="ital">Bethabara, </span>signifies, <span class="ital">the house of passage. </span>It lay near that part of the river which was miraculously dried up, that the Israelites, under the command of Joshua, might pass over into Canaan.

He came in the spirit and power of Elias, but he was not the person of Elias. John was not that Prophet whom Moses said the Lord would raise up to them of their brethren, like unto him. He was not such a prophet as they expected, who would rescue them from the Romans. He gave such an account of himself, as might excite and awaken them to hearken to him. He baptized the people with water as a profession of repentance, and as an outward sign of the spiritual blessings to be conferred on them by the Messiah, who was in the midst of them, though they knew him not, and to whom he was unworthy to render the meanest service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Were of the Pharisees - For an account of this sect, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>. Why they are particularly mentioned is not certainly known. Many of the "Sadducees" came to his baptism <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>, but it seems that they did not join in sending to him to know what was the design of John. This circumstance is one of those incidental and delicate allusions which would occur to no impostor in forging a book, and which show that the writers of the New Testament were honest men and knew what they affirmed. Because:<p>1. The Pharisees composed a great part of the Sanhedrin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>. It is probable that a deputation from the Sanhedrin would be of that party.<p>2. The Pharisees were very tenacious of rites and customs, of traditions and ceremonies. They observed many. They believed that they were lawful, <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3-4</a>. Of course, they believed that those rites might be increased, but they did not suppose that it could be done except by the authority of a prophet or of the Messiah. When, therefore, John came "baptizing" - adding a rite to be observed by his followers - baptizing not only Gentiles, but also Jews - the question was whether he had authority to institute a new rite; whether it was to be received among the ceremonies of religion. In this question the Sadducees felt no interest, for they rejected all such rites at once; but the Pharisees thought it was worth inquiry, and it was a question on which they felt themselves specially called on to act as the guardians of the ceremonies of religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

The inquiry, which proceeds still further, finds a pragmatic issue in <span class="ital">pharisaic</span> style (for the Sanhedrim had chosen their deputies from this learned, orthodox, and crafty party). From their strict scholastic standing-point, they could allow (<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>) so thoroughly reformatory an innovation as that of baptism (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-5.htm" title="Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,">Matthew 3:5</a>), considering its connection with Messiah’s kingdom, only to the definite personalities of the Messiah, Elias, or the promised prophet, and not to a man with so vague a call as that which the Baptist from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm" title="The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.">Isaiah 40:3</a> ascribed to himself,—a passage which the Pharisees had not thought of explaining in a Messianic sense, and were not accustomed so to apply it in their schools. Hence the parenthetical remark just here inserted: “<span class="ital">And they that were sent belonged to the Pharisees</span>,”—a statement, therefore, which points <span class="ital">forwards,</span> and does not serve as a <span class="ital">supplementary</span> explanation of the hostile spirit of the question (Euthymius Zigabenus, Lücke, and most others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">reply</span> corresponds to what the Baptist had said of himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-23.htm" title="He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.">John 1:23</a>, that he was appointed to <span class="ital">prepare</span> the way for the Messiah. <span class="ital">His</span> baptism, consequently, was not the baptism of the Spirit, which was reserved for the <span class="ital">Messiah</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>), but a <span class="ital">baptism</span> of water, yet without the <span class="ital">elementum coeleste;</span> there was already standing, however, in their midst the far greater One, to whom this preparatory baptism pointed. The <span class="ital">first</span> clause of the verse, <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ βαπτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὕδατι</span>, implies, therefore, that by <span class="ital">his</span> baptism he does not lay claim to anything that belongs to the <span class="ital">Messiah</span> (the baptism of the <span class="ital">Spirit</span>); and this portion refers to the <span class="greekheb">εἰ σὺ οὐκ εἶ ὁ Χριστός</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a>. The <span class="ital">second</span> clause, however, <span class="greekheb">μέσος</span>, etc., implies that this preliminary baptism of his had now the justification, owing to his relation to the Messiah, of a divinely ordained necessity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-23.htm" title="He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.">John 1:23</a>); since the Messiah, unknown indeed to them, already stood in their midst, and consequently what they allowed to Elias, or the prophet, dare not be left unperformed on his part; and this part of his answer refers to the <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ Ἠλίας οὐδὲ ὁ προφήτης</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a>. Thus the question <span class="greekheb">τί οὖν βαπτίζεις</span> is answered by a <span class="ital">twofold</span> reason. There is much that is inappropriate in the remarks of expositors, who have not sufficiently attended to the connection: <span class="ital">e.g</span>., De Wette overlooks the appropriateness of the answer to the Elias question; Tholuck contents himself with an appeal to the “laconic-<span class="ital">comma</span> style” of the Baptist; and Brückner thinks that “John wished to give no definite answer, but yet to indicate his relation to the Messiah, and the fact of his pointing to Him;” while Bäumlein holds that the antithetical clause, <span class="greekheb">ὃς βαπτίσει ἐν πνεύμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγ</span>., which was already intended to be here inserted, was <span class="ital">forgotten</span>, owing to the intervening sentences; and finally, Hilgenfeld, after comparing together Matthew and Luke, deduces the unhistorical character of the narrative. Heracleon already was even of opinion that John did not answer according to the question asked of him, but as he <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς ἐβούλετο</span>. In answer to him, Origen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span>] has the emphasis of an <span class="ital">antithesis</span> to the higher Baptizer (<span class="greekheb">μέσος δὲ</span>, etc.), not to <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span> (Godet). Next to this, the stress lies on <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὕδατι</span>. This is the <span class="ital">element</span> (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>) in which his baptism was performed. This otherwise superfluous addition has a <span class="ital">limiting</span> force, and hence is <span class="ital">important</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μέσος</span> without the spurious <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span> is all the more emphatic; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm" title="For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.">John 1:17</a>. The emphasizing of the <span class="ital">antithesis</span>, however, has brought this <span class="greekheb">μέσος</span>] to the front, because it was <span class="ital">the manifestation of the Messiah</span>, already taking place <span class="ital">in the very midst of the Jews</span>, which justified John in baptizing. Had the Messiah been still far off, that baptism would have lacked its divine necessity; He was, however, standing in their midst, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀναμεμιγμένος τότε τῷ λαῷ</span> (Euthymius Zigabenus).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὃν ὑμεῖς οὐκ οἴδατε</span>] reveals the reason why they could question as they had done in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a>. The emphasis is on <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>, as always (against Tholuck); here in contrast with the knowledge which he himself had (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.">John 1:28</a>, note) of the manifested Messiah: <span class="ital">you on your part, you people</span>, have the Messiah among you, and know Him not (that is, as the Messiah). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-27.htm" title="He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's lace I am not worthy to unloose.">John 1:27</a>, after rejecting the words <span class="greekheb">αὐτός ἐστιν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὃς ἔμπροσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μου γέγονεν</span> (see the critical notes), there remains only <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὀπίσω μου ἐρχόμενος</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>), and that in fact as the subject of <span class="greekheb">μέσος ἕστηκεν</span>, which subject then receives the designation of its superiority over the Baptist in the <span class="greekheb">οὗ ἐγὼ οὐκ εἰμὶ ἄξιος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Concerning this designation, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm" title="I indeed baptize you with water to repentance. but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.">Matthew 3:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span>] <span class="ital">I for my part</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄξιος ἵνα</span>] <span class="ital">worthy that I should loose;</span> <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> introduces the <span class="ital">purpose</span> of the <span class="greekheb">ἀξιότης</span>.

T. p. 184]. <span class="greekheb">Τούτου</span> would have been still more emphatic.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-24.htm" title="And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.">John 1:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀπεσταλμένοι ἦσαν ἐκ τῶν Φαρισαίων</span>. This gives us the meaning “And they had been sent from,” which is not so congruous with the context as “And they who were sent were of the Pharisees”; because apparently this clause was inserted to explain the following question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a>): <span class="greekheb">τί οὖν βαπτίζεις</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὁ προφήτης</span>; Founding on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm" title="In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.">Zechariah 13:1</a>, “In that day there shall be a fountain opened for sin and for uncleanness,” and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm" title="Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.">Ezekiel 36:25</a>, “then will I sprinkle clean water upon you,” they expected a general purification before the coming of the Messiah. Hence their question. If John was not the Messiah, nor the prophet, nor Elias in close connection with the Messiah, why did he baptise? Lightfoot (<span class="ital">Hor. Heb.</span>, p. 965) quotes from Kiddushin “Elias venit ad immundos distinguendum et ad purificandum”. See also Ammonius and Beza quoted in Lampe. In reply to this objection of the Pharisees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-26.htm" title="John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there stands one among you, whom you know not;">John 1:26</a>) John says: <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ βαπτίζω</span> … <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ὑποδήματος</span>, “I for my part baptise with water”; the emphatic “I” leading us to expect mention of another with whom a contrast is drawn. This contrast is further signified by the mention of the element of the baptism, <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὕδατι</span>; a merely symbolic element, but also the element by baptism in which preparation for the Messiah was to be made. And John’s administration of this precursory baptism is justified by the fact he immediately states, <span class="greekheb">μέσος ὑμῶν στήκει ὃν ὑμεῖς οὐκ οἴδατε</span>. Had <span class="ital">they</span> been aware of this presence (<span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span> emphatic) as John was aware of it, they could not have challenged the baptism of John, because it was the divinely appointed preparation for the Messiah’s advent. This scarcely amounts to what Lampe calls it, “nova exprobratio ignorantiae Pharisaeorum” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-19.htm" title="Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?">Isaiah 42:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-14.htm" title="Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.">Isaiah 29:14</a>), because as yet they had had no opportunity of knowing the Christ.—<span class="greekheb">μέσος ὑμῶν</span>. There is no reason why the words should not be taken strictly. So Euthymius, <span class="greekheb">ἦν γὰρ ὁ Χριστὸς ἀναμεμιγμένος τότε τῷ λαῷ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ὀπίσω μου ἐρχόμενος</span>, denoting the <span class="ital">immediate</span> arrival of the Messiah and John’s close connection with Him. He is further described relatively to John as inconceivably exalted above him, <span class="greekheb">οὗ οὐκ εἰμὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὑποδήματος</span>. The grammatical form admitting both the relative and pers. pronoun is Hebraistic. <span class="greekheb">ἄξιος ἵνα</span> also stands instead of the classical construction with the infinitive. Talmudists quote the saying: “Every service which a servant will perform for his master, a disciple will do for his Rabbi, except loosing his sandal thong”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">And they which</span>, &c.] Perhaps the better reading is, <span class="ital">and</span> <span class="bld">there had been sent some of the Pharisees</span>.

The evangelist is wont to set down certain, as it were, parentheses, as to causes, as to place, as to occasions, as to ends, as to effects, as to hindrances, of things, actions and speeches, and similar decisions, by means of which the subjects, which are in hand, may the more clearly be understood, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.">John 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-45.htm" title="Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.">John 1:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-24.htm" title="For John was not yet cast into prison.">John 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-8.htm" title="(For his disciples were gone away to the city to buy meat.)">John 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-5.htm" title="For neither did his brothers believe in him.">John 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-39.htm" title="(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)">John 7:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-20.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.">John 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-27.htm" title="They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.">John 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-14.htm" title="And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.">John 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-22.htm" title="These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.">John 9:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-22.htm" title="And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter....">John 10:22-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-13.htm" title="However, Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.">John 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-30.htm" title="Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.">John 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-33.htm" title="This he said, signifying what death he should die.">John 12:33</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">they</span>  <span class="cmt_word">had been sent from the Pharisees,</span> which amounts to the same thing as "they which were sent were of the Pharisees," and it is after the manner of John to introduce explanatory, retrospective comment, which may throw light on what follows (vers. 41, 45; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-30.htm">John 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-5.htm">John 11:5</a>). The  <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> of the following verse shows that we have still to do with the same deputation. The Pharisees were accustomed to lustral rites, but had legal points to make as to the authority of any man who dared to impose them upon the sacred nation, and especially on their own section, which made its special boast of ceremonial exactitude and purity. They might justify an old prophet, or the Elijah of Malachi, and still more the Christ himself, should he call men to baptismal cleansing. But the dim mysterious "voice in the wilderness," even if John could prove his words, had no such prescriptive claim. The Pharisaic priests and Levites would take strong views on the baptismal question, and even exalt it into a more eminent place in their thoughts than the fundamental question, "Art thou the very Christ?" The same confusion of essential and accidental elements of religious truth and life was not confined to old Pharisees. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>They which were sent were (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Literally, those having been sent were. But the best texts omit the article, so that the remaining words form the pluperfect passive: "they had been sent from the Pharisees." This addition of an explanatory circumstance is characteristic of John.
