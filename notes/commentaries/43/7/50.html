As if he had said, Do not we ourselves act as if we <span class="ital">knew not the law, </span>if we pass sentence on a man before we hear him? <span class="ital">They answered </span>— By personal reflection; the argument they could not answer, and therefore did not attempt it. For, notwithstanding that perfect knowledge of the law, and that high reverence for its precepts, which they made such boast of, they were acting directly contrary to the most essential principles of equity established by it. But, being greatly exasperated by Nicodemus’s reproof, which was the more poignant and provoking, because it was well founded; and being in a violent passion with him, for condemning their conduct, and speaking favourably of Jesus, they asked him, with an air of disdain and surprise mixed with fierceness, <span class="ital">Art thou also of Galilee </span>— Art thou one of his party? One of the ignorant, low faction, that has leagued to support a Galilean Messiah in opposition to the law, which has determined the Messiah’s nativity to Bethlehem? <span class="ital">Search and look; for out of Galilee ariseth </span>(or rather, <span class="ital">hath arisen, </span>as <span class="greekheb">ουκ εγηγερται </span>properly signifies) <span class="ital">no prophet </span>— They could not but know the contrary. They knew Jonah arose out of Gath-hepher; and Nahum from another village in Galilee. Yea, and Thisbe, the town of Elijah the Tishbite, was in Galilee also. They might, likewise, have known that Jesus was not born in Galilee, but at Bethlehem, even from the public register there, and from the genealogies of the family of David. Add to this, that many of the people had heard the shepherds declare, on the testimony of the angel, that he was born at Bethlehem, and had <span class="ital">wondered at the words which had been told them by the shepherds, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/2-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us....">Luke 2:15-18</a>. Nay, and the chief priests and Pharisees were not ignorant that the wise men from the East went to Bethlehem to worship him soon after he was born, as <span class="ital">king of the Jews: </span>the memory of which facts could not be lost in the space of thirty years. Here, then, we have a striking instance of the power of prejudice to shut men’s eyes against the clearest truth. Dr. Campbell, however, thinks they did not mean all that they expressed; because, when men’s passions are inflamed, they are not wont to be accurate in their words, or distinct in recollecting, on the sudden, things which make against them; and that therefore this expression of the Pharisees, whom prejudice, pride, and envy had concurred in blinding, need not appear surprising to us. <span class="ital">And every man went unto his own house </span>— The council separated immediately: for, being conscious that their poor answer would not bear examination, they took care, by rising up and dispersing, to prevent a reply. So that short, plain question of Nicodemus, spoiled all their measures, and for the present frustrated their designs. <span class="ital">A word spoken in season, how good is it! </span>especially when God gives it his blessing. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:40-53 The malice of Christ's enemies is always against reason, and sometimes the staying of it cannot be accounted for. Never any man spake with that wisdom, and power, and grace, that convincing clearness, and that sweetness, wherewith Christ spake. Alas, that many, who are for a time restrained, and who speak highly of the word of Jesus, speedily lose their convictions, and go on in their sins! People are foolishly swayed by outward motives in matters of eternal moment, are willing even to be damned for fashion's sake. As the wisdom of God often chooses things which men despise, so the folly of men commonly despises those whom God has chosen. The Lord brings forward his weak and timid disciples, and sometimes uses them to defeat the designs of his enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nicodemus - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1</a>.<p>One of them - That is, one of the great council or Sanhedrin. God often places one or more pious men in legislative assemblies to vindicate his honor and his law; and he often gives a man grace on such occasions boldly to defend his cause; to put men upon their proof, and to confound the proud and the domineering. We see in this case, also, that a man, at one time timid and fearful (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1</a>), may on other occasions be bold, and fearlessly defend the truth as it is in Jesus. This example should lead every man entrusted with authority or office fearlessly to defend the truth of God, and, when the rich and the mighty are pouring contempt on Jesus and his cause, to stand forth as its fearless defender. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>50-53.

To this strong expression one of their own number (and therefore to their great surprise), Nicodemus, the same person who had visited Jesus under cover of night, takes exception and makes a protest. [Tisch[61] deletes the clause <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐλθὼν νυκτὸς πρὸς αὐτόν</span>, and no doubt it has quite the appearance of a gloss. At the same time it is John’s manner thus to identify persons named. And at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm" title="And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.">John 19:39</a> the similar clause is not deleted.] This was a bold step. For he must have known it was useless; and he might have persuaded himself to evade all risk by silence. His remonstrance is based on their implied claim to know the law: <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὁ νόμος</span> … <span class="greekheb">ποιεῖ</span>; their own action is suspiciously like a violation of the law. “Does our law pass judgment on the suspected person before it first hears him and knows what he is guilty of doing?” For the law regarding trials see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-16.htm" title="And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brothers, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.">Deuteronomy 1:16</a> and Stapfer’s <span class="ital">Palestine</span>, p. 108, on the administration of justice.

He did not go far, but he directed attention to a fundamental principle of that very "Law" which the Pharisaic party were ignoring. <span class="cmt_word">Nicodemus saith to them (he who came</span> to him <span class="cmt_word">formerly,</span> although <span class="cmt_word">being one</span> of them). The   parenthesis shows the author's strong recollection of the scene (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1</a>, etc.), when the Lord had opened to his own mind, as well as to Nicodemus, the mystery of the kingdom, and the need of that very Spirit's power to which (John knew when he wrote that) the Lord was referring in his great discourse. Nicodemus had not proclaimed his own discipleship, but he meant to cover and shield the enthusiastic crowd from the sting of the cruel condemnation of this Pharisaic junta. <span class="cmt_word">Doth our Law judge</span> <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">man</span> <span class="cmt_word">except it have first heard from himself, and have come to know what he doeth?</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a> margin, "Thou shalt not receive a false report;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16</a>, "Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother"). The Law is here personified in the person of the judge. The process is not followed by this hasty <span class="accented">ex parte</span> statement. The Law is traversed by this forgetfulness of the first principle of justice as between man and man. They might have rejoined that they <span class="accented">did</span> know the teaching and the work of Jesus. They had been following him by their representatives, and were now witnesses of his extraordinary assumptions, and had evidence enough on which to proceed. The retort which they made is sufficient proof of the defective and passion-blinded method of their own procedure. Moreover, it shows that the prophetic rank assigned to the Lord Jesus was the main question in the mind of Nicodemus and his Pharisaic companions. The rules for the judgment of a prophet were stringent, and no attempt had been made to put these prophetic claims to the test (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-19.htm">Deuteronomy 18:19-22</a>). Moreover, they ran off upon an utterly false tack, and were not free from inaccuracy in their solemn appeal to Holy Scripture. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He that came to Him by night (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>The texts vary, either substituting &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, before, for &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;, by night, or omitting the whole clause, and reading, Nicodemus saith unto them, being one of them. </body></html>
