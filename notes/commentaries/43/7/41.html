Never any man spake with that wisdom, and power, and grace, that convincing clearness, and that sweetness, wherewith Christ spake. Alas, that many, who are for a time restrained, and who speak highly of the word of Jesus, speedily lose their convictions, and go on in their sins! People are foolishly swayed by outward motives in matters of eternal moment, are willing even to be damned for fashion's sake. As the wisdom of God often chooses things which men despise, so the folly of men commonly despises those whom God has chosen. The Lord brings forward his weak and timid disciples, and sometimes uses them to defeat the designs of his enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm">Matthew 2:4-6</a>.<p>Where David was - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41.

Some of them were very well inclined to believe that he was the promised Messiah; but they stumbled at the country where alone they took notice of him. For though he came not out of Galilee, but was born in Bethlehem, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-4.htm" title="And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)">Luke 2:4</a></span>, according to the prophecy of him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a></span>, suitable to which was their tradition, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-5.htm" title="And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,">Matthew 2:5</a></span>; yet they had seen nothing of this, though possibly they had heard some relation of it, it being two and thirty years since his birth: but he was ordinarily called Jesus of Nazareth, and of Galilee, there he had lived and been educated; so as they knew no better, probably, than that he came out of Galilee, which was contrary to the prophecy, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Others said, this is the Christ,.... The true Messiah, which they concluded, not only from the miracles, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/7-31.htm">John 7:31</a>, but from his speaking of rivers of living water flowing from him that believes in him; for the same prophecy that speaks of miracles to be performed in the times of the Messiah, speaks also of waters breaking out in the wilderness, and streams in the desert, of the parched ground becoming a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>. <p>But some said, shall Christ come out of Galilee? as they supposed Jesus did; and because he was educated at Nazareth, and Capernaum was his city, and he chiefly conversed, preached, and wrought his miracles in these parts, they concluded that he was born there; and therefore object this to his being the true Messiah. For if they did not mean this, according to their own accounts, the Messiah was to be in Galilee, and to be first revealed there; for they affirm (i) this in so many words, that    , "the King Messiah shall be revealed in the land of Galilee"; accordingly Jesus, the true Messiah, as he was brought up in Galilee, though not born there, so he first preached there, and there wrought his first miracle; here he chiefly was, unless at the public feasts; and here he manifested himself to his disciples after his resurrection. <p>(i) Zohar in Gen. fol. 74. 3. &amp; in Exod. fol. 3. 3. &amp; 4. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Others said, This is the Christ.

But others, either honestly perplexed, or hostile to Christ, and glad to find Scripture on their side, objected, <span class="greekheb">μὴ γὰρ ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας ὁ Χριστὸς ἔρχεται</span>; “But does the Christ come out of Galilee?” [Hoogeveen explains the <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> by resolving the sentence into a double statement: “Others said this is not the Christ: <span class="ital">for</span> Christ will not come out of Galilee”. The <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> assigns the reason for the denial already hinted in the <span class="greekheb">ἄλλοι δὲ</span> introducing a contrary opinion to that already expressed.] They knew that Jesus was a Galilean, and this clashed with their idea that the Christ was to be born of the seed of David and in Bethlehem; an idea founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a>. Bethlehem is here called the <span class="greekheb">κώμη ὅπου ἦν Δαβίδ</span> [or <span class="greekheb">Δαυείδ</span>, which gives the same pronunciation], because there David spent his youth; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill your horn with oil, and go, I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.">1 Samuel 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-4.htm" title="And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Bethlehem.

John does not correct this mistake of supposing that Jesus came from Galilee, that he is either ignorant of the truth or indifferent to it. He knew that his readers would be well aware of the facts. On the other hand, could a Greek of the second century invent these discussions of the Jewish multitude?<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Others said, This is the Christ.</span> These must have pressed the argument further.
