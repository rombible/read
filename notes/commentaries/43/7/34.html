You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.">John 13:33</a>, where they are quoted and applied to the disciples. This will exclude any special reference, such as to the destruction of Jerusalem and to the seeking Him in the miseries which should follow, which most expositors have found here. The words refer rather to the more general truth now present to His mind, and applicable to all alike, that the time was at hand when He would return to the Father, and His bodily presence would be unapproachable, alike by those who should seek in hatred, or those who should seek in love.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:31-36 The discourses of Jesus convinced many that he was the Messiah; but they had not courage to own it. It is comfort to those who are in the world, but not of it, and therefore are hated by it and weary of it, that they shall not be in it always, that they shall not be in it long. Our days being evil, it is well they are few. The days of life and of grace do not last long; and sinners, when in misery, will be glad of the help they now despise. Men dispute about such sayings, but the event will explain them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye shall seek me - This probably means simply, Ye shall seek the Messiah. Such will be your troubles, such the calamities that will come on the nation, that you will earnestly desire the coming of the Messiah. You will seek for a Deliverer, and will look for feign that he may bring deliverance. This does not mean that they would seek for Jesus and not be able to find him, but that they would desire the aid and comfort of the Messiah, and would be disappointed. Jesus speaks of himself as the Messiah, and his own name as synonymous with the Messiah. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-39.htm">Matthew 23:39</a>.<p>Shall not find me - Shall not find the Messiah. He will not come, according to your expectations, to aid you. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>.<p>Where I am - This whole clause is to be understood as future, though the words AM and cannot are both in the present tense. The meaning is, Where I shall be you will not be able to come. That is, he, the Messiah, would be in heaven; and though they would earnestly desire his presence and aid to save the city and nation from the Romans, yet they would not be able to obtain it - represented here by their not being able to come to him. This does not refer to their individual salvation, but to the deliverance of their nation. It is not true of individual sinners that they seek Christ in a proper manner and are not able to find him; but it was true of the Jewish nation that they looked for the Messiah, and sought his coming to deliver them, but he did not do it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33, 34. Yet a little while, &c.&#8212;that is, "Your desire to be rid of Me will be for you all too soon fulfilled. Yet a little while and we part company&#8212;for ever; for I go whither ye cannot come: nor, even when ye at length seek Him whom ye now despise, shall ye be able to find Him"&#8212;referring not to any penitential, but to purely selfish cries in their time of desperation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some think the meaning is, <span class="bld">Ye shall seek me</span> to execute your malice upon me, but to no purpose, for you <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall not find me.</span> Or, You shall seek me to destroy me in my church, and to root out my name; but to no purpose. But the most probable sense is this: You wicked Jews, that now contemn the means of grace by me offered to you, shall one day be in distress and calamity enough; and when you are so, then you will wish I were again amongst you; but I shall be ascended to my Father, and as deaf to your prayers as above the reach of your malice. There is much the same thing said in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-39.htm" title="For I say to you, You shall not see me from now on, till you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.">Matthew 23:39</a></span>.

That is, the Messiah, who he was; meaning, that after his departure they should be in great distress, and be very much on the inquiry after, and solicitous for the coming of the Messiah, to be a Redeemer and Deliverer of them out of their troubles: <p>and shall not find me; no Messiah will appear, no Saviour will be sent, no Redeemer will come to relieve them; they shall inquire, and look for one in vain, as they did. <p>And where I am, thither ye cannot come; intimating hereby, that not only their temporal estate and condition would be very distressed and miserable, but also their eternal estate; since they should not be able to come where he would be in his human nature, and where he now was as a divine person, namely, in heaven. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-34.htm" title="You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.">John 7:34</a>.

These words are a kind of text, on which the discourses of this and the following chapter are built as a superstructure; ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus again to them, I go my way, and you shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I go, you cannot come.">John 8:21</a>, “I go My way, and ye shall seek Me, and shall die in your sins; whither I go, ye cannot come,” etc. Such a text occurs also, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-16.htm" title="A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me, because I go to the Father.">John 16:16</a>, “A little while, and ye shall not see Me, and again a little while and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.”—<span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐχ εὑρήσετε</span>, <span class="ital">and ye shall not find Me</span>) Afterwards He speaks more sternly, “<span class="ital">ye shall die in your sin</span>,” ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus again to them, I go my way, and you shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I go, you cannot come.">John 8:21</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὅπου</span>, <span class="ital">whither</span>) namely, to heaven: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>, “No man hath ascended up to heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of Man, which is in heaven.” The Lord sometimes put forth a discourse of such a nature, as that a meaning of it, in some degree, was, for the time being, apparent to His hearers: the deeper meaning became so subsequently. Comp. with this passage ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-33.htm" title="Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.">John 13:33</a>, “Yet a little while, I am with you. Ye shall seek Me; and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot come, so now I say to you.” Such a discourse also occurs, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-16.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.">John 13:16</a>, “The servant is not greater than his lord.” Comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-20.htm" title="Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord.

This is not justified by the connection. The limitation of the day of grace for seeking souls is not the theme of this address, and it is, save under special circumstances, no teaching of the New Testament. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The ideas of Hengstenberg and others, so largely built on the great texts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-12.htm">Amos 8:12</a>, show that the Messiah would be sought by them when they had utterly rejected Jesus. We do not believe that a genuine search for the Lord will ever be disappointed, but a vicious and vain search may be possible when the opportunity for due approach has gone by forever. Moments, catastrophes, did arrive in their tragic history when they had passionately desired, but in vain, to see one of the days of the Son of man. The individuals who turned to him found the veil which concealed him taken away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-16.htm">2 Corinthians 3:16</a>). The nation as a whole was blinded; they crucified their King, the Lord of glory; and they brought uttermost extinction on themselves as a nation. "They sought their Messiah in vain" (Weiss). <span class="cmt_word">Where I am</span> - in the glory in which I dwell, and to which I belong, and to which I am now inviting you - <span class="cmt_word">you cannot come.</span> "The door will be shut;" you will not "have known the day of your visitation." "How often would I have gathered you, but ye would not!" The seeking cannot be the search of penitence, but of unavailing despair. You have the opportunity now. In a little while I go, and then you will find it impossible to follow me. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye shall seek me<p>Not as now, for disputation or violence, but for help.<p>Where Iam<p>In absolute, eternal being and fellowship with the Father.

The phrase carries a hint of the essential nature of Jesus, and thus prepares the way for ye cannot come (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-7.htm">John 7:7</a>). The difference in character will make it essentially impossible. </body></html>
