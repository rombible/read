This is nearer to the older meaning of the word, which is used, for example, of the hoofs of animals, and the leaves of trees. St. John uses it only to mark this rent into two parties of the Jewish multitude, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.">John 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-19.htm" title="There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.">John 10:19</a>. In St. Paul it is used of the divisions of the Church at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.">1Corinthians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.">1Corinthians 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-25.htm" title="That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.">1Corinthians 12:25</a>). The use of the word in its ethical sense may belong in some special way to Ephesus, for only in writings from this city do we find it in Biblical Greek. Later, both the word and the fact denoted by it passed into the history of the Church.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:40-53 The malice of Christ's enemies is always against reason, and sometimes the staying of it cannot be accounted for. Never any man spake with that wisdom, and power, and grace, that convincing clearness, and that sweetness, wherewith Christ spake. Alas, that many, who are for a time restrained, and who speak highly of the word of Jesus, speedily lose their convictions, and go on in their sins! People are foolishly swayed by outward motives in matters of eternal moment, are willing even to be damned for fashion's sake. As the wisdom of God often chooses things which men despise, so the folly of men commonly despises those whom God has chosen. The Lord brings forward his weak and timid disciples, and sometimes uses them to defeat the designs of his enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm">Matthew 2:4-6</a>.<p>Where David was - <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42. scripture said &#8230; of the seed of David, and out of &#8230; Bethlehem, &c.&#8212;We accept this spontaneous testimony to our David-descended, Bethlehem-born Saviour. Had those who gave it made the inquiry which the case demanded, they would have found that Jesus "came out of Galilee" (Joh 7:41) and "out of Bethlehem" both, alike in fulfilment of prophecy as in point of fact.
