Some would attach the first clause to the preceding verse, reading, “If any man thirst, let him come unto Me; and let him that believeth on Me drink.” Others would have us think that the words, “as the Scripture hath said,” belong to the clause before them, and not to that which follows, making the sense, “He that believeth on Me according to the Scriptures, out of his belly (I say) shall flow rivers of living water.” The reader of the English will, it is believed, feel, and the reader of the Greek will feel still more strongly, that these are attempts to avoid what it is hard to explain, and that while they miss the difficulty they also miss the meaning.<p><span class= "bld">He that believeth on me . . .</span>—We have here an advance on the thought, “If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink.” That represented the satisfaction of the individual mind. This teaches the fuller truth that every one in living communion with Christ becomes himself the centre of spiritual influence. There is in him a power of life which, when quickened by faith, flows forth as a river, carrying life and refreshment to others. No spirit grasps a great truth which satisfies its own yearnings as the waters of the fountain slake physical thirst, without longing to send it forth to others who are seeking what he himself had sought. There is in him a river whose waters no barrier can confine. This is the spirit of the prophet and the evangelist, of the martyr and the missionary. It is the spirit of every great teacher. It is the link which binds men together and makes the life of every Christian approach the life of Christ, for he lives not for himself but for the world.<p>The exact words “Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water,” are not found in any part of the Canonical Scriptures of the Old Testament, and yet Christ Himself utters them with the formula of quotation. This will be a difficulty only to those who value letter and syllable above spirit and substance. It may be that the words which our Lord actually uttered in the current language of Jerusalem were nearer to the very words of some passage in the Old Testament than they seem to be in the Greek form in which St. John has preserved them to us. But it is instructive that the thought is that which our Lord Himself, or St. John as representing Him, considers as the essence of the quotation. The thought meets us again and again in the Old Testament. See the following passages: <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm" title="Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.

The vessel they carried contained but three logs, or about a quart, of water, brought from the tank of Siloam. This was poured through a perforated silver bowl. In the spiritual interpretation the water shall not be carried to the Temple, for every believer shall be a temple of the Holy Ghost and a source of life; it shall not be a limited quantity in vessels of gold and silver, but shall be as rivers bursting forth in their strength and fulness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-38.htm" title="He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water....">John 7:38-39</a></span>. <span class="ital">He that believeth on me </span>— With a living faith, and with <span class="ital">his heart unto righteousness; as the Scripture hath said </span>— As God in the Scriptures hath promised and attested in many places; <span class="ital">out of his belly </span>— From within him, from his mind and heart; <span class="ital">shall flow rivers of living water</span> — He shall receive spiritual blessings, or communications of divine grace, in so great an abundance, that he shall not only be refreshed and comforted himself, but shall be instrumental in refreshing and comforting others. The expression, <span class="ital">Out of his belly shall flow rivers, </span>is used with allusion to receptacles round springs, out of which great quantities of water flow by pipes: and the figure therefore signifies the plenitude of spiritual gifts and graces to be possessed by believers, and the happy effects which they should produce in the world. Thus the apostles and first messengers of Christ were both watered themselves and enabled to water others, Gentiles as well as Jews, not with small streams, but with large rivers of divine knowledge and grace, so that the countries, which till then had been barren, became exceeding fruitful in holiness and righteousness. Accordingly the evangelist adds, by way of explication, <span class="ital">this spake he of the Spirit </span>— Of the Holy Spirit’s gifts and graces; <span class="ital">which they </span>who believed on <span class="ital">him should receive </span>— <span class="greekheb">Εμελλον λαμβανειν</span>, <span class="ital">were about to receive, </span>namely, after the resurrection and ascension of Christ, according to his promise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7</a>. The extraordinary gifts of the Spirit had, in a great measure, ceased since the death of Zechariah and Malachi. They had been faintly manifested in the approach of the Messiah, as to Zechariah and Elizabeth, to Simeon and Anna, and especially to John the Baptist, who is said to have been <span class="ital">filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother’s womb; </span>but the full effusion of these gifts, foretold by Isaiah and Joel, took not place till after the ascension of Christ, and was yet to come. On the day of pentecost, and not before, these extraordinary gifts were communicated to the apostles, evangelists, and many other believers, to fit them for converting the world. The universality, however, of the invitation and promise here given, makes it evident that, on this occasion, our Lord had the ordinary influences of the Spirit in his eye, which the evangelist’s remark, that <span class="ital">the Holy Ghost was not yet given, </span>will not exclude; because, even these might at that time be said not to have been given, as they had been given but sparingly, in comparison of the plentiful distribution which was to be made of them to all believers after Christ’s ascension. Accordingly, the ordinary influences of the Spirit are often in Scripture represented as the consequences and reward of faith, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-14.htm" title="That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.">Galatians 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-12.htm" title="That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ....">Ephesians 1:12-14</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:37-39 On the last day of the feast of tabernacles, the Jews drew water and poured it out before the Lord. It is supposed that Christ alluded to this. If any man desires to be truly and for ever happy, let him apply to Christ, and be ruled by him. This thirst means strong desires after spiritual blessings, which nothing else can satisfy; so the sanctifying and comforting influences of the Holy Spirit, were intended by the waters which Jesus called on them to come to Him and drink. The comfort flows plentifully and constantly as a river; strong as a stream to bear down the opposition of doubts and fears. There is a fulness in Christ, of grace for grace. The Spirit dwelling and working in believers, is as a fountain of living, running water, out of which plentiful streams flow, cooling and cleansing as water. The miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit we do not expect, but for his more common and more valuable influences we may apply. These streams have flowed from our glorified Redeemer, down to this age, and to the remote corners of the earth. May we be anxious to make them known to others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that believeth on me - He that acknowledges me as the Messiah, and trusts in me for salvation.<p>As the scripture hath said - This is a difficult expression, from the fact that no such expression as follows is to be found literally in the Old Testament. Some have proposed to connect it with what precedes - "He that believeth on me, as the Old Testament has commanded or required" - but to this there are many objections. The natural and obvious meaning here is, doubtless, the true one; and Jesus probably intended to say, not that there was any particular place in the Old Testament that affirmed this in so many words, but that this was the substance of what the Scriptures taught, or this was the spirit of their declarations. Hence, the Syriac translates it in the plural - the Scriptures. Probably there is a reference more particularly to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a>, than to any other single passage: "Thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water whose waters fail not." See also <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>.<p>Out of his belly - Out of his midst, or out of his heart. The word "belly" is often put for the midst of a thing, the center, and the heart, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>. It means here that from the man shall flow; that is, his piety shall be of such a nature that it will extend its blessings to others. It shall be like a running fountain - perhaps in allusion to statues or ornamented reservoirs in gardens. in which pipes were placed from which water was continually flowing. The Jews used the same figure: "His two reins are like fountains of water, from which the law flows." And again: "When a man turns himself to the Lord, he shall be as a fountain filled with living water, and his streams shall flow to all the nations and tribes of men" (Kuinoel).<p>Rivers - This word is used to express abundance, or a full supply. It means here that those who are Christians shall diffuse large, and liberal, and constant blessings on their fellow-men; or, as Jesus immediately explains it, that they shall be the instruments by which the Holy Spirit shall be poured down on the world.<p>Living water - Fountains, ever-flowing streams. That is, the gospel shall be constant and life-giving in its blessings. We learn here:<p>1. that it is the nature of Christian piety to be diffusive.<p>2. that no man can believe on Jesus who does not desire that others should also, and who will not seek it.<p>3. that the desire is large and liberal - that the Christian desires the salvation of all the world.<p>4. that the faith of the believer is to be connected with the influence of the Holy Spirit, and in that way Christians are to be like rivers of living water. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. as the scripture hath said&#8212;These words belong to what follows, "Out of his belly, as the scripture hath said, shall flow," &c. referring not to any particular passage, but to such as Isa 58:11; Joe 3:18; Zec 14:8; Eze 47:1-12; in most of which the idea is that of waters issuing from beneath the temple, to which our Lord compares Himself and those who believe in Him.<p>out of his belly&#8212;that is, his inner man, his soul, as in Pr 20:27.<p>rivers of living water&#8212;(See on [1801]Joh 4:13).

Which explains what is meant by coming to Christ, and drinking; for these acts are no other than for a man to go out of himself to Christ, and live by faith on him, and his grace. To which what follows is a great encouragement; <p>as the Scripture hath said: some refer these words to the preceding clause concerning believing in Christ, which the writings of the Old Testament speak of, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, and the sense is, that he that believes on Christ, the object of faith the Scripture points at, and in him, as that directs and requires; that believes in him as the mighty God, and as the prophet, priest, and King, and as the only foundation of the church, and lives by faith upon him, as just men do, then <p>out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water, though rather they belong to what follows; and do not design any particular place of Scripture; for no such one is to be found, where the following passage is expressed in so many words; but all those Scriptures which speak of grace, under the metaphors of water, and abundance of water, as rivers and floods of water, and of the effusion of the Holy Spirit, under such figurative expressions, such as  <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>. Hence the Syriac version reads in the plural number, "as the Scriptures hath said"; referring to more than one: "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water"; the grace of the Spirit of God is signified by water, because it is of a cleansing and purifying nature, as faith and hope are, having to do with the blood of Christ, which cleanses from all sin; and because it fructifies and causes the saints, as trees of righteousness, to grow, and bring forth fruit; and especially because it is cooling to those who are scorched with the heat of a fiery law, and very refreshing to thirsty souls: and it is called "living" water, because by it dead sinners are quickened, drooping saints are revived, and comforted; spiritual life in them is maintained and supported, and it springs up to, and issues in eternal life: and it is expressed by "rivers" of living water, because of the abundance of it in regeneration, justification, and pardon; it is grace for grace, abundance of grace believers receive from Christ; and from him, in whom those large measures of grace are, they "flow out" again, even "out of his belly": from within him, out of his heart, the seat of it, by his lips, both in prayer to God, and in conversation with the saints, to whom he communicates his rich experiences of grace, to their comfort, and the glory of God: for grace is of a diffusive and communicative nature; out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh: and also it flows out by his life and conversation, which is sober, righteous, and godly; and this the grace of God teaches and influences: and this grace, as it is permanent and lasting itself, even perpetual, and always abiding; so it continues to flow, and to show itself in its acts and effects, in one way or another. The Jews ought not to find fault with Christ's using such expressions, mystically understood, since they, comparing Moses and the Messiah together, say, <p>"as the first Redeemer caused a well to spring up, so the last Redeemer shall cause waters to spring up, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a> (e).'' <p>(e) Midrash Kohelet, fol. 63. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that believeth on me, as the <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span><p>(k) The scripture being referred to is not found anywhere word for word, but rather Christ seems to be referring to many different places where mention is made of the gifts of the Holy Spirit; see Joe 2:28-29; Isa 44:3 and especially Isa 55:1-13.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-38.htm" title="He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.">John 7:38</a>.

To think in particular of those passages in which mention is made of a stream flowing from the temple mount, the believer being represented as a living temple (Olshausen), is a gloss unwarranted by the context, and presents an inappropriate comparison (<span class="greekheb">κοιλίας</span>). This last is also in answer to Gieseler (in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1829, p. 138 f.), whom Lange, <span class="ital">L. J</span>. II. p. 945, follows. To imagine some <span class="ital">apocryphal</span> or lost canonical saying (Whiston, Semler, Paulus; comp. also Weizsäcker, p. 518; Bleek, p. 234, and in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1853, p. 331), or, as Ewald does, a fragment of Proverbs no longer extant, or of some such similar book, is too bold and unnecessary, considering the freedom with whieh passages of Scripture are quoted and combined, and the absence of any other certain trace in the discourses of Jesus of extra-canonical quotations, or of canonical quotations not now to be found in the O. T.; although, indeed, the characteristic <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας αὐτοῦ</span> itself occurs in none of the above-named places, which is certainly surprising, and not to be explained by an inappropriate reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/7-3.htm" title="Your two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.">Song of Solomon 7:3</a> (Hengstenberg). But this expression, “<span class="ital">out of his body</span>” considering the connection of the metaphor, is very natural; the water which he drinks becomes in his body a spring from which streams of living water flow, <span class="ital">i.e. the divine grace and truth which the believer has received out of Christ’s fulness into his inner life, does not remain shut up within, but will communicate itself in abundant measure as a life-giving stream to others</span>, and thus the new divine life overflows from one individual on to others. As represented in the metaphor, these <span class="greekheb">ποταμοί</span> take their rise from the water which has been drunk and is <span class="ital">in</span> the <span class="greekheb">κοιλία</span>, and flow forth <span class="ital">therefrom</span> in an <span class="ital">oral</span> effusion;[270] for the effect referred to takes plaee in an outward direction <span class="ital">by</span> an inspired <span class="ital">oral</span> communication of one’s own experience of God’s grace and truth (<span class="greekheb">πιστεύομεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">διὸ καὶ λαλοῦμεν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-13.htm" title="We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;">2 Corinthians 4:13</a>). The mutual and inspired intercourse of Christians from Pentecost downwards, the speaking in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, the mutual edification in Christian assemblies by means of the charismata even to the speaking with tongues, the entire work of the apostles, of a Stephen and so on, furnish an abundant historical commentary upon this text. It is clear, accordingly, that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΙΛΊΑ</span></span></span> does not, as is <span class="ital">usually</span> supposed, denote the <span class="ital">inner</span> man, man’s <span class="ital">heart</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-27.htm" title="The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.">Proverbs 20:27</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/19-12.htm" title="As an arrow that sticketh in a man's thigh, so is a word within a fool's belly.">Sir 19:12</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/51-21.htm" title="My heart was troubled in seeking her: therefore have I gotten a good possession.">Sir 51:21</a>; LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-9.htm" title="I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: see, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, you know.">Psalm 40:9</a>, following A.; comp. the Latin <span class="ital">viscera</span>), but must be left in its literal meaning “<span class="ital">belly</span>” in conformity with the <span class="ital">metaphor</span> which determines the expression.[271] The flowing forth of the water, moreover, is not to be understood as something operating upon the <span class="ital">subject himself</span> only (B. Crusius: “his whole soul, from its very depth, shall have a continual quickening and satisfaction,” comp. Maier), but as describing an efficacy <span class="ital">in an outward direction</span>, as <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κοιλ</span>. shows, and therefore is not the same as the similar passage, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm" title="But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.">John 4:14</a>. If we join <span class="greekheb">ὁ πιστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἐμέ</span> with inverts, <span class="greekheb">πινέτω</span>, <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> must refer to Christ; and this is the meaning that we get: “He that thirsteth, let him come to me; and he that believeth in me, let him drink of me: for to me refers what the Scripture hath said concerning a river which shall flow forth from Jehovah in the time of the Messiah.” So Hahn, <span class="ital">Theol. d. N. T</span>. I. p. 229 f., and Gess, <span class="ital">Pers. Chr</span>. p. 166. But against this it is decisive, first, that he who believes on Jesus <span class="ital">has</span> already <span class="ital">drunk</span> of Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-35.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.">John 6:35</a>), and the call to come and drink must apply not to the believer, but to the thirsty; and secondly, that the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῆς κοιλίας αὐτοῦ</span> would be unnecessary and unmeaning, if it referred to Jesus, and not to <span class="ital">him</span> who has performed the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΙΝΈΤΩ</span></span></span> (Nonnus, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΓΑΣΤΡῸς ἘΚΕΊΝΟΥ</span></span></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὝΔΩΡ ΖῶΝ</span></span></span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-10.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.">John 4:10</a>; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖῶΝΤΟς ΔῈ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἬΓΟΥΝ ἈΕῚ ἘΝΕΡΓΟῦΝΤΟς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἈΕΙΚΙΝΉΤΟΥ</span></span></span>, Euthymius Zigabenus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe further the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΤΑΜΟΊ</span></span></span> emphatically taking the lead and standing apart; “not in spoonfuls, nor with a pipe and tap, but in full streams,” Luther.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[270] Comp. <span class="greekheb">ἐρεύξομαι</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-35.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.">Matthew 13:35</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[271] Already Chrysostom and his followers took <span class="greekheb">κοιλίας</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">καρδίας</span>; a confounding of the metaphor with its import. Hofmann’s objection (<span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 13), “that the water here meant does not go into the belly at all,” rests solely upon the same confusion of the figure with its meaning. According to the figure, it conies into the <span class="greekheb">κοιλία</span> because it is <span class="ital">drunk</span>, and this drinking is in like manner <span class="ital">figurative</span>. When Hofmann finds indicated in the word even a <span class="ital">springing place</span> of the Holy Spirit <span class="ital">within the body</span>, he cannot get rid of the idea of something withia the <span class="ital">body</span> as being implied in <span class="greekheb">κοιλία</span>, because the text itself presents this figure as being in harmony with that of the <span class="ital">drinking;</span> unless, indeed, the concrete expression is to give way to an exegetical prudery foreign to the text itself, and is to be blotted out at pleasure. <span class="greekheb">κοιλία</span> in <span class="ital">no</span> passage of the N. T. means anything else than <span class="ital">body, belly</span>.—Strangely out of keeping with the unity of the figure, Lange, following Bengel (comp. also Weizsäcker), now finds in <span class="greekheb">κοιλία</span> an allusion to the <span class="ital">belly of the golden pitcher</span> (see on ver. 37), and Godet to the <span class="ital">inner hollow of the rock</span> whence the water flowed, so that <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κοιλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> corresponds with מִמֶּנּוּ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm" title="Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.

The words seem to intimate that the believer shall not only have his own thirst quenched, but shall be a source of new streams for the good of others (O. Holtzmann). A remarkably analogous saying is quoted by Schoettgen from the Talmud: “Quando homo se convertit ad Dominum suum, tanquam fons aquis vivis impletur, et fluenta ejus egrediuntur ad omnis generis homines et ad omnes tribus”. At the same time it is not easy to see the relevancy of the saying if this meaning be attached to it, and the saying of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm" title="But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.">John 4:14</a> is so similar that it seems preferable to understand it in the same sense, of the inseparableness and inwardness of the living water.

But none of them contain the very remarkable expression ‘out of his belly.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">rivers of living water</span>] In the Greek ‘rivers’ stands first with strong emphasis; <span class="ital">rivers out of his belly shall flow</span>, (rivers) <span class="ital">of living water</span>, in marked contrast to the <span class="ital">ewer</span> of water poured each day during the Feast. ‘He that believeth on me’ is of course a stage far in advance of ‘if any one thirst.’ A man may thirst for spiritual satisfaction, and yet not end in believing on Christ. But the believer cannot end in satisfying his own thirst; he at once becomes a fount whence others may derive refreshment. Whether he wills to be a teacher or no, the true Christian cannot fail to impart the spirit of Christianity to others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-38.htm" title="He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.">John 7:38</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμέ</span>, <span class="ital">He that believeth on Me</span>) <span class="ital">To believe</span> is not parallel to the verb, <span class="ital">to thirst</span>, but to the verb, <span class="ital">to come</span>; ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-35.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.">John 6:35</a>.

This is not the first time that Christ has represented believing under the form of both "coming" and "drinking." The one term seems to cover that part of faith in Christ which unites the soul to him, which sides with him, which utterly abandons self to take his word as true and his power as sufficient; the other term, when applied to participation in his blood, implies receiving into the soul the full solace of his imparted life. <span class="accented">He that believeth on me, <span class="cmt_word"></span>as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall rush torrents of living water.</span> From his newly given, divinely imparted life shall proceed, as from the innermost depths of his consciousness, illimitable supplies of refreshment and fertility for others as well. Each soul will be a rock smitten in the thirsty land, from which crystal rivers of life-giving grace shall flow. Godet urges, against Meyer, the great sufficiency of this particular illustration of the rock in the wilderness as justifying the reference to the phrase, "as the Scripture hath said," and points especially to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>, "Behold, I will stand before thee there...  in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and out of it (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) water shall come, that the people may drink" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-8.htm">Psalm 114:8</a>; passages read during the feast).

It is certain that the numerous passages in the Old Testament, in which the gift of refreshing water is made the symbol of national mercies and spiritual blessings, do, for the most part, fall short of this remarkable expression. Still, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>, all more or less approach the thought; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1-12</a>, where from the altar the living, health giving, mighty river flows for the healing of the nations, is so akin to the saying of the Lord, as soon as we recognize the fact that he is greater than the temple, and that his Church is God's temple, and each body of man a temple of the Holy Ghost, that all real difficulty vanishes. The whole history of the Church is one continuous comment and illustration of the exhaustless fulness of his Word. Just as a soul of man comes and drinks of the water of life, he becomes himself a perennial source of life to others. He supplies not cisterns of stagnant water, but rivers of living water (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). Chrysostom adds, "One may perceive what is meant, if he will consider the wisdom of Stephen, the tongue of Peter, the vehemence of Paul; how nothing withstood them - not the anger of multitudes, nor the uprising of tyrants, nor plots of devils, nor daily deaths - but, as rivers borne along with loud rushing sound, they went on their way." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The scripture hath said<p>There is no exactly corresponding passage, but the quotation harmonizes with the general tenor of several passages, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-1.htm">Ezekiel 47:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>.<p>Belly (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>The word is often used in the Old Testament for the innermost part of a man, the soul or heart.
