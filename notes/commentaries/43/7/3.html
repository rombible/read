But as they were in the "upper room" among the one hundred and twenty disciples who waited for the descent of the Spirit after the Lord's ascension (Ac 1:14), they seem to have had their prejudices removed, perhaps after His resurrection. Indeed here their language is more that of strong prejudice and suspicion (such as near relatives, even the best, too frequently show in such cases), than from unbelief. There was also, probably, a tincture of vanity in it. "Thou hast many disciples in Judea; here in Galilee they are fast dropping off; it is not like one who advances the claims Thou dost to linger so long here, away from the city of our solemnities, where surely 'the kingdom of our father David' is to be set up: 'seeking,' as Thou dost, 'to be known openly,' those miracles of Thine ought not to be confined to this distant corner, but submitted at headquarters to the inspection of 'the world.'"

The Jew (l) therefore is mistaken, who supposed the above persons are here intended; and objects this their unbelief to Jesus, as if they knew him too well to give him any credit; whereas they did believe in him, and abode by him to the last; and some of them, if not all, suffered death for his sake. They therefore are to be understood of some distant relations of Mary or Joseph, that dwelt at Nazareth, or Capernaum, or in some of those parts; and the feast of tabernacles being at hand, they put him upon going up to it, being willing to be rid of him: saying, <p>depart hence: which is the language of carnal men, who desire not the company of Christ, nor the knowledge of his ways; and like the Gergesenes, who preferred their swine to Christ, and desired him to depart out of their coasts: <p>and go into Judea; among his most inveterate enemies, who sought to take away his life; and which doubtless they knew; which showed a quite different regard to him, from that of his true disciples,  <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-7.htm">John 11:7</a>, for which they give some plausible reasons: <p>that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest: meaning not his twelve disciples, who were now with him, but the disciples he had made, and baptized in Judea, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a>.

A malicious and treacherous intention (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἀναιρεθῇ παρᾶ τῶν ζητούντων ἀποκτεῖναι αὐτόν</span>, Euthymius Zigabenus, also Luther) is imputed to them without any foundation. They are of cold Jewish natures, and the higher nature belonging to their Brother is as yet hidden from them. The light of faith seems not to have dawned upon them until after His resurrection, and by means of that event (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-7.htm" title="After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.">1 Corinthians 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>). This long-continued unbelief of His own earthly brothers (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm" title="And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.">Mark 3:21</a>) is important in estimating the genuineness of the accounts given in Matthew and Luke of the miraculous birth and early childhood of Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ οἱ μαθηταί σου</span>] This expression entirely corresponds with the position of the brothers as <span class="ital">outside</span> the fellowship of Jesus. It does not say, “thy disciples <span class="ital">there</span> also” (so <span class="ital">usually;</span> even Baur, who takes it to refer to those who are first to be won over in Judaea), for the word <span class="ital">there</span> does not occur, nor “thy disciples <span class="ital">collectively</span>,” but simply, “thy disciples also.” They would be gathered together from all parts at the feast in Jerusalem, and He should let Himself and His works be seen <span class="ital">by them also</span>. It does not, indeed, clearly appear from this that coldness began to be exhibited towards Him within the circle of His disciples (Weizsäcker), but rather perhaps that Jesus had gone about in Galilee and worked miracles very much in secret, without attracting observation, and not attended by any great following, but perhaps only by the trusted twelve, which silent manner of working He was perhaps led to adopt by the lying in wait of the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-1.htm" title="After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.">John 7:1</a>). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-4.htm" title="For there is no man that does any thing in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.">John 7:4</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐν κρυπτῷ</span>. According to B. Crusius, the brothers speak as it nothing miraculous had been done by Him in Galilee. Contrary to the narrative; and therefore <span class="greekheb">ἃ ποιεῖς</span> cannot mean “what you are <span class="ital">reported</span> to have done” (B. Crusius), but “<span class="ital">what thou doest,” i.e</span>. during thy present sojourn in Galilee, although <span class="greekheb">ἐν κρυπτῷ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-4.htm" title="For there is no man that does any thing in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.">John 7:4</a>. According to Brückner (comp. Ebrard, and substantially also Godet), the brothers express themselves as if Jesus had made and retained no disciples in Galilee, and, indeed, with malicious and ironical allusion to the fact stated <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-66.htm" title="From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.">John 6:66</a>, and to the report (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm" title="When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,">John 4:1</a>) which they did not believe. But, considering the long interval which elapsed between chap. 6 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-2.htm" title="Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.">John 7:2</a>, such allusions, without more precise indication of them in the text, are all the less to be assumed. Luthardt attributes to the brothers the notion that in Galilee it was only the multitudes that followed Him, and that there was no such personal adherence to Him as had taken place in Judaea (in consequence of His baptizing). But it is incredible that they should entertain a notion so obviously <span class="ital">erroneous</span>, because the events which they were continually witnessing in Galilee, as well as those which they witnessed in Judaea on occasion of their journeys to the feast, must have been better known to them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[257] Hengstenberg is not deterred even by this passage from recognising in these <span class="ital">brothers</span> of Jesus His <span class="ital">cousins</span> (the sons, he thinks, of Cleopas and Mary; but see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a>), and from maintaining, with all the arbitrariness and violence of exegetical impossibilities, that three of them, James, Simon, and Judas, were apostles, in spite of vv. 3, 5, 7 (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-19.htm" title="If you were of the world, the world would love his own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.">John 15:19</a>). Against every attempt to explain away the literal brothers and sisters of Jesus, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-25.htm" title="And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.">Matthew 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.">Matthew 12:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; also Laurentius, <span class="ital">N.

The desirableness of doing so is urged by His brothers. <span class="greekheb">εἶπον</span> … <span class="greekheb">τῷ κόσμῳ</span>. The reason they advanced was “that Thy disciples also may see Thy works which Thou doest”. <span class="greekheb">καὶ οἱ μαθηταί σου</span> seems to imply that since the Feeding of the Five Thousand in April, Jesus had been living in comparative retirement, perhaps at Nazareth. At Jerusalem, all who were attached to Him would be found at the Feast; and the brothers recognise that He would then have an opportunity of putting His claims to the proof. “No one,” they say, “who seeks public recognition confines his activities to a hidden and private corner.” <span class="greekheb">ἐν παρρησίᾳ</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm" title="Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went there to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.">John 11:54</a>, means “openly” or “in public,” and is in direct contrast to <span class="greekheb">ἐν κρυπτῷ</span>. Having laid down the general law, they then apply it to Him, “if (or ‘since,’ not expressing doubt) Thou doest these things, show Thyself to the world”. Lücke, following Euthymius, thinks doubt is implied in <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span>; but this implies an ignorance on the part of the brothers which is inconceivable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">His brethren</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-12.htm" title="After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.">John 2:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Depart hence</span>] The bluntness of this suggestion, given almost as a command, shews that they presumed upon their near relationship. It would be more natural in the mouths of men <span class="ital">older</span> than Christ, and therefore is in favour of their being sons of Joseph by a former marriage rather than sons of Joseph and Mary (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm" title="And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.">Mark 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-31.htm" title="There came then his brothers and his mother, and, standing without, sent to him, calling him.">Mark 3:31</a>). They shared the ordinary beliefs of the Jews about the Messiah, and therefore did not believe in their Brother. But His miracles perplexed them, and they wished the point brought to a decisive issue.

The lack of sympathy shown by these men, and the positive assertion of their non-belief  in Jesus, is incompatible with the great confession so recently made (ch. 6:68, 69), and cannot (with Hengstenberg and Lange) be diluted into imperfect appreciation of claims which they wished in a secular sense to press forward to full assertion. They appeared here to criticize their Brother's prolonged absence from Jerusalem, and his abstention from the Passover and other national festivals. They would, perhaps sincerely, hurry forward his public demonstration, and compel him to say to the great world what he had been saying in Galilaean villages, in the borders of Tyre, and in the cities of Decapolis. <span class="cmt_word">Depart hence, and go into Judaea</span>. "This is the time and place." Thoma sees in this advice the same idea which, on the mount of Transfiguration, was suggested by Moses and Elijah "concerning the departure which the Lord was to accomplish in Jerusalem." The Johannist has clothed the same material insinuation in a dialogue (<span class="accented">dialogische Verhandlung</span>). It has been said that this kind of advice is rather in favour of the hypothesis that these brethren were elder than Jesus, and possibly the children of Joseph by an earlier marriage, who thus took upon themselves the function of advisers. Such a hint, however (given by Westcott), seems very shadowy confirmation of the theory. Younger brothers would be just as likely to err in the same direction. <span class="cmt_word">In order that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.</span> The words "thy disciples" may (Godet, Luthardt formerly) have had special reference to the fact that our Lord had made in Judaea "more disciples than had John" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a>), that there were even members of the Sanhedrin who had to some extent looked favourably upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1</a>), and needed confirmation of their faith. There may also have been tacit reference to the circumstance recorded in ch. 6. that his <span class="accented">Galilaean</span> disciples had deserted him; but it is more likely (Meyer) that the brethren took it for granted that those who in numerous places had received his word would be gathered together in Jerusalem, and would have an opportunity of seeing with their own eyes and in consociation with each other the works of healing and might which were being variously reported, canvassed, and disputed in the schools of Galilee. "Thy disciples" is a wide word, and may easily refer to all who, whether in Jerusalem or Galilee, went by his name. It is a designation which, however, does not include the speakers. "The works which thou art doing" is sufficiently illustrated from the group of remarkable events which had eternalized the previous twelve months of the Galilaean ministry (see on ver. 1). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Thy disciples<p>Both those who had been gained by former teaching in Judaea and Jerusalem, and others from other parts. </body></html>
