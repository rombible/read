The persons who thus sought to take Him are, of course, the members of the Sanhedrin. The people are mentioned in contrast in the next verse. For the present their efforts are confined to plots. No one attempts to use actual force.<p><span class= "bld">His hour was not yet come.</span>—This is the writer’s explanation of the fact that they did not seek to take Him. Jesus had Himself used these words at the first sign at Cana of Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-4.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.">John 2:4</a>), and again before going up to this very festival (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.">John 7:6</a>). The beloved disciple has learnt the religious interpretation of history. That the hour was not yet come, was not the immediate cause which influenced those who desired, but dared not, to lay hands upon Him. The next verse points out that there was a division in the multitude (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-43.htm" title="So there was a division among the people because of him.">John 7:43-44</a>), and in the uncertainty of what the consequences may be, no one was bold enough to take the decisive step. But if not the immediate cause, the writer regards it as the primary cause. Looking back on the life of his Lord, from the old age of his own life, so full of eventful issues, he has learnt that every deed of that life, as every deed of every life, had its hour mapped out in the eternal counsels of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-30.htm" title="Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come....">John 7:30-32</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then they sought to take him — </span>“The defence which he made did not pacify his enemies, for some of them would gladly have apprehended him; however, none of them had the courage to lay hands on him, being restrained by Providence, because the season of his sufferings was not yet come.” <span class="ital">And many of the people believed on him </span>— “In the mean time the miracle which he had lately performed on the infirm man was so great and so well known, and this defence, by which he justified himself, so clear and convincing, that many of the people believed on him publicly affirming, that he was the Messiah.” <span class="ital">The Pharisees heard that the people murmured </span>— Or, <span class="ital">whispered, </span>rather, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-12.htm" title="And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.">John 7:12</a>; <span class="ital">such things concerning him </span>— And were greatly displeased and alarmed at it; and, with the other members of the sanhedrim, particularly the chief priests, among whom were many Sadducees, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-1.htm" title="And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came on them,">Acts 4:1</a>,) <span class="ital">sent officers </span>— From the chamber in which they held their council, into the adjacent court of the temple; <span class="ital">to take him </span>— To apprehend and bring him before them, thinking thus, it seems, to confute his pretensions, and punish him.

By force, and carry him before the sanhedrim, in order to be tried and condemned as a blasphemer, being enraged to hear him claim a descent from God, whom they took to be a mere man, the son of Joseph the carpenter: <p>but no man laid hands on him; though they had a good will to it, they had no power to do it, being restrained by the, secret providence of God from it, and awed by the majesty of Christ, which showed itself in his looks and words; and perhaps also they might be afraid of the people, lest they should rise in his favour; and so every man being fearful of being the first that should seize him, no man did: however, so it was ordered by divine providence, that he should not be apprehended at, this time, <p>because his hour was not yet come; to suffer and die, to depart out of this world, and go to the Father: there was a precise time fixed for this in the council and covenant of God, by mutual compact, called "due time"; as his coming into the world is called "the fulness of time"; nor could he die before that time, and therefore no man was suffered to lay hands on him, whatever good will he had to it. And there is a time for every man's death, nor can any man die before that time, or live beyond it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a>; and this is the sense of the ancient Jews; for they say (h), <p>"a man before his years, or his time, does not die;'' <p>that is, before he comes to the years appointed for him: and they ask (i), <p>"who is there that goes before his time? i.e. dies before his time?'' <p>And it is said (k) of a certain person who was in his house, and  , "his time was come"; and he died without sickness: though it must be owned some of them were otherwise minded, and say (l), that death, by the hand of heaven, or God, shortens a man's years; and that there are some reasons for which righteous men depart out of this world before their time is come; and particularly of Enoch they say, God took him before his time was come (m). <p>(h) T.

The reason here assigned is that higher religious apprehension of the history, which does not, however, contradict or exclude the immediate historical cause, viz. that through fear—not of conscience (Hengstenberg, Godet), but of the party who were favourably inclined to Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-31.htm" title="And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ comes, will he do more miracles than these which this man has done?">John 7:31</a>—they dared not yet lay hands on Him.
