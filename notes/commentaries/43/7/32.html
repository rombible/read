They see that faith in Him is spreading among the multitude, and that there is no time to be lost. They hastily call together the Sanhedrin, and the chief priests, who were for the most part Sadducees, join with them in an official resolve to take Him by force.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:31-36 The discourses of Jesus convinced many that he was the Messiah; but they had not courage to own it. It is comfort to those who are in the world, but not of it, and therefore are hated by it and weary of it, that they shall not be in it always, that they shall not be in it long. Our days being evil, it is well they are few. The days of life and of grace do not last long; and sinners, when in misery, will be glad of the help they now despise.

Then, Jesus means, the tables will be turned; after they had persecuted and killed Him who now was present, they then would anxiously long, but in vain, for Him, the absent One,[267] as the wonder-working helper, who alone could save them from the dire calamity.

But even in these the seeking and finding is not a mere figure of speech; and here such a weakening of the signification is all the more inadmissible, because it is not <span class="ital">annihilation</span>, as in those passages, which is here depicted, and because the following words, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὅπου εἰμὶ ἐγὼ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., describe a <span class="ital">longing</span> which was not to be satisfied. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-22.htm" title="And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.">Luke 17:22</a> is analogous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ὅπου εἰμὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] still more clearly describes the tragic <span class="greekheb">οὐχ εὑρήσ</span>.: “and where <span class="ital">I</span> (then) am, thither <span class="ital">ye</span> cannot come,” <span class="ital">i.e</span>. in order to find me as a deliverer, or to flee to me.

The "chief priests" - a phrase often occurring in the writings of Luke, and here for the first time in this Gospel - cannot be confined to the official "high priest," but may include the ex-high priests, perhaps the heads of the twenty-four courses of priests and the chiefs of the priestly party, though there is no proof of it. The Pharisees and priests were often at enmity, but there were several occasions during our Lord's ministry when they combined against a common foe. The Pharisees had been his most steady opponents in Galilee. The eighth and ninth chapters of Matthew, with parallel passages, reveal the growing animosity of their demeanour, and their disposition to misunderstand, to oppose, and to crush every great self-revelation made by him. Their chiefs were in Jerusalem, and doubtless formed a powerful element in the great council. The formality of this session of the council may be reasonably questioned. There had been orders then for the arrest, which they had only to put at any time, if they dared, into immediate operation. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Officers (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a>. </body></html>
