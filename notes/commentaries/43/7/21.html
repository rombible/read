They, too, though not in the same degree, were led by it to take a hostile position.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel....">John 7:21-24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jesus answered, I have done one </span>good <span class="ital">work, and ye all marvel </span>— I have done a miracle of an extraordinary kind on the sabbath day, an action which ye think inconsistent with the character of a good man, and therefore ye wonder that I should have performed it. But I can easily vindicate my character, by an argument which it is not in your power to gainsay. <span class="ital">Moses therefore gave you circumcision </span>— That is, the law of circumcision. Dr. Campbell joins the words <span class="greekheb">δαι τουτο</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">therefore, </span>to the end of the former verse, following Theophylact, and some whom he terms “our best authors,” observing, that “nothing can be more incongruously connected than the words are in the English, and most other modern translations; where our Lord’s performing a miracle is represented as the cause why Moses gave them circumcision.” Thus also Doddridge, Wesley, Wynne, and Worsley, who translate the last clause of the preceding verse, <span class="ital">I have done one work, and ye all marvel at it, </span>or, <span class="ital">on account of it. </span>If we retain the common pointing, as all the versions do, the interpretation of this verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-22.htm" title="Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.">John 7:22</a>) must be, <span class="ital">Because that Moses gave you </span>the precept concerning <span class="ital">circumcision, </span>ye even <span class="ital">circumcise a man on the sabbath day. </span>But the correction just now proposed makes the sense more clear and elegant, thus: <span class="ital">Moses gave you the law of circumcision, </span>(though indeed it was far more ancient than he, being a precept enjoined to and observed by, the patriarchs,) <span class="ital">and on the sabbath day ye circumcise a man. If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken </span>— The precept of circumcision required, that every male should be circumcised the eighth day from his birth. Though the eighth day happened on the sabbath, this ceremony was not deferred: and the law of circumcision vacated the law of the sabbath. <span class="ital">Are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole </span>— Or, have made a whole man sound; <span class="ital">on the sabbath day? </span>— Since you think yourselves bound to dispense with the strict observation of the sabbath for the sake of another precept, which is only of a ceremonial nature, how can ye be angry with me, because, in pursuance of the great end of all the divine laws, I have cured a man who was infirm in all his members, and that with far less bodily labour than that with which you perform the ceremony of circumcision, and cure the wound that is made by it? <span class="ital">Judge not according to the appearance, </span>&c. — Consider the nature of the things, and judge impartially, without regard to your own prejudices, or the superstition of your teachers. Dr. Campbell renders the clause, <span class="ital">Judge not from personal regards, </span>thinking that translation gives more exactly the sense of the original expression, <span class="greekheb">μη κρινετε κατ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">οψιν</span>. “There can be no question,” says he, “that this precept is of the same import with those which enjoin strict impartiality between the parties, or to have no respect of persons in judgment. The application of it is obvious on this occasion. If the Jews had been strictly impartial and equitable, they would have seen that they could not vindicate Moses for enjoining such a violation of the sabbatical rest as was occasioned by circumcising, while they condemned Jesus for his miraculous cures, which required less labour, and were not less evidently calculated for promoting a good end. Nay, they could not excuse themselves for the one practice, if Jesus was blameable for the other.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:14-24 Every faithful minister may humbly adopt Christ's words. His doctrine is not his own finding out, but is from God's word, through the teaching of his Spirit. And amidst the disputes which disturb the world, if any man, of any nation, seeks to do the will of God, he shall know whether the doctrine is of God, or whether men speak of themselves. Only those who hate the truth shall be given up to errors which will be fatal. Surely it was as agreeable to the design of the sabbath to restore health to the afflicted, as to administer an outward rite. Jesus told them to decide on his conduct according to the spiritual import of the Divine law.

Only we must not take them either as <span class="ital">superfluous</span> (Euthymius Zigabenus) or as <span class="ital">elliptical</span>: “therefore <span class="ital">hear</span>,” or “<span class="ital">know</span>” (Grotius, Jansen, even Winer, p. 58 [E. T. p. 68]); the former is inadmissible, the latter is neither Johannean nor in keeping with what follows, which does not contain a declaration, but a deduction of a logical kind. We ought rather, with Bengel (“<span class="ital">propterea</span>, hoc mox declaratur per <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΧ ὍΤΙ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">nempe non quia</span>”) and Luthardt, following Cyril, to regard them as standing in connection with the following <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ὅτι</span>. With this anticipatory <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>, Jesus begins to diminish the astonishment which His healing on the Sabbath had awakened, showing it to be <span class="ital">unreasonable</span>, and this by the <span class="ital">analogy of circumcision</span>, which is performed also on the Sabbath. Instead of simply saying, “<span class="ital">because it comes from the fathers</span>,” He puts the main statement, already introduced by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ ΤΟῦΤΟ</span></span></span>, and so important in the argument, both <span class="ital">negatively</span> and <span class="ital">positively</span>, and says, “<span class="ital">Therefore</span> Moses gave you circumcision, <span class="ital">not because it originated with Moses, but (because it originated) with the fathers</span>, and so ye circumcise” (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ</span></span></span> consecutive), etc.; that is, this <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΧ ὍΤΙ</span></span></span>, on to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΑΤΈΡΩΝ</span></span></span>, serves to show that circumcision, though divinely commanded by Moses in the law, and thus given to the Jews as a ritualistic observance, was not Mosaic in its origin, but was an <span class="ital">old patriarchal</span> institution dating back even from Abraham. The basis of its historic claim to validity lies in the fact that the law of circumcision <span class="ital">precedes</span> the law of the Sabbath, and consequently the enjoined rest of the Sabbath must <span class="ital">give way</span> to circumcision.[264] Even the Rabbins had this axiom: “<span class="ital">Circumcisio pellit sabbatum</span>,” and based it upon the fact that it was “<span class="ital">traditio partum</span>.” See Wetstein on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-23.htm" title="If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are you angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?">John 7:23</a>. The anger of the people on account of the <span class="ital">healing</span> on the Sabbath rested on a false <span class="ital">estimate</span> of the Sabbath; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm" title="Or have you not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?">Matthew 12:5</a>. From this explanation it is at the same time clear that <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ὅτι</span> … <span class="greekheb">πατέρων</span> is not of the nature of a parenthesis (so usually, even Lachmann). Of those who so regard it, some rightly recognise in the words the authority of circumcision as <span class="ital">outweighing</span> that of the Sabbath; while others, against the context, infer from them its <span class="ital">lesser sanctity</span> as being a traditional institution (Paulus, B. Crusius, Ewald, Godet). Others, again, take them as an (objectless) <span class="ital">correction</span> (De Wette, Baeumlein), or as an <span class="ital">historical</span> observation (equally superfluous) of Jesus (Tholuck, Hengstenberg, and earlier expositors) or of John (Lücke, cf. Ebrard). Above all, it would have been very strange and paltry to suppose (with Hengstenberg) that Jesus by this remark was endeavouring, with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-15.htm" title="And the Jews marveled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?">John 7:15</a>, to do away with the <span class="ital">appearance of ignorance</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Μωϋσῆς</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-3.htm" title="And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.">Leviticus 12:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐχ ὅτι</span>] not as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-46.htm" title="Not that any man has seen the Father, save he which is of God, he has seen the Father.">John 6:46</a>, but as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-6.htm" title="This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bore what was put therein.">John 12:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ Μωϋσέως</span>] Instead of saying <span class="greekheb">ἐξ αὐτοῦ</span>, Jesus repeats the <span class="ital">name</span>, thus giving more emphasis to the thought.

Comp. the Rabbinical quotations in Lightfoot. Being emphatic, it takes the lead.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[262] How does he make out the <span class="greekheb">ἓν ἔργον</span>? It is the one miracle which Christ came to accomplish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm" title="Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from you.">Matthew 12:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-1.htm" title="The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.">Matthew 16:1</a> sqq.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-29.htm" title="And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.">Luke 11:29</a> ff.), described by Him metaphorically as a Sabbath healing; this the evangelist has taken for a single miraculous act. See <span class="ital">Evangelienfr</span>. p. 249.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[263] This accounts for the omission of <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> in א Tisch. deletes it, and with א* reads <span class="greekheb">ὁ Μωϋσ</span>. (with the article).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[264] The patriarchal period wag indeed that of <span class="ital">promise</span>, but this is not <span class="ital">made prominent</span> here, and we cannot therefore say with Luthardt: “Jesus puts the law and the promise over-against one another, like Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>.” There is no hint of this in the text. Judging from the text, there rather lies in <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ὅτι</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., the proof that, in the case of a collision between the two laws, that of circumcision and that of the Sabbath, the former must have the precedence, because, though enjoined by <span class="ital">Moses</span>, it already had a <span class="ital">patriarchal</span> origin, and on account of this older sanctity it must suffer no infringement through the law of the Sabbath. Nonnus well describes the argumentation by the words <span class="greekheb">ἀρχεγόνῳ τινὶ θεσμῷ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.">John 7:21</a>. Jesus prefers to expose the unjustifiable character of the hostility which pursued Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-16.htm" title="Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.">John 7:16</a>). Referring to the miracle wrought at Bethesda, and which gave occasion to this hostility, He says <span class="greekheb">ἕν ἔργον</span> … <span class="greekheb">σαββάτω</span>. One single work I did and ye all marvel [are horrified or scandalised]; for this same object, of imparting health, Moses gave you circumcision, an ordinance that continues through all the generations and regularly sets aside the Sabbath law. If circumcision is performed, lest the law of Moses be broken, are ye angry at me for making a man every whit whole [or rather, for making an entire or whole man healthy] on the Sabbath day? The argument is obvious; and its force is brought out by the antithetical form of the sentence: the <span class="greekheb">ἕν ἔργον</span> of the healing of the impotent man is contrasted with the continuous ordinance of circumcision, and so the aorist is used of the one, the perfect of the other. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-23.htm" title="If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are you angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?">John 7:23</a> <span class="greekheb">περιτομὴν λαμβάνει</span> is contrasted with <span class="greekheb">ὅλον ἄνθρωπον ὑγιῆ</span>, the partial and symbolic with the complete and actual soundness. The argument is all the more telling because a “vis medicatrix,” as well as a ceremonial purity (but <span class="ital">vide</span> Meyer), was ascribed to circumcision [“praeputium est vitium in corpore”]. Wetstein quotes from a Rabbi a singularly analogous argument: “Si circumcisio, quae fit in uno membrorum 248 hominis, pellit Sabbatum, quanto magis verum est, conservationem vitae Sabbatum pellere?” The parenthesis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-22.htm" title="Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.">John 7:22</a>, <span class="greekheb">οὐχ ὅτι</span> … <span class="greekheb">πατέρων</span>, is apparently thrown in for accuracy’s sake, lest some captious persons should divert attention from the argument by objecting to the statement that Moses had “given” them circumcision. The reference of <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> in the same verse is obscure. Some editors join these words with <span class="greekheb">θαυμάζετε</span>; but although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-6.htm" title="And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.">Mark 6:6</a> <span class="greekheb">διά</span> follows <span class="greekheb">θαυμάζειν</span>, this construction does not occur in John. Besides, John frequently begins his sentences with <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>; and if <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-22.htm" title="Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.">John 7:22</a> begins with <span class="greekheb">Μωσῆς</span>, such a commencement is certainly abrupt. Retaining <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> as part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-22.htm" title="Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.">John 7:22</a>, the words might be understood thus: “I have done one work and ye all marvel: therefore (be it known unto you) Moses has given you,” etc., <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “I will remove your astonishment: you yourselves perform circumcision,” etc. See Winer, p. 68. So Holtzmann, and Weizsäcker, who renders: “Darum: Moses hat euch,” etc. This gives a good sense, but surely the ellipsis is too severe. Holtzmann’s reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-65.htm" title="And he said, Therefore said I to you, that no man can come to me, except it were given to him of my Father.">John 6:65</a> tells rather against it, for there <span class="greekheb">εἴρηκα</span> is added. May <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> not mean, “on this account,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, for the same reason as I had in healing the impotent man, did Moses give you circumcision? I did one work of healing and ye marvel. But with a similar object Moses gave you circumcision. This seems best to suit the words and the context. He adds to His argument the comprehensive advice of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-24.htm" title="Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.">John 7:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">μὴ κρίνετε κατʼ ὄψιν</span> … <span class="greekheb">κρίνατε</span>. “Judge not according to appearance:” <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ὄψιν</span>, according to what presents itself to the eye; the Pharisaic vice. In appearance the healing of the impotent man was a breach of the Sabbath-law. No righteous judgment can be come to if appearances decide.
