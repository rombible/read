It is remarkable, that the guilty persons did not offer to make the least resistance; probably, a consciousness of guilt restrained them, or the wonderful things which Jesus had performed at this festival, though not recorded, with the influence of Christ’s miraculous power on their minds, made them afraid to resist him. Nevertheless, in the apprehension of the disciples, he exposed him self to great danger, by turning out a body of factious men, whom the priests and rulers supported. On this occasion, therefore, they called to mind, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-10.htm" title="When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.">Psalm 69:10</a>, <span class="ital">The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up </span>— Imputing their Master’s action to such a concern for the purity of God’s worship, as the psalmist of old was animated by. The truth is, it certainly was an evidence of a very extraordinary zeal indeed; a zeal nothing inferior to that for which the prophets were famed.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:12-22 The first public work in which we find Christ engaged, was driving from the temple the traders whom the covetous priests and rulers encouraged to make a market-place of its courts. Those now make God's house a house of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divine offices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gave a sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing. He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; I will permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his own power; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his own life. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, which the Scripture speaks by way of figure. When Jesus was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he has said this. It helps much in understanding the Divine word, to observe the fulfilling of the Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A scourge - A whip.<p>Of small cords - This whip was made as an emblem of authority, and also for the purpose of driving from the temple the cattle which had been brought there for sale.

But herein was the mighty power of God seen, that Christ, a single, private, obscure person, should without any more noise or opposition drive out the multitude of these hucksters, and overturn their tables. Nor I think (after the consideration of this circumstance) need we inquire by what authority he did this? It was prophesied of him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a></span>, that he should <span class="ital">come to his temple; </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-3.htm" title="And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer to the LORD an offering in righteousness.">Malachi 3:3</a></span>, should <span class="ital">sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; and purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver.</span> Christ here, according to that prophecy, cometh to his temple, and begins to purge it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when he had made a scourge of small cords,.... That is, Jesus, as the Persic version expresses it. This scourge might be made either of thongs cut out of the hides of beasts slain in sacrifice; or of the cords, with which the owners of the cattle had brought them to this place; or with which they had fastened them in it. And it seems to be made, and used, not so much for force and terror, as to intimate, that these persons, the violators of the holy place, deserved the scourge of divine wrath and punishment; as well as to show the miraculous power of Christ in driving such a number of men before him, with so small and insignificant a weapon; for the phrase is diminutive. The reason given by Dr. Lightfoot, and others, why Christ made use of a whip, or scourge, rather than a staff, is, because it was contrary to a Jewish canon (d) to go into the mountain of the house, or temple, with a staff in the hand; and yet the man of the mountain of the house, or the master of it, who used to go about every ward with torches burning before him, if he found a Levite asleep in his ward (e), struck him  with his staff, and had power to burn his clothes. <p>He drove them all out of the temple; that is, he drove out "the men", as the Persic version reads; the merchants, the sellers of oxen, sheep, and doves, and the money changers: "and the sheep, and the oxen" likewise; the Persic version adds, "doves"; but these are after mentioned: <p>and poured out the changers money; off of the tables, or out of the boxes, or dishes, or drawers, or purses, in which it was put: <p>and overthrew the tables; at which they sat, and on which they told their money. <p>(d) Misn.

The men probably fled at once. The order is natural; first the driving out of the cattle, then the pouring out of the money and overturning the tables. The word for ‘money’ literally means ‘something cut up small,’ hence ‘change.’ The common exchange would be foreign money for Jewish, payments to the Temple being necessarily made in Jewish coin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-15.htm" title="And when he had made a whip of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;">John 2:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Φραγέλλιον</span>, <span class="ital">a scourge</span>) Admirable zeal!—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ σχοινίων</span>) <span class="ital">of</span> several <span class="ital">cords</span>: for so scourges were formerly made.

This feature of the Lord's action was not repeated at the close of the ministry. Observe that John singles out this punitive element in the first public appearance of the Lord for especial notice, and adds it to the otherwise resistless force which he was accustomed to wield by the glance of his eye or the tones of his voice. The "scourge," as Godet says, is a symbol, not an instrument. It was in Christ's hands a conspicuous method of expressing his indignation, and augmenting the force of his command, by an indication that he meant to be obeyed there and then. <span class="cmt_word">He drove them all out of the temple court</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, the intrusive sellers of the sacrificial beasts, the herdsmen, and traffickers. <span class="cmt_word">Also</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the sheep and the oxen,</span> which moved at once in a vast group, turning, fleeing to the great exits; and <span class="cmt_word">he poured out</span> on the ground, and with his own hand, <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">coins</span> <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the exchangers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), and overthrew the tables. "Christ had," as Hengstenberg says, "a powerful confederate in the consciences of the offenders." The presentiment of coming revolution and overthrow aided the impression produced by that majestic countenance and commanding glance, manner, and voice, that so often made men feel that they were utterly and absolutely in his power (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-6.htm">John 18:6</a>, note). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A scourge (&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here in the New Testament.
