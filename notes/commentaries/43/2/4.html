The former have found in each clause of the sentence a condemnation of Mariolatry; the latter have sought explanations not inconsistent with their faith and practice. It may be hoped that the day is now past, when anything other than thoughts of reverence and honour is to be connected with the title “Woman,” least of all in the words of One who claimed as His own highest dignity Sonship of, identity with, humanity; and who was here addressing the mother to whom He had been subject, and from whom His own humanity had been derived. Were proof needed of the tenderness which underlies the word as used by Him, it would be found in the other instances which the Gospels supply. . It is spoken only to the Syro-Phœnician whose faith is great (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-28.htm" title="Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith: be it to you even as you will. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.">Matthew 15:28</a>); to the daughter of Abraham loosed from her infirmity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-12.htm" title="And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said to her, Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity.">Luke 13:12</a>); and, in this Gospel, to the Samaritan embracing the higher faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21</a>); perhaps to the sinner whom He does not condemn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-10.htm" title="When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those your accusers? has no man condemned you?">John 8:10</a>); to the same mother from the cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!">John 19:26</a>); and to Mary Magdalene in tears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-13.htm" title="And they say to her, Woman, why weep you? She said to them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.">John 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-15.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have borne him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.">John 20:15</a>).<p>Still the second part of the sentence declares beyond all doubt that the two regarded His life-work from stand-points so different that there is nothing common between them. It is literally, <span class= "ital">What is that to me and to thee?</span> The parallels for the form of the question are <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-24.htm" title="And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with the LORD God of Israel?">Joshua 22:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-12.htm" title="And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?">Judges 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-10.htm" title="And the king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD has said to him, Curse David.

The real parallel is in this Gospel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.">John 7:6</a>. Mother and brethren alike regarded life in its events; for Him it is an unchanging principle. For them, action is determined by the outer stimulus; for Him, by the eternal will of the Father. Their hour is always ready; His is the development of a law. His answer is another form of that question kept in her heart: “Wist ye not that I must be about My Father’s business?” but “they understood not the saying which He spake unto them” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-49.htm" title="And he said to them, How is it that you sought me? knew you not that I must be about my Father's business?">Luke 2:49</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Mine hour is not yet come</span>—i.e., the hour for My being openly manifested as the Messiah.

Those that would have Christ with them at their marriage, must invite him by prayer, and he will come. While in this world we sometimes find ourselves in straits, even when we think ourselves in fulness. There was want at a marriage feast. Those who are come to care for the things of the world, must look for trouble, and count upon disappointment. In our addresses to Christ, we must humbly spread our case before him, and then refer ourselves to him to do as he pleases. In Christ's reply to his mother there was no disrespect. He used the same word when speaking to her with affection from the cross; yet it is a standing testimony against the idolatry of after-ages, in giving undue honours to his mother. His hour is come when we know not what to do. Delays of mercy are not denials of prayer. Those that expect Christ's favours, must observe his orders with ready obedience. The way of duty is the way to mercy; and Christ's methods must not be objected against. The beginning of Moses' miracles was turning water into blood, Ex 7:20; the beginning of Christ's miracles was turning water into wine; which may remind us of the difference between the law of Moses and the gospel of Christ. He showed that he improves creature-comforts to all true believers, and make them comforts indeed. And Christ's works are all for use. Has he turned thy water into wine, given thee knowledge and grace? it is to profit withal; therefore draw out now, and use it. It was the best wine. Christ's works commend themselves even to those who know not their Author. What was produced by miracles, always was the best in its kind. Though Christ hereby allows a right use of wine, he does not in the least do away his own caution, which is, that our hearts be not at any time overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, Lu 21:34. Though we need not scruple to feast with our friends on proper occasions, yet every social interview should be so conducted, that we might invite the Redeemer to join with us, if he were now on earth; and all levity, luxury, and excess offend him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Woman - This term, as used here, seems to imply reproof, as if she was interfering in that which did not properly concern her; but it is evident that no such reproof or disrespect was intended by the use of the term "woman" instead of "mother." It is the same term by which he tenderly addressed Mary Magdalene after his resurrection <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-15.htm">John 20:15</a>, and his mother when he was on the cross, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26</a>.

This expression is sometimes used to denote indignation or contempt. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-12.htm">Judges 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-10.htm">2 Samuel 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-18.htm">1 Kings 17:18</a>. But it is not probable that it denoted either in this place; if it did, it was a mild reproof of Mary for attempting to control or direct him in his power of working miracles. Most of the ancients supposed this to be the intention of Jesus. The words sound to us harsh, but they might have been spoken in a tender manner, and not have been intended as a reproof. It is clear that he did not intend to refuse to provide wine, but only to delay it a little; and the design was, therefore, to compose the anxiety of Mary, and to prevent her being solicitous about it. It may, then, be thus expressed: "My mother, be not anxious. To you and to me this should not be a matter of solicitude. The proper time of my interfering has not yet come. When that is come I will furnish a supply, and in the meantime neither you nor I should be solicitous." Thus understood, it is so far from being a "harsh reproof," that it was a mild exhortation for her to dismiss her fears and to put proper trust in him.<p>Mine hour ... - My time. The proper time for my interposing. Perhaps the wine was not yet entirely exhausted. The wine had begun to fail, but he would not work a miracle until it was entirely gone, that the miracle might be free-from all possibility of suspicion. It does not mean that the proper time for his working a miracle, or entering. on his public work had not come, but that the proper time for his interposing there had not arrived. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.

Calling her "woman", as it was no ways contrary to her being a virgin, <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, so it was no mark of disrespect; it being an usual way of speaking with the Jews, when they showed the greatest respect to the person spoken to; and was used by our Lord when he addressed his mother with the greatest tenderness, and strongest affection, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26</a>. The Jews frequently object this passage to us Christians: one of their writers his objection in this manner (p): <p>"they (the Christians) say, the mother of Jesus is never called a woman their law; but here her son himself calls her a man.'' <p>Another puts it thus (q): <p>"it is their (the Christians) belief, that Mary, even after she brought forth Jesus, was a virgin; but if she was, as they say, why does not her son call her by the name of virgin? but he calls her a woman, which signifies one known by man, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>.'' <p>To which may be replied, that the mother of Jesus is never called a woman in the New Testament, is not said by us Christians: it is certain she is so called, both here, and elsewhere; but then this is no contradiction to her being a virgin; one, and the same person, may be a virgin, and a woman: the Abraham's servant was sent to take for wife for his son Isaac, is called a woman, though a virgin that had never known any man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-5.htm">Genesis 24:5</a>. Besides, we do not think ourselves obliged to maintain the perpetual virginity of Mary, the mother of our Lord; it is enough that she was a virgin when she conceived, and when she brought forth her firstborn: and as the Jews endeavour to take an advantage of this against the character of Mary, the Papists are very solicitous about the manner in which these words are said, lest they should be thought to contain a reproof, which they cannot bear she should be judged worthy of; or suggest any thing to her dishonour, whom they magnify as equal to her son: but certain it is, that the following words, <p>what have I to do with thee? show resentment and reproof. Some render the words, "what is it to thee and me?" and give this as the sense; what concern is this of ours? what business have we with it? let them look to it, who are the principal in the feast, and have the management of it. The Jew (r) objects to this sense of the words, but gives a very weak reason for it: <p>"but I say, (says he,) who should be concerned but the master of the feast? and he was the master of the feast:'' <p>whereas it is a clear case that he was one of the guests, one that was invited, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-2.htm">John 2:2</a>, and that there was a governor or ruler of the feast, who might be more properly called the master of it than Jesus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-8.htm">John 2:8</a>. However, since Christ afterwards did concern himself in it, it looks as if this was not his meaning. Others render it to the sense we do, "what have I with thee?" as the Ethiopic version; or "what business hast thou with me?" as the Persic version; and is the same with,  , "what have I to do with thee?" used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-18.htm">1 Kings 17:18</a>, where the Septuagint use the same phrase as here; and such a way of speaking is common with Jewish writers (s): hereby signifying, that though, as man, and a son of hers, he had been subject to her, in which he had set an example of obedience to parents; yet, as God, he had a Father in heaven, whose business he came to do; and in that, and in his office, as Mediator, she had nothing to do with him; nor was he to be directed by her in that work; or to be told, or the least hint given when a miracle should be wrought, by him in confirmation of his mission and doctrine. Moreover, he adds, <p>mine hour is not yet come: meaning not the hour of his sufferings and death, in which sense he sometimes uses this phrase; as if the hint was, that it was not proper for him to work miracles as yet, lest it should provoke his enemies to seek his life before his time; but rather the time of his public ministry and miracles, which were to go together, and the one to be a proof of the other; though it seems to have a particular regard to the following miracle, the time of doing that was not yet come; the proper juncture, when all fit circumstances meeting together, it would be both the more useful, and the more illustrious: or his meaning is, that his time of doing miracles in public was not yet; and therefore, though he was willing to do this miracle, yet he chose to do it in the most private manner; so that only a few, and not the principal persons at the feast should know it: wherefore the reproof was not so much on the account of the motion itself, as the unseasonableness of it; and so his mother took it. <p>(p) Vet.

Jesus, conscious of His close communion with the Father, sees clearly that this His first manifestation of Himself as Messiah in the working of miracles stands, even with reference to the time when it is to begin, in close connection with the divine appointment; and He feels that the moment (<span class="greekheb">ἡ ὥρα</span> = <span class="greekheb">ὁ καιρός</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-21.htm" title="A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.">John 16:21</a>, and often in the N. T. and the classics) for this first Messianio display of power is not yet present when His mother refers to the want of wine. <span class="ital">How</span> He was conscious of the exact <span class="ital">horas et moras</span> for working, cannot be more precisely determined. Euthymius Zigabenus is substantially right: <span class="greekheb">ἡ τοῦ θαυματουργῆσαι</span>; and Ewald: “the hour of full Messianic sense of power.” Strangely attributing to Mary thoughts of that kind, Baumgarten Crusius remarks, “the moment of my <span class="ital">public appearance</span> as Messiah;” and Godet: “l’heure de l’avénement <span class="ital">royal</span>.” Anticipating <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>, Lücke, Tholuck, Brückner, Maier, Baur, Baumgarten render: “the moment of the <span class="ital">revelation of my glory</span>.” Comp. Luthardt: “This miracle, as the figurative <span class="ital">prolepsis</span> of Christ’s subsequent full revelation of Himself before the eyes of men, was of significance only for that narrow circle, and was intended to lead Jesus on from it into public life,”—of which, however, the text contains no hint either in John 2 :or elsewhere.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[135] It is an error to suppose that <span class="greekheb">ἡ ὥρα μου</span> in John always signifies <span class="ital">the hour of Christ’s death</span>. Its reference depends entirely upon the <span class="ital">context</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-30.htm" title="Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.">John 7:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-20.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.">John 8:20</a>, where it means the hour of Christ’s seizure; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.">John 13:1</a>, where the more precise definition is expressly given. Already <span class="greekheb">τινὲς</span> in Chrysostom, Ebrard, and many, take it here as meaning the hour of Christ’s death. Hilgenfeld understands it of the hour of the <span class="ital">glorification</span> of Jesus, the culminating point of which was certainly the crucifixion; and that Jesus, according to John, gives expression to the full consciousness of the Logos, and its superhuman independence of all human counsel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-4.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you? my hour is not yet come.">John 2:4</a>. His complete reply is, <span class="greekheb">τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί</span>, <span class="greekheb">γύναι</span>; <span class="greekheb">οὔπω ἥκει ἡ ὥρα μου</span>. <span class="greekheb">γύναι</span> is a term of respect, not equivalent to our “woman”. See chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!">John 19:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-13.htm" title="And they say to her, Woman, why weep you? She said to them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.">John 20:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-12.htm" title="And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said to her, Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity.">Luke 13:12</a>. In the Greek tragedians it is constantly used in addressing queens and persons of distinction. Augustus addresses Cleopatra as <span class="greekheb">γύναι</span> (Dio, quoted by Wetstein). Calvin goes too far when he says that this term of address was used to correct the superstitious adoration of the Virgin which was to arise. But while there is neither harshness nor disrespect, there is distance in the expression. Wetstein hits the point when he says: “Non poterat dicere: quid mihi tecum est, mater?”—<span class="greekheb">τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί</span> represents the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">מַה־לִּי וָלָךְ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-12.htm" title="And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?">Jdg 11:12</a>), and means: What have we in common? Trench gives the sense: “Let me alone; what is there common to thee and me; we stand in this matter on altogether different grounds”. Or, as Holtzmann gives it, Our point of view an interests are wholly diverse; why do you mingle them?—<span class="greekheb">οὔπω ἥκει ἡ ὥρα μου</span>. not as Bengel, “discedendi hora,” but, mine hour for bringing relief. This implies that He too had observed the failure of the wine and was waiting a fitting opportunity to interfere. That the same formula is more than once used by Jesus of His death (see chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-30.htm" title="Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.">John 7:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-20.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.">John 8:20</a>) merely indicates that it could be used of any critical time. Euthymius says it here means “the hour of miracle working”. Wetstein quotes from R. Sira “non quavis hora fit miraculum”. Especially true is this of the first miracle-of the Messiah, which would commit Him to a life of publicity ending in an ignominious death. That Mary found hope in the <span class="greekheb">οὔπω</span> is obvious from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-5.htm" title="His mother said to the servants, Whatever he said to you, do it.">John 2:5</a>. She did not find His reply wholly refusal. She therefore says to the servants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-5.htm" title="His mother said to the servants, Whatever he said to you, do it.">John 2:5</a>), <span class="greekheb">ὅ τι ἂν λέγῃ ὑμῖν ποιήσατε</span>. The <span class="greekheb">διακόνοι</span>, or servants waiting at table, might not otherwise have obeyed an unimportant guest. His orders might perhaps be of an unusual kind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">Woman, what have I to do with thee?</span>] S. John alone of all the Evangelists never gives the Virgin’s name. Here, as so often, he assumes that his readers know the main points in the Gospel narrative: or it may be part of the reserve which he exhibits with regard to all that nearly concerns himself. Christ’s Mother had become his mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!...">John 19:26-27</a>). He nowhere mentions his brother James.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Treatises have been written to shew that these words do not contain a rebuke; for if Christ here rebukes His Mother, it cannot be maintained that she is immaculate. ‘Woman’ of course implies no rebuke; the Greek might more fairly be rendered ‘Lady’ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!">John 19:26</a>), At the same time it marks a difference between the Divine Son and the earthly parent: He does not say, ‘Mother.’ But ‘what have I to do with thee?’ <span class="ital">does</span> imply rebuke, as is evident from the other passages where the phrase occurs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-12.htm" title="And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?">Jdg 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-18.htm" title="And she said to Elijah, What have I to do with you, O you man of God? are you come to me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?">1 Kings 17:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-13.htm" title="And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.

I beseech you, torment me not.">Luke 8:28</a>. Only in one passage does the meaning seem to vary: in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-21.htm" title="But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you this day, but against the house with which I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear you from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy you not.">2 Chronicles 35:21</a> the question seems to mean ‘why need we quarrel?’ rather than ‘what have we in common?’ But such a meaning, if possible there, would be quite inappropriate here. The further question has been asked,—what was she rebuked <span class="ital">for?</span> Chrysostom thinks for vanity; she wished to glorify herself through her Son. More probably for interference: He will help, but in His own way, and in His own time. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-51.htm" title="And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.">Luke 2:51</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">mine hour</span>] The meaning of ‘My hour’ and ‘His hour’ in this Gospel depends in each case on the context. There cannot here be any reference to His death; rather it means His hour for ‘manifesting forth His glory’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a></span>) as the Messiah by working miracles.

Maldonatus admits that Catholics "in varias tamen de sensu hujus loci sententias distracti sunt"). But the proverbial <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>; wheresoever the words occur, imply, if net personal estrangement, yet as to the matter in hand some divergence of feeling (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-28.htm">Luke 8:28</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-10.htm">2 Samuel 16:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-18.htm">1 Kings 17:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a>). Almost all commentators seem to suggest that our Lord refused to be guided by a mother's direction; that he wished her to understand that he was breaking off from her control and from that silent submission which he had hitherto willingly yielded (so Meyer, Hengstenberg, Godet, Westcott, Tholuck, Ebrard, and Lange). Schaff has quoted from the Fathers before the Nestorian controversy dear proof that they admitted censure, and therefore blame, in the blessed Virgin Mary. Still, it seems to me that the cause of the censure, coupled with an immediate response to her special request about the wine, has not been sufficiently appreciated, he said, "Mine hour is not yet come." It would have come if the provision of wine was the ground of divergence of sentiment; if the moment for the supply of these temporal wants were the point of difference between them. The "hour" for Christ to tell the world all that Mary knew had <span class="accented">not</span> come. The hour of the full revelation of his Messianic claims had not come, nor did it come in the temple, or by the lake, or in the feast day; not till the awful moment of rejection, when death was hovering over him, and the blow was about to fall, did he say, "The hour has come" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-23.htm">John 12:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a>) - the hour of his greatest glory. "The hour had not yet come." The hour would come when rivers of living water would be supplied to all those who come to him; when the blood he would shed would be a Divine stream, clear as crystal, for the refreshment of all nations; when at another marriage supper of a saved humanity the precious blood should be an ample supply of costly wine for all the world. Moreover, the link at the present moment between our Lord and his mother must begin to shade into something more spiritual. It was not possible that he should be holden by it. A sword would pierce through her maternal heart when she became gradually alive to the fact that they that do the will of his Father, the same were his "brothers, sisters, and mother." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Woman<p>Implying no severity nor disrespect.
