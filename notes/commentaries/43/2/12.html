Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-13.htm" title="And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:">Matthew 4:13</a>. It was on the shore of the lake of Tiberias, and He must have gone “down” to it from any locality among the hills of Galilee. The words do not imply that they went to Capernaum direct from Cana. The “after this” allows of a return to Nazareth, and the mention of the “brethren” makes such a return probable. The place of this sojourn in the order of events belongs to the narrative of the earlier Gospels, and here, as elsewhere, questions which recur are treated when they are first mentioned. To deal with them on each occurrence would be to save the trouble of reference at the cost of much space; and this would be ill-saved; the spiritual profit arising from constant reference is one which no earnest student of the Gospels could desire to lose. He will wish to study every event in that life in every word which records it.

See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-13.htm" title="And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelled in Capernaum, which is on the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:">Matthew 4:13</a>. Here Christ and his disciples continued but a short time, the passover of the Jews being at hand, which Jesus, who was made under the law, and maintained a religious regard to its ceremonial, as well as its moral precepts, would not neglect attending: thus teaching us by his example a strict observance of all divine institutions, and a diligent attendance on religious assemblies. As the evangelists have not informed us how many passovers happened between the baptism and death of Christ, or during the course of his public ministry, learned men have been much divided in their opinions on the subject. But by far the greater part have supposed there were four, reckoning this the first; the feast mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-1.htm" title="After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 5:1</a>, the second; the passover spoken of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>, as the third; and that at which Christ suffered, the fourth. But there are others of a different opinion. The celebrated Sir Isaac Newton reckons five; the first, this which is now before us; the second, according to him, happened four months after Christ’s discourse with the woman of Samaria, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a>; the third, a few days before the story of the <span class="ital">disciples rubbing the ears of corn, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.">Luke 6:1</a>; the fourth, a little after the feeding of the five thousand; and the last, at the time of our Lord’s crucifixion.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:12-22 The first public work in which we find Christ engaged, was driving from the temple the traders whom the covetous priests and rulers encouraged to make a market-place of its courts. Those now make God's house a house of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divine offices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gave a sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing. He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; I will permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his own power; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his own life. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, which the Scripture speaks by way of figure. When Jesus was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he has said this. It helps much in understanding the Divine word, to observe the fulfilling of the Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To Capernaum - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13</a>.<p>Not many days - The reason why he remained there no longer was that the Passover was near, and they went up to Jerusalem to attend it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

This new section runs to the end of the fourth chapter, and gives an account of the first great series of public manifestations on the part of Christ (1) in Jerusalem, (2) in Judaea, (3) in Samaria, (4) in Galilee. These are introduced by the note of time, <span class="greekheb">μετὰ τοῦτο</span>, commonly used by John when he wishes merely to denote sequence without definitely marking the length of the interval. The interval in the present case was probably long enough at any rate to allow of the Nazareth family returning home, although this is not in the text. The motive for a fresh movement was probably the desire of the fishermen to return home. Accordingly <span class="greekheb">κατέβη εἰς Καφαρναοὺμ</span>, down from the higher lands about Nazareth to the lake side, 680 feet below sea level. His destination was <span class="greekheb">Καφαρναούμ</span>, the site of which is probably to be found at Khan Minyeh (Minia), at the north end of the plain of Gennesareth, where the great road to Damascus leaves the lake side and strikes north. [The most valuable comparison of the two competing sites, <span class="ital">Tell Hum</span> and <span class="ital">Khan Minyeh</span>, will be found in the <span class="ital">Rob Roy on the Jordan</span>. Mr. Macgregor spent several days sounding along the shore, measuring distances, comparing notes, and making careful examination, and concluded in favour of Khan Minyeh. Tell Hum was thought to represent Kefr Nahum (Nahumston); which, when it ceased to be a town and became a heap of ruins, might have been called Tell Nahum, and hence Tell Hum. Authoritative opinion is, however, decidedly in favour of Khan Minyeh.] With Jesus there went to Capernaum <span class="greekheb">ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>. From the manner in which His brothers are here mentioned along with His mother the natural inference is that they were of the same father and probably of the same mother. At Capernaum no long stay was made, the reason being given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 2:13</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐγγὺς ἦν τὸ πάσχα τῶν Ἰουδαίων</span>, the Passover was approaching, here called “of the Jews,” either for the sake of Gentile readers or because the Christian Easter was sometimes called <span class="greekheb">πάσχα</span>, and John wished to distinguish it.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀνέβη</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὁ Ἰησοῦς</span>, the disciples also went, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-17.htm" title="And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of your house has eaten me up.">John 2:17</a>. “Went <span class="ital">up</span>” because Jerusalem was the capital, and because of its height (2500 feet) above sea level. On these movements Prof. Sanday (<span class="ital">Fourth Gospel</span>, p. 53) makes the remark: “If it is all an artificial composition with a dogmatic object, why should the author carry his readers thus to Capernaum—for nothing? The apparent aimlessness of this statement seems to show that it came directly from a fresh and vivid recollection and not from any floating tradition.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. “Now follows a section of which <span class="bld">we</span> can only say with M. Renan, that it constitutes a decisive triumph for our Gospel.… If it is at all an artificial composition, with a dogmatic object, why should the author carry his readers thus to Capernaum—for nothing?” S. p. 52. If S. John wrote it, all is simple and natural. He records this visit to Capernaum because it actually took place, <span class="bld">and</span> because he well remembers those ‘not many days.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">went down</span>] Capernaum (the modern Tell-Hûm) being on the shore of the lake.

On the vexed question of the ‘brethren of the Lord’ see the <span class="ital">Introduction</span> to the <span class="ital">Epistle of S. James</span>. It is impossible to determine with certainty whether they are (1) the children of Joseph and Mary, born after the birth of Jesus; (2) the children of Joseph by a former marriage, whether levirate or not; or (3) adopted children. There is nothing in Scripture to warn us against (1), the most natural view antecedently; but it has against it the general consensus of the Fathers, and the prevailing tradition of the perpetual virginity of S. Mary. Jerome’s theory, that they were our Lord’s cousins, sons of Alphaeus, is the one most commonly adopted, but <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-5.htm" title="For neither did his brothers believe in him.">John 7:5</a> (see note there) is fatal to it, and it labours under other difficulties as well.

Three competing sites for this small town have been advocated by Eastern travellers; all of them on the shore of the lake, all near to Bethsaida and Chorazin, in "the way of the sea," combining more or less the characteristics required by the New Testament narrative and the references in Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 3:10, 8). Keim is in favour of <span class="accented">Khan, Minyeh</span>; but there is no abundant spring such as Josephus describes, nor are there any ruins which indicate an extensive town. Caspari has argued in favour of <span class="accented">Ain Mudawarah</span>, a mile and a half to the west of <span class="accented">Khan Minyeh</span>, in which, though water is abundant, there are no remains of buildings. The old travellers, and the most recent explorations, have coincided in fixing on <span class="accented">Tell-Hum</span> as the site; and Dr. Farrar, Dr. Westcott, Major Wilson, incline to this conclusion. Abundant ruins are found there, and, what is more than probable,  the remains of the very synagogue built by the Roman centurion, and one certainly dating back to the Herodian age. <span class="accented">Tell-Hum</span>, or "the Mound of Hum," is an easy corruption of the <span class="accented">Caphar</span>, or village of <span class="accented">Nahum. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples.</span> They may have returned home to Nazareth, though some recent commentators suggest that Cana had become the home of his family in late years. This is contradicted by the express statement of ch. 1:45, and the utter obliteration of the name of Cana from the synoptic narrative. We cannot identify this possible return to Nazareth with the account in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-20</a>, because it assumes a previous period of activity in Capernaum, and further, because the commencement of Christ's public ministry is expressly made synchronous with the imprisonment of the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-15</a>), which did not take place till weeks or months afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-24.htm">John 3:24</a>). Consequently, this journey to Capernaum preceded the journey to Jerusalem and the return to Nazareth, of which Matthew speaks. The fact that "the mother and brethren "of Jesus accompanied him, but not "the sisters," suggests what is implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a> that the sisters were married in Nazareth and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm">Mark 3:21-23</a> that they did not accompany the non-believing brothers in their endeavour "to lay hold of him." The fact that Joseph is not mentioned induces the common assumption that he was already dead. Volumes have been written on "the brethren of Jesus." The determination of their parentage is one of the most perplexing points in the evangelic history. There are three hypotheses, which are alike beset with difficulties. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The view propounded by Helvidius in Rome, in the fourth century, and to which Jerome replied, that the "brothers" are brothers in the ordinary sense, children of Joseph and Mary. This supposition is sustained by the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>, each of which implies that the mother of our Lord had other children. The sentiment of the Church in favour of Mary's perpetual virginity, and in favour of the uniqueness of her maternity, has powerfully contested this supposition. Further, apart from any sentiment, it has been said that the Lord would not have commended the mother to the beloved disciple, if he had living brothers who had a previous claim. To this, however, it is replied that John, the son of Zebedee and Salome, may have been his near relative, if Salome were the sister of the Virgin; and also that, up to the time of the Ascension, there is no proof that the brethren believed in him, but the contrary. The effect of a special manifestation to James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>.) may have led to a general admission of the brethren, who are distinguished from, but yet <span class="accented">with</span>, the eleven apostles and the mother on the eve of the Ascension (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> To obviate the difficulties of a sentimental kind, it was suggested by Jerome, and it has been often assumed since, that these brothers were in reality <span class="accented">first cousins</span>, not the children of Salome the sister of the Virgin, but of Mary the wife of Cleophas, who is supposed to be the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus (see ch. 20:25, note), and further that this Cleophas   =   Clopas   =   <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>   =   Alphaeus   =   Chalphai for the Aramaic guttural might be omitted as in Alphseus, or turned into <span class="greek">&#x3ba;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c7;</span> in <span class="accented">Clopas</span>, found in John's text. Jerome, however (Lightfoot), never referred to this confirmation of his theory; but it has been hence conjectured that James the son of Alphaeus was identical with the celebrated "James the brother of our Lord," mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-17.htm">Acts 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9, 12</a>; and in ecclesiastical history. If, however, this James were the "son of Alphaeus," then <span class="accented">Judas</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-22.htm">John 14:22</a>) (not Iscariot) - "Judas of James" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>; <span class="accented">Acts</span> 1:13) - was also one of the "brethren;" also Joses and Simon, sons of Cleophas, were of their number; and some have gone further, and made Simon the Canaanite the other brother. This might possibly be the solution of the puzzle, if the entire theory did not break down under the clear distinction drawn in evangelic narrative between the twelve apostles and the brethren. <span class="accented">E.g.</span> in this passage they are discriminated from "disciples." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a> the "brethren" are said not to believe on the Lord. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a> they are mentioned in addition to the apostles. Though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1.htm">Galatians 1</a> and 2, James might seem from his great eminence to be classed with apostles in some wider sense, yet in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a> he seems to take precedence of <span class="accented">all the</span> apostles, at the Council of Jerusalem, and in presidency of the Church there. Moreover, the identification of Cleophas with Alphaeus is very doubtful. Clopas is Aramaic, Cleophas a Greek name; and the identification of his wife Mary with the sister of the Virgin is also very doubtful; while to have two sisters of the same name in the same family is highly improbable. We cannot believe, further, that so distinguished a man as James the brother of our Lord could have been designated as "James the  Less" in the evangelic narrative (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>). If the "cousin theory" holds, this must have been the case. Finally, "cousins" would hardly so persistently have been spoken of as <span class="accented">brothers</span>, and this would be still less likely if their mother was living. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The third hypothesis, which is the suggestion of Epiphanius, is that these brothers were the children of Joseph by a previous marriage, to whom the blessed Virgin had acted the part of mother. This is based on a legend of the apocryphal 'Protevang. of James' (ch. 9. and 17.), where Joseph speaks of his "sons." The theory saves the virginity of Mary, but sacrifices that of Joseph. Such a conclusion, in some ecclesiastic circles, is almost as unwelcome as the former. Against Jerome's hypothesis the greatest number of difficulties present themselves, and it must be abandoned. Therefore the choice really lies between that of Helvidius <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> and that of Epiphauius <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span>. These are alike encumbered by the perplexity that among the twelve apostles there were two Jameses, two Judases, and two Simons; and among the "brethren" there must have been also a James, Judas, Joses, and Simon, with sisters. Moreover, there was a Joses or Joseph, who was son of Alphseus, and therefore a brother of James. This is not an insuperable difficulty, because of the frequency with which personal names recur in Oriental families. Whether this multiplicity be true or not, there are, at least, ten <span class="accented">other</span> Simons in the New Testament, and nearly as many Josephs or Joses; and Judas Barsabas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22</a>) must be discriminated from the two Judases here supposed. We must, however, choose between suppositions <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span>. On the one side, it is said, if the brethren of Jesus were not the own sons of Mary, the language of Jesus on the cross would be entirely explicable. This is true; but, on the other side, if <span class="accented">John</span> were indeed a blood relation and beloved disciple (even if James was so also, but did not believe on him), the difficulty of the language is reduced to a minimum. There is no scriptural authority for the Epiphanian theory, but it is made plausible by the 'Gospel according to St. Peter' and the ' Protevang. Jacobi,' which refer to Joseph's sons. The whole history of its reception in the Church may be seen in the masterly essay of Bishop Lightfoot. The view of Alford, Mill, Farrar, Coder, and many others is in favour of a plain common sense interpretation of the letter of Scripture. Christ, who honoured marriage by his first display of miraculous power, and this at the suggestion of his own mother, and in the society of those who passed undoubtedly as his brothers, would not feel that the faintest shadow of a shade fell on the lofty purity of his mother by this hypothesis. Certainly the Evangelist Matthew had not a vestige in him of that adoration of virginity, or Mariolatry, which has led ecclesiastical historians and commentators to reject the Helvidian hypothesis. Godet and some other harmonists endeavour to find, during the residence in Capernaum, the occasion for the first miraculous draught of fishes, and the final call of the two pairs of brothers; but it is. excluded by the notes of time subsequently given. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-22.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The second sign Supremacy over the theocratic house. Illustrations of righteousness, reverence, power, and sacrificial ministry.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - They abode there not many days. And the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. The narrative at ver. 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1, 27</a>, etc., shows, that some disciples were with him; but there is no reason for believing that the whole group were there. The fact is important that Jesus personally is said (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>) to have gone up to Jerusalem, and that no reference is made to his disciples, mother, or brethren doing so. This undoubtedly assumes that he was not attended by any compact group of followers. It is more than probable that Simon and James, if not Nathanael and Philip, remained in Galilee to receive their final call in due season. One cannot doubt that John and Andrew were his auditors and witnesses. He went up to utter his prophetic summons to the metropolis of the nation, to take his place in the palace temple of his Father, in the centre of the old theocracy. After showing his perfect human sympathy, his power over physical nature, his abounding resources, and the glory of his love, he resolved that there should be no misunderstanding of his moral mission, and proceeded to institute a public demonstration of his loyalty to the theocracy, to the temple, and to its worship. Just at the moment when the One who, greater than the temple, was about to display his unique claims to a service which would outlive all the pomp of temple worship, it was profoundly significant that he should demand from it a right presentation, and not a corrupt defilement, of its true significance. Modern criticism refuses to accept the statements of the synoptists and of John as alike true, and endeavours to explain away one or the ether account. We are content to say here that a repetition of the Christ's claim to sanctify the temple was again made on the eve of that awful day when that blood should be shed which would exhaust all the significance of the hecatombs of victims slain in its precincts, and when the veil of the temple should be rent in twain. Weiss here shows that Baur and Hilgenfeld are inconsistent in repudiating the historical character  of an early conflict of Jesus with the authorities at Jerusalem, and that they forget, in their eagerness to demonstrate the anti-Jewish character of the Johannine Christ, that he here is represented as a pious Jew, attending the national festivals and jealous for the honour of the temple. The chronological difficulties that arise if the two cleansings are identified amount to the grossest inaccuracy on the part either of the synoptists or John. Lucke, De Wette, Ewald, treat the synoptists as inaccurate, and John's account, being that of an eyewitness, as the reduction of the event to its proper place in the history. It is obvious that the synoptists (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-58.htm">Mark 14:58</a>) knew that words which John recounts had, at an earlier period, made a deep impression upon the multitude. The thief on the cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-38.htm">Matthew 27:38-44</a>), and the insulting crowds <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-27.htm">Mark 15:27-29</a>), and Stephen afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>), reveal familiarity with an utterance which John alone recounts, but which had been misunderstood. An ingenious writer in the <span class="accented">National Review</span>, 1857 (Mr. R.H. Hutton, "Theological Essays"), believes, not only that the entire scene in the temple, but that Christ's claim to be the Head of the kingdom, the parables of "wicked husbandmen" and "two sons," and the reference to the "baptism of John," should all be transferred, together with the triumphal entry, to the period in which John has placed the first temple cleansing. He thinks that the reference to the "baptism of John" was more reasonable at that period than two years after the death of John, and that (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-11.htm">Matthew 21:11</a>) the reference to "Jesus of Nazareth" was more appropriate at the beginning than at the close of the ministry. But, on the other hand, the inscription on the cross, "Jesus of Nazareth," and the numerous references to the "baptism of John" at a much later date, quite refute this argument. There are those who strenuously assail the historicity of St. John's account, and plead for the greater accuracy of the synoptists (Strauss, Baur, Hilgenfeld, etc.). But, seeing that the synoptic tradition takes no notice of this <span class="accented">preliminary</span> ministry, in which our Lord gives specimens of all his powers and glory, no reason presents itself why they should have singled out one narrative and misplaced it. So long as John's Gospel is held to have a genuine historicity, his narrative cannot be suffered to be a romantic transposition to meet a preconceived idea of chronological development. The early foreshadowing of the Lord's death and resurrection, coupled with the reference to Ms being "lifted up" like the serpent of brass, and the cruel treatment received from the people at Nazareth and from scribes and Pharisees at Capernaum, are in living harmony with one another, and combine to refute the idyllic reproduction of the public ministry, which Renan and many others have attempted to fashion, by which the early life is represented as enacted in one blaze of sunshine, and that its close alone was shrouded in clouds and darkened by the Lord's reckless and suicidal rushing on his fate. We therefore conclude, with numerous critics, that there is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> no reason to believe that John misplaced the temple cleansing; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that he does not preclude the second act of the like kind recorded in the synoptists; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> while the synoptists imply occurrences which are detailed in John, but omitted in their narrative, yet the character of the proceeding differs on both occasions. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He went down (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;)<p>Capernaum being on the lake shore, and Nazareth and Cana on the higher ground. </body></html>
