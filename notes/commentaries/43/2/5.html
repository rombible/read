She still believes and expects. Her command to the servants confirms the opinion that the marriage is of some member of the family. This opinion has taken strange traditional forms; one being that here, too, the Evangelist casts a veil over an incident in his own life, and that he was himself the bridegroom; but that, guided by the miracle, he from that moment left all and followed Christ. The Prologue to St. John attributed to Jerome says that “John, wishing to marry, was called from the wedding by our Lord” (Trench <span class= "ital">On Miracles,</span> p. 98). See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-29.htm" title="And every one that has forsaken houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundred times, and shall inherit everlasting life.">Matthew 19:29</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-26.htm" title="If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.">Luke 14:26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-5.htm" title="His mother said to the servants, Whatever he said to you, do it.">John 2:5</a></span>. <span class="ital">His mother </span>— Either gathering from his answer, or from something he said to her which the evangelists have not recorded, that he would perform something extraordinary; <span class="ital">saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it </span>— Obey his orders immediately and exactly, for he may have reasons for them beyond what you imagine.

Those that would have Christ with them at their marriage, must invite him by prayer, and he will come. While in this world we sometimes find ourselves in straits, even when we think ourselves in fulness. There was want at a marriage feast. Those who are come to care for the things of the world, must look for trouble, and count upon disappointment. In our addresses to Christ, we must humbly spread our case before him, and then refer ourselves to him to do as he pleases. In Christ's reply to his mother there was no disrespect. He used the same word when speaking to her with affection from the cross; yet it is a standing testimony against the idolatry of after-ages, in giving undue honours to his mother. His hour is come when we know not what to do. Delays of mercy are not denials of prayer. Those that expect Christ's favours, must observe his orders with ready obedience. The way of duty is the way to mercy; and Christ's methods must not be objected against. The beginning of Moses' miracles was turning water into blood, Ex 7:20; the beginning of Christ's miracles was turning water into wine; which may remind us of the difference between the law of Moses and the gospel of Christ. He showed that he improves creature-comforts to all true believers, and make them comforts indeed. And Christ's works are all for use. Has he turned thy water into wine, given thee knowledge and grace? it is to profit withal; therefore draw out now, and use it. It was the best wine. Christ's works commend themselves even to those who know not their Author. What was produced by miracles, always was the best in its kind. Though Christ hereby allows a right use of wine, he does not in the least do away his own caution, which is, that our hearts be not at any time overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, Lu 21:34. Though we need not scruple to feast with our friends on proper occasions, yet every social interview should be so conducted, that we might invite the Redeemer to join with us, if he were now on earth; and all levity, luxury, and excess offend him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>His mother saith ... - It is evident from this verse that his mother did not understand what he had said as a harsh reproof and repulse, but as an indication of his willingness at the proper time to furnish wine. In all this transaction he evinced the appropriate feelings of a son toward a mother. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5.

She took the reproof in good part, and by the words he said, and the manner in which he spoke them, or by the looks he gave, and the gestures he might use, she hoped, and even believed, that the thing she moved for would be done; and therefore went immediately to the servants, and gave them the following instructions: <p>whatsoever he saith unto you, do it; punctually observe and obey his orders in every circumstance. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-5.htm" title="His mother said to the servants, Whatever he said to you, do it.">John 2:5</a>. The words of Jesus last spoken implied that He intended to help, though not immediately. Hence Mary’s direction to the servants, whose service she supposed Jesus would require (perhaps to go and fetch wine). Any allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-55.htm" title="And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he said to you, do.">Genesis 41:55</a> (Hengstenberg) is remote from the text.

The habits of Oriental life at the present day make it extremely probable that the disciples of Jesus were themselves taking the place of those who graciously waited upon the guests. If so, the language of Mary to them, and the special effect of the whole scene upon their minds, become marked and suggestive. Be that as it may, the mother of Jesus clearly understood by the gentle rebuke she received, that Christ, her Son, had read her heart, and was going in some way, not to gratify her darling wish, but at least to take her hint for the consolation of her young friends, and to attend to her suggestion. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</span> Though in some sense slighted or reproved, she exhibits the most entire confidence in her Son and Lord. She encourages the servants to do whatever he might command. More may have passed between them than is reported. The evangelist often suggests omitted details (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-28.htm">John 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-1.htm">John 3:1, 2</a>; and elsewhere). The faith of Mary was not depressed by the discovery that there were depths of character in her Son which she could not fathom. Obedience to Christ will always be our duty, even though we cannot penetrate the reasons of his command. An interesting illustration of Mary's words may be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-55.htm">Genesis 41:55</a>, where Pharaoh gives the like injunction to his servants concerning Joseph. Archdeacon Watkins records a curious tradition, mentioned by Jerome in his Prologue to the Gospel, that John was himself the bridegroom, but that, guided by the miracle, he left all and followed Christ (see Sears' 'Heart of Jesus,' Trench, 'Miracles,' p. 98). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Unto the servants (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-35.htm">Mark 9:35</a>. </body></html>
