These passages of those familiar Old Testament writings then came to men who had been slow of heart to see them, with the quickening power of a new life.

Those now make God's house a house of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divine offices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gave a sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing. He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; I will permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his own power; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his own life. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, which the Scripture speaks by way of figure.

The disciples did not understand it, but they treasured it up in their memory, and the event showed what was its true meaning. Many prophecies are obscure when spoken which are perfectly plain when the event takes place. We learn from this, also, the importance of treasuring up the truths of the Bible now, though we may not perfectly understand them. Hereafter they may be plain to us. It is therefore important that "children," should learn the truths of the sacred Scriptures. Treasured up in their memory, they may not be understood "now," but hereafter they may be clear to them. Every one engaged in teaching a Sunday school, therefore, may be imparting instruction which may be understood, and may impart comfort, long after the teacher has gone to eternity.<p>They believed - That is, "after" he rose from the dead.<p>The scripture - The Old Testament, which predicted his resurrection.

Mark (1) The act by which Christ signalized His first public appearance in the Temple. Taking "His fan in His hand, He purges His floor," not thoroughly indeed, but enough to foreshadow His last act towards that faithless people&#8212;to sweep them out of God's house. (2) The sign of His authority to do this is the announcement, at this first outset of His ministry, of that coming death by their hands, and resurrection by His own, which were to pave the way for their judicial ejection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Even Christ’s own disciples at the first rather admired than perfectly understood their Lord.

"A pseudo-John imagining, in the second century, this ignorance of the apostle in regard to a saying which he had invented himself, is 'criticism' dashing itself against moral impossibility." These quiet "asides" and reflections of the biographer on the mistaken ideas which he cites and corrects, are of consummate value, as pointing out the stages by which the most stupendous ideas that have taken human spirits captive dawned on the most susceptible minds. The "Word" and the "Scripture" helped the disciples to subsequent faith. Why is "Scripture" in the singular, seeing that John used this form of expression ten times when he had one definite passage of Scripture in his mind, and used the plural when the general authority of Scripture was appealed to? Many have looked to one or another definite Scripture text supposed to predict the resurrection of Christ, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> (some, very wrongly, to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>, where no reference can be established to this great event). Dr. Moulton points back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>, and the impression which the Lord's "zeal" had produced on the disciples. It seems better to recall Christ's own words, and the comment of Luke, in Luke 24:25-27, where the whole Scripture seems to have been laid under contribution to establish the grand expectation. Further, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-9.htm">John 20:9</a>, where John, referring to the same subject, uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> in the singular, for the general tendency of Scripture. All the passages which couple suffering and apparent defeat with triumph and victory, did prepare the mind of thoughtful men for the better understanding of the Resurrection. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. and the closing words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a> thereupon come into view; and, in fact, all the Scriptures which anticipate the glorious reign and victory of the Christ and the extension of his kingdom, when coupled with those which portrayed the sorrows of Messiah and of the ideal Sufferer, implicitly convey the same thought. Consequently, numerous passages in Isaiah, Micah, Daniel, Zechariah, Malachi, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a> and Psalms 72, 45, etc., taken in connection with prediction of the sorrows of Messiah, did prepare the disciples to believe that the Holy One could not be holden by the pangs of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a>, etc.). Before closing this paragraph, we must notice that, in this entire transaction, the Lord is not separating himself from the existing theocracy, but interpreting its highest meaning. In the cleansing of the temple at the last he was judging and condemning. The vindication by our Lord of his own action was very different on the latter occasion from what it is here (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-16.htm">John 2:16</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-17.htm">Mark 11:17</a>), and numerous other accompaniments are profoundly different; nor did he then speak of the destruction of the temple, although, as we have seen, much exaggerated and mis-apprehensive talk concerning him had been floating among the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-61.htm">Matthew 26:61</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Was risen (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>Rev., more correctly, was raised.

The meaning is, therefore, they believed that the Scripture was true. On &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;, a passage or section of Scripture, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-10.htm">Mark 12:10</a>.<p>In John, as elsewhere, the word almost always refers to a particular passage cited in the context.

For the Old Testament, as a whole, John always uses the plural &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;.
