They place a cleansing of the Temple at the close of our Lord’s ministry at the only Passover which comes within the scope of their narrative. The subject has been dealt with in Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm" title="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,">Matthew 21:12</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> (Comp. also <span class= "ital">Introduction: The Chronological Harmony of the Gospels,</span> p. 35) The careful reader will not fail to observe the graphic touches peculiar to this narrative—the money-changers <span class= "ital">sitting,</span> the sacrificial animals, the making of the scourge, the money poured out, the order to remove the doves which could not be driven out. We feel all through in the presence of an eye-witness. It is worth remembering that on the eve of the Passover the head of every family carefully collected all the leaven in the house, and there was a general cleansing. He was doing in His Father’s house, it may be, what was then being done in every house in Jerusalem. The remark will be seen to have an important bearing on the question of the repetition of the cleansing.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:12-22 The first public work in which we find Christ engaged, was driving from the temple the traders whom the covetous priests and rulers encouraged to make a market-place of its courts. Those now make God's house a house of merchandise, whose minds are filled with cares about worldly business when attending religious exercises, or who perform Divine offices for love of gain. Christ, having thus cleansed the temple, gave a sign to those who demanded it, to prove his authority for so doing. He foretells his death by the Jews' malice, Destroy ye this temple; I will permit you to destroy it. He foretells his resurrection by his own power; In three days I will raise it up. Christ took again his own life. Men mistake by understanding that according to the letter, which the Scripture speaks by way of figure. When Jesus was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered he has said this. It helps much in understanding the Divine word, to observe the fulfilling of the Scriptures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Jews' passover - The feast among the Jews called the Passover. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-2.htm">Matthew 26:2-17</a>.<p>And Jesus went up to Jerusalem - Every male among the Jews was required to appear at this feast. Jesus, in obedience to the law, went up to observe it. This is the first Passover on which he attended after he entered on the work of the ministry. It is commonly supposed that he observed three others one recorded <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-1.htm">Luke 6:1</a>; another <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>, and the last one on the night before he was crucified, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55</a>. As his baptism when he entered on his ministry had taken place some time before this - probably not far from six months - it follows that the period of his ministry was not far from three years and a half, agreeably to the prophecy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Joh 2:13-25.

None of the other evangelists make mention of more than one passover between the time of Christ’s baptism and death: John plainly mentions three, one here, another in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a></span>, the last, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-39.htm" title="But you have a custom, that I should release to you one at the passover: will you therefore that I release to you the King of the Jews?">John 18:39</a></span>; and some think that he mentions another, though more obscurely, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-1.htm" title="After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 5:1</a></span>. Our Lord was at them all. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Jews' passover was at hand,.... That feast which was kept on the fourteenth day of Nisan, in commemoration of the Lord's passing over, and by the houses of the Israelites, when he slew the firstborn in Egypt: and it is called the Jews' passover, because they only were obliged to keep it: nor was it obligatory upon the Gentiles; and, besides, was now abolished when John wrote this Gospel, though still retained by the Jews. And moreover, John was now among the Gentiles, and for whose sake he penned this Gospel; and therefore so distinguishes this feast, which was typical of the Christian passover, or of Christ our passover that is sacrificed for us. This was the first "passover" after Christ's baptism, which is generally thought to have been about half a year before; though so much time cannot be made out from the scriptural account; for from his baptism, to his return out of the wilderness to John, were forty days; and from thence, to his coming to Cana, four or, five days more; and perhaps he might be seven days in Cana; for so long a wedding was usually kept; and his stay at Capernaum was but a few days; all which do not amount to above eight or nine weeks at most: the second passover after this, is, by some, thought to be the feast mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-1.htm">John 5:1</a>, and the third in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>, and the fourth and last, at which he suffered, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>. The Evangelist John is the only writer that gives an account of the passovers after Christ entered on his public ministry; by which is known the duration of it, which is generally thought to be about three years and a half. "Three years and a half", the Jews say (a), the Shekinah sat upon the Mount of Olives, expecting that the Israelites would repent, but they did not; and this seems to be the term of time for disciples to learn of their masters: it is said (b), one came from Athens to Jerusalem, and he served "three years and a half" to learn the doctrine of wisdom, and he learned it not. <p>And Jesus went up to Jerusalem; not alone, but his disciples with him, as appears from <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>, to keep the passover as he had been wont to do, and as the law required; and he being under the law, as a son of Abraham, and the surety of his people, it became him to fulfil all righteousness, ceremonial, as well as moral, and which he strictly observed. He is said to go up to Jerusalem, because that stood on higher ground than the low lands of Galilee, and was the only place where the passover might be kept; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>. <p>(a) Praefat.

An indication that this Gospel was written outside Palestine: one writing in the country would hardly have added ‘of the Jews.’ It is perhaps also an indication that this Gospel was written after a Passover <span class="ital">of the Christians</span> had come into recognition. Passovers were active times in Christ’s ministry; and this is the first of them. It was possibly the nearness of the Passover which caused this traffic in the Temple Court. It existed for the convenience of strangers. Certainly the nearness of the Feast would add significance to Christ’s action. While the Jews were purifying themselves for the Passover He purified the Temple. S. John groups his narrative round the Jewish festivals: we have (1) Passover; (2) Purim (?), <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-1.htm" title="After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 5:1</a>; (3) Passover, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>; (4) Tabernacles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-2.htm" title="Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.">John 7:2</a>; (5) Dedication, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-22.htm" title="And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.">John 10:22</a>; (6) Passover, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-55.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was near at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify themselves.">John 11:55</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 2:13</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-57.htm" title="Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should show it, that they might take him.">John 11:57</a>.</span> The Work<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We here enter on the second portion of the first main division of the Gospel, thus subdivided:—The Work (1) among <span class="ital">Jews</span>, (2) among <span class="ital">Samaritans</span>, (3) among <span class="ital">Galileans</span>, (4) among <span class="ital">mixed multitudes</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 2:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ πάσχα</span>, <span class="ital">the Passover</span>) About the times of the Passover the office of Christ was in especially fruitful exercise.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The Jews' passover<p>On John's use of the term Jews, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>.

The same hint underlies the words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>, "after the Jews' manner of purifying." Only John mentions this earliest passover of Christ's ministry. The Synoptists relate no incident of his ministry in Judaea, and but for the narrative of John, it could not be positively asserted that Jesus went up to Jerusalem during His public life until the time of His arrest and crucifixion. </body></html>
