What water became wine? The text itself does not speak of “water now become wine” until the ruler of the feast tasted it, and immediately afterwards speaks of it as “water,” when the servants drew it, for the plain reference of the parenthesis in brackets is to the drawing of the water from the pitchers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-8.htm" title="And he said to them, Draw out now, and bear to the governor of the feast. And they bore it.">John 2:8</a>), not to a previous drawing of water to place in the pitchers, which has not been even hinted at. Unless, then, there is a strong reason which does not appear in these words, this simple meaning is the true one;—that the change took place during or after the drawing from the pitchers, and that that portion only was changed which was carried to the ruler and actually needed to supply the guests. The reason based upon the mention of the number and contents of the pitchers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-6.htm" title="And there were set there six water pots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.">John 2:6</a>) is certainly not a strong one. It is quite natural to find these stated in the picturesque style of this Gospel, and there is no care to give more than a rough estimate of the size from a remembrance either of these pitchers or of pitchers generally used for this purpose. There is more force in the general impression derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-7.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.">John 2:7</a>. It may be fairly asked why was more water placed in readiness than was needed? But the pitchers would be in any case re-filled for ablutions after the feast. They were at hand, meeting the eye. All possibility of collusion is thus excluded. They had been used not long before; they would very soon be used again. The filling of all leaves to the servants the choice of one or more from which to draw. There is an unfailing potential supply; it becomes an actual supply only when needed and appropriated by human want. This, as every supernatural work, is made to depend upon faith. There is no demand for this faith in filling <span class= "ital">water</span>-pots with <span class= "ital">water;</span> it is otherwise when they draw it, and bear it in the usual tankard to the ruler, in answer to the demand for <span class= "ital">wine.</span> Here, as everywhere in divine action, there is an economy in the use of power. There is no miracle of “luxury” or “waste” or “excess.” These cavils of the higher criticism are—like the additions of expositors, as that the feast lasted for a week or more, or their perversions, as that the wine was in no sense intoxicating—superstructures without a foundation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-11 It is very desirable when there is a marriage, to have Christ own and bless it. Those that would have Christ with them at their marriage, must invite him by prayer, and he will come. While in this world we sometimes find ourselves in straits, even when we think ourselves in fulness. There was want at a marriage feast. Those who are come to care for the things of the world, must look for trouble, and count upon disappointment. In our addresses to Christ, we must humbly spread our case before him, and then refer ourselves to him to do as he pleases. In Christ's reply to his mother there was no disrespect. He used the same word when speaking to her with affection from the cross; yet it is a standing testimony against the idolatry of after-ages, in giving undue honours to his mother. His hour is come when we know not what to do. Delays of mercy are not denials of prayer. Those that expect Christ's favours, must observe his orders with ready obedience. The way of duty is the way to mercy; and Christ's methods must not be objected against. The beginning of Moses' miracles was turning water into blood, Ex 7:20; the beginning of Christ's miracles was turning water into wine; which may remind us of the difference between the law of Moses and the gospel of Christ. He showed that he improves creature-comforts to all true believers, and make them comforts indeed. And Christ's works are all for use. Has he turned thy water into wine, given thee knowledge and grace? it is to profit withal; therefore draw out now, and use it. It was the best wine. Christ's works commend themselves even to those who know not their Author. What was produced by miracles, always was the best in its kind. Though Christ hereby allows a right use of wine, he does not in the least do away his own caution, which is, that our hearts be not at any time overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, Lu 21:34. Though we need not scruple to feast with our friends on proper occasions, yet every social interview should be so conducted, that we might invite the Redeemer to join with us, if he were now on earth; and all levity, luxury, and excess offend him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And knew not whence it was - This is said, probably, to indicate that his judgment was not biased by any favor, or any lack of favor, toward Jesus. Had he known what was done, he would have been less likely to have judged impartially. As it is, we have his testimony that this was real wine, and of so fine a body and flavor as to surpass that which had been provided for the occasion. Everything in this miracle shows that there was no collusion or understanding between Jesus and any of the persons at the feast. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10. well drunk&#8212;"drunk abundantly" (as So 5:1), speaking of the general practice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Our Saviour’s action, by which he turned the water into wine, being not obvious to the senses of any; but only the secret motion of his will, willing the thing to be; is not recorded, only the effect and the consequents of it are.

See Kühner, <span class="ital">ad Xen. Anab</span>. iv. 6. 1. The <span class="greekheb">τό</span> not being repeated, the <span class="greekheb">ὕδωρ οἶν</span>. <span class="greekheb">γεγεν</span>. expresses one complete conception.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πόθεν ἐστίν</span>] <span class="ital">whence it comes, i.e.</span> that it had been drawn out of the water-pitchers.

We may suppose the words to have been spoken jocularly, in joyous surprise after tasting the wine. The general custom, however, to which the table-master refers, is not elsewhere with any certainty confirmed (the proof in Wetstein is doubtful); nor, indeed, considering the playful way in which it was spoken, does it need any voucher.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅταν μεθυσθῶσι</span>] <span class="ital">when they have become intoxicated</span>, so that they can no longer appreciate the goodness of the wine. The word does not mean anything else; not <span class="ital">when they have well drunk</span> (Tholuck, De Wette, and several, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Beza, Cornelius a Lapide, and others), because <span class="ital">intoxication</span> is the essential though relative conception (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-34.htm" title="And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.">Genesis 43:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-6.htm" title="You have sown much, and bring in little; you eat, but you have not enough; you drink, but you are not filled with drink; you clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earns wages earns wages to put it into a bag with holes.">Haggai 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-2.htm" title="With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.">Revelation 17:2</a>). The man says only in joke, as if it were a <span class="ital">general experience</span>, what he certainly may often have observed, and no inference can therefore be drawn from his words that the guests at Cana were already intoxicated; especially as <span class="greekheb">ὥς ἄρτι</span> simply means <span class="ital">till now</span>, after they had been drinking so long at the table, in antithesis with the <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-9.htm" title="When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not from where it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,">John 2:9</a>. The architriklinos, then, when he had tasted the water which had now become wine, and did not know whence it had been procured, and was therefore impartially judging it merely as wine among wines, <span class="greekheb">φωνεῖ τὸν νυμφίον</span>, “calls the bridegroom,” or simply “addresses the bridegroom,” and says to him <span class="greekheb">πᾶς ἄνθρωπος</span> … The usage referred to was natural: and is illustrated by the <span class="greekheb">ἑωλοκρασία</span>, the mixture of all the heeltaps with which the harder heads dosed the drunken at the end of a debauch.—<span class="greekheb">ὅταν μεθυσθῶσι</span>, “when men have drunk freely,” R.V[33] The Vulgate more accurately has “cum inebriati fuerint”. And if the word does not definitely mean “when men are intoxicated,” it at least must indicate a condition in which they are unfit to discriminate between good wine and bad. The company then present was not in that condition, because they were able to appreciate the good wine; but the words of the architriklinos unquestionably imply that a good deal had already been drunk. The <span class="greekheb">ἕως ἄρτι</span> involves this. The significance of the remark consists in the certificate thus given to the quality of the wine. Bengel felicitously says: “Ignorantia architriclini comprobat bonitatem vini: scientia ministrorum veritatem miraculi”. Judging it by his natural taste and comparing it with the wine supplied by the host, the architriklinos pronounces this fresh supply better. What Christ introduces into the world will stand comparison with what is already in it. Christian grace must manifest itself not in sanctimonious and unpractical displays, but must stand comparison with the rough natural virtues, the courage, generosity, and force which are called for in the practical affairs of life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[33] Revised Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">ruler of the feast</span>] Perhaps <span class="ital">manager of the feast</span> would be better. It is doubtful whether the head-waiter, who managed the feast and tasted the meat and drink, is meant, or the <span class="ital">rex convivii, arbiter bibendi</span>, the guest elected by the other guests to preside. The bad taste of his remark inclines one to the former alternative: <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/32-1.htm" title="If thou be made the master of a feast, lift not thyself up, but be among them as one of the rest; take diligent care for them, and so sit down....">Sir 32:1-2</a> is in favour of the second. In any case the translation should be uniform in these two verses, not sometimes ‘governor,’ sometimes ‘ruler.’ It is the same Greek word in all three cases, a word occurring nowhere else in N.T. The words also for ‘water-pot’ or ‘pitcher’ and for ‘draw out’ are peculiar to this Gospel; but they occur again <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-7.htm" title="There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus said to her, Give me to drink.">John 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-15.htm" title="The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw.">John 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-28.htm" title="The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and said to the men,">John 4:28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the water that was made wine</span>] Or, <span class="ital">the water now become wine</span>. The Greek seems to imply that all the water had become wine; there is nothing to mark a distinction between what was now wine and what still remained water. It is idle to ask at what precise moment the water became wine: nor is much gained by representing the miracle as a series of natural processes (rain passing through the vine into the grapes, being pressed out and fermented, &c.) compressed into an instant. Such compression is neither more nor less intelligible than simple transition from water to wine. Moreover there was no vine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which drew</span>] Better, <span class="bld">who had drawn</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">called</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">calleth</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-9.htm" title="When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not from where it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,">John 2:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ἀρχιτρίκλινος</span>, <span class="ital">the governor of the feast</span>) who was directing the whole management of the feast: one skilled in deciding a question of taste.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ὕδωρ</span>) The Article marks the subject.—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ᾔδει</span>· <span class="greekheb">ᾔδεισαν</span>, <span class="ital">did not know: they knew) The ignorance</span> of the governor of the feast proves the goodness of the wine: the knowledge of the servants[proves] the truth of the miracle.—<span class="greekheb">φωνεῖ</span>) <span class="ital">calls</span>: it is not added, <span class="ital">to himself</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the governor of the feast tasted the water which had become wine.</span> Luther translated, "Den Wein der Wasser gewesen war" - "The wine which had been water." No other explanation is possible than one that asserts an astounding contravention of the ordinary evolutions and sequences of nature. If wine has taken the place of water, there has been added to the water that which was not there before. The vine, with all its wondrous processes - the vineyard, the wine press, and other appliances - have all been dispensed with, and the same power which said, "Let there be light," called these additional elements together, originated them by his will. The new properties presented themselves to the percipient senses. In this respect the transformation is profoundly different from the supposed change which occurs in the Holy Eucharist. There the accidents and elements all remain; the <span class="accented">substantia</span> underlying them is supposed to be replaced by another <span class="accented">substantia</span>; but neither the one nor the other substance has ever been present to the senses. Here a new substance, with previously undiscovered attributes, presents itself. The uncompromising opponents of the supernatural will accept almost any interpretation but that which lies on the surface. The rationalistic, mythical, poetic mystic explanations all alike are encumbered with special difficulties. The evangelist who held Christ to be the Logos incarnate saw nothing inconceivable in the event. It was one of many phenomena which accompanied his life as the "Son of man," which helped to create the underlying presupposition on which the Gospel was written. Like the testimony of the last of the prophets and the earliest of the disciples, it is part of the evidence that the Logos dwelt among us. When the governor tasted wine drawn from these water pots, <span class="cmt_word">and knew not whence it was.</span> He had known all the resources of the feast, but this puzzled him by its novelty. "Whence has it come? Where has it been stored? Whose is it?" An interesting parenthesis is here introduced, to contrast the ignorance of the ruler of the feast with the overwhelming mystery of knowledge given to the servants (the disciples of Jesus himself), [<span class="cmt_word">But the servants</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">who drew the water knew</span>]; knew, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, whence it was and, it seems to me, <span class="accented">what</span> it was. Meyer and others say they did not know that they had brought wine. It is impossible to assert as much as this. They knew the plain fact that it was not a wine vat or wine cask, but a water jar, from which they had drawn in order to fill the chalices in their hands. They became, therefore, guarantors of the mysterious sign. How much more than "whence" it was had dawned on their mind we cannot say. <span class="cmt_word">The governor of the feast calleth the bridegroom.</span> We may judge from this that this responsible person was not in the room where the six water jars were placed, and that he either approached the bridegroom in his seat of honour, or called to him from his own, and expressed, by a convivial boast and equivocal compliment, his sense of the excellence of the wine which had thus, at the end of the feast, been lavished on the guests, who had been hitherto kept strangely ignorant of the resources of the host. It is unnecessary to put into the words any meaning deeper than the epigrammatic humour in which he revealed his sense of the reality of the objective fact which had been brought to his knowledge. </body></html>
