The last words, in italics, which are an explanatory gloss, should also be omitted. The verse will then read, “But Jesus stooped down, and with His finger wrote on the ground”—or, more exactly, <span class= "ital">was writing on the ground.</span> It is the imperfect of the continued action, and it points to the narrator’s vivid remembrance of the scene. What precise meaning we are to attach to this action is, and must remain, uncertain. Any inquiry as to what He wrote is excluded by the fact that the narrative would certainly have recorded it had it been known; and though writing on sand was practised in the Rabbinic schools, this writing was on the pavement of the Temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-2.htm" title="And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down, and taught them.">John 8:2</a>). We have to seek the meaning, then, in the symbolism of the action, remembering that the teaching by action and gesture, common everywhere, has always been specially common in the East; and of the many interpretations which may be given, that which seems upon the whole least liable to objection is, that He deprecated the office of judge which they wished to impose on Him, and chose this method of intimating that He took no interest in what they were saying. The commentators tell us that this was a common method of signifying intentional disregard.<p>An alternative interpretation may be suggested. They had quoted the Law, and asked for His opinion. They were themselves the interpreters of the Law. He claimed no such office. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-14.htm" title="And he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?">Luke 12:14</a>.) He stoops down and writes, and the action intimates that the Law of God was written on tables of stone, and its decrees were immutable. They, by their technical interpretation and tradition, were making it of none effect. He came to fulfil it. The majesty of duty is sinned against by these refinements of casuistry. They are now daring to violate the sacredness of law by making it the subject of a question by which they hope to encompass His death. The solemn silence, as He stooped down in that Temple and wrote upon its pavement, must have spoken in a power greater than that of words.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-11 Christ neither found fault with the law, nor excused the prisoner's guilt; nor did he countenance the pretended zeal of the Pharisees. Those are self-condemned who judge others, and yet do the same thing. All who are any way called to blame the faults of others, are especially concerned to look to themselves, and keep themselves pure. In this matter Christ attended to the great work about which he came into the world, that was, to bring sinners to repentance; not to destroy, but to save. He aimed to bring, not only the accused to repentance, by showing her his mercy, but the prosecutors also, by showing them their sins; they thought to insnare him, he sought to convince and convert them. He declined to meddle with the magistrate's office. Many crimes merit far more severe punishment than they meet with; but we should not leave our own work, to take that upon ourselves to which we are not called. When Christ sent her away, it was with this caution, Go, and sin no more. Those who help to save the life of a criminal, should help to save the soul with the same caution. Those are truly happy, whom Christ does not condemn. Christ's favour to us in the forgiveness of past sins should prevail with us, Go then, and sin no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tempting him - Trying him, or laying a plan that they might have occasion to accuse him. If he decided the case, they expected to be able to bring an accusation against him; for if he decided that she ought to die, they might accuse him of claiming power which belonged to the Romans - the power of life and death. They might allege that it was not the giving an opinion about an abstract case, but that she was formally before him, that he decided her case judicially, and that without authority or form of trial. If he decided otherwise, they would have alleged that he denied the authority of the law, and that it was his intention to abrogate it. They had had a controversy with him about the authority of the Sabbath, and they perhaps supposed that he would decide this case as he did that - against them. It may be further added that they knew that Jesus admitted publicans and sinners to eat with him; that one of their charges was that he was friendly to sinners (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-2.htm">Luke 15:2</a>); and they wished, doubtless, to make it appear that he was gluttonous, and a winebibber, and a friend of sinners, and disposed to relax all the laws of morality, even in the case of adultery. Seldom was there a plan more artfully laid, and never was more wisdom and knowledge of human nature displayed than in the manner in which it was met.<p>Wrote on the ground - This took place in the temple. The "ground," here, means the pavement, or the dust on the pavement. By this Jesus showed them clearly that he was not solicitous to pronounce an opinion in the case, and that it was not his wish or intention to intermeddle with the civil affairs of the nation.<p>As though he heard them not - This is added by the translators. It is not in the original, and should not have been added. There is no intimation in the original, as it seems to be implied by this addition, that the object was to convey the impression that he did not hear them. What was his object is unknown, and conjecture is useless. The most probable reason seems to be that he did not wish to intermeddle; that he designed to show no solicitude to decide the case; and that he did not mean to decide it unless he was constrained to. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. stooped down&#8212;It will be observed He was sitting when they came to Him.<p>with his finger wrote on the ground&#8212;The words of our translators in italics ("as though He heard them not") have hardly improved the sense, for it is scarcely probable He could wish that to be thought. Rather He wished to show them His aversion to enter on the subject. But as this did not suit them, they "continue asking Him," pressing for an answer. At last, raising Himself He said.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Their design was from his answer to take some colourable pretence to accuse, and either to discredit him with the people, or to expose him to the displeasure of the superior powers. If he had directed to send her to be punished by the Roman governors, who administered justice in capital causes, the people would be fired with indignation; for they looked upon them as invaders of the rights of government that belonged to the Israelites. If he had advised them to put her to death by their own power, they would have accused him of sedition, as an enemy of the Roman authority. If he had dismissed her as not worthy of death, they would have accused him to the sanhedrim, as an infringer of the law of Moses, as a favourer of dissoluteness, an enemy to civil society, and worthy of universal hatred. This malicious design, so craftily concerted, our Saviour easily discovered and defeated; whereas they thought it would require his most attentive consideration to extricate himself from the snare. He seemed not at all to attend to what they said, but, stooping down, wrote on the ground: what he wrote, or how he could write upon the floor of the temple, (which was of stone), are very idle questions; the first not possible to be resolved, the second impertinent; for it is not said, that he made any impression upon the ground, though it be said, he wrote upon it. It appeareth plainly to have been but a divertive action, by which our Saviour signified that he gave no ear to them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>This they said, tempting him,.... For they brought this woman, and exposed her in this manner, not because of their abhorrence and detestation of the sin; nor did they put the above question to Christ, out of their great respect to the law of Moses; which in many instances, and so in this, they in a great measure made void, by their traditions; for they say, that for such an offence as adultery, they did not put to death, nor beat, unless there was a previous admonition; the use of which was, to distinguish between presumptuous sins, and wilful ones (m); but if there was no admonition, and the woman, even a married woman, if she confessed the crime, all her punishment was to have her dowry taken from her, or to go away without it (n): now these masters say nothing about the admonition, nor do they put the question, whether this woman was to be dealt with according to their traditions, or according to the law of Moses? but what was the sense of Christ, whether Moses's law was to be attended to, or whether he would propose another rule to go by? and their view in this was, <p>that they might have to accuse him; that should he agree with Moses, then they would accuse him to the Roman governor, for taking upon him to condemn a person to death, which belonged to him to do; or they would charge him with severity, and acting inconsistently with himself, who received such sort of sinners, and ate with them; and had declared, that publicans and harlots would enter into the kingdom of heaven, when the Scribes and Pharisees would not; and if he should disagree with Moses, then they would traduce him among the people, as an enemy to Moses and his law, and as a patron of the most scandalous enormities: <p>but Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground; some think (o) he wrote in legible characters the sins of the woman's accusers; and the learned Wagenseil (p) makes mention of an ancient Greek manuscript he had seen, in which were the following words, "the sins of everyone of them": Dr. Lightfoot is of opinion, that this action of Christ tallies with, and has some reference to, the action of the priest at the trial of the suspected wife; who took of the dust of the floor of the tabernacle, and infused it in the bitter waters for her to drink; but it is most likely, that Christ on purpose put himself into this posture, as if he was busy about something else, and did not attend to what they said; and hereby cast some contempt upon them, as if they and their question were unworthy of his notice: and this sense is confirmed by what follows, <p>as though he heard them not; though this clause is not in many copies, nor in the Vulgate Latin, nor in any of the Oriental versions, but is in five of Beza's copies, and in the Complutensian edition. <p>(See <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a>, "they that depart from me shall be wriiten in the earth".

But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.">John 8:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πειράζοντες αὐτόν</span>] denoting, not a good-natured questioning (Olshausen), but, agreeably to the standing <span class="ital">synoptical</span> representation of the relation of those men to Jesus, and in keeping with what immediately follows, <span class="ital">malicious tempting</span>. The <span class="ital">insidious</span> feature of the plan consisted in this: “If He decides <span class="ital">with</span> Moses <span class="ital">for</span> the stoning, He will be accused before the Roman authorities; for, according to the Roman criminal law, adultery was not punishable with death, and stoning in particular was generally repudiated by the Romans (see Staeudlin and Hug). But if He decides <span class="ital">against</span> Moses and <span class="ital">against</span> stoning, He will then be prosecuted before the Sanhedrim as an opposer of the law.” That they expected and wished for the <span class="ital">former</span> result, is shown, by the <span class="ital">prejudicial</span> way in which they introduce the question, by quoting the express punishment prescribed by Moses.[3] Their plan here is similar in design to that of the question touching the tribute money in Matthew 22. It is objected that the Romans in the provinces did not administer justice strictly in accordance with their own laws; but amid the general immorality of the times they certainly did not conform to the rigour of the Mosaic punishment for adultery; and how easy would it have been before the Roman magistrates to give a revolutionary aspect to the hoped-for decision of Jesus in favour of Moses, even if He had in some way reserved the competency of the Roman authorities! If it be said that Jesus needed only to declare Himself in favour of execution, and not exactly for <span class="ital">stoning</span>, it is overlooked that here was the <span class="ital">very</span> case for which <span class="ital">stoning</span> was expressly appointed. If it be urged, lastly, that when Jesus was required to assume the position of a judge, He needed only to <span class="ital">refer</span> His questioners to the <span class="ital">Sanhedrim</span>, and to tell them to take the woman <span class="ital">thither</span> (Ebrard), that would have amounted to a <span class="ital">declining</span> to answer, which would, indeed, have been the surest way of escape from the dilemma, but inappropriate enough to the intellectual temperament of Jesus in such cases. <span class="ital">Other explanations</span> of <span class="greekheb">πειράζειν</span>—(1) They would either have accused him to the Romans <span class="ital">imminutae majestatis</span>, because they then possessed the jus vitae et necis, or to the Jews <span class="ital">imminutae libertatis</span> (Grotius), and as a false Messiah (Godet). But that prerogative of the Romans was not infringed by the pronouncing of a sentence of <span class="ital">condemnation;</span> it was still reserved to them through their having to confirm and carry out the sentence. Accordingly, B. Crusius gives this turn to the question: “Would Jesus decide for the popular <span class="ital">execution</span> of the law … or would He peradventure even take upon Himself to pass such a judgment” (so, substantially, Hitzig also, on <span class="ital">Joh. Markus</span>, p. 205 ff., and Luthardt), where (with Wetstein and Schulthess) the law of the Zealots is called in by way of help? But in that case the interrogators, who intended to make use of a negative answer against Him as an overturning of the law, and an affirmative reply as an interference with the functions of the authorities, would then have put <span class="ital">no question at all</span> relating to the thing which they really wanted (<span class="ital">i.e. the execution</span>, and that immediate and tumultuous). (2) As the punishment of death for adultery had at that time already fallen into disuse, the drift of their question was simply, <span class="ital">whether or not legal proceedings should be instituted at all</span> (Ebrard, following Michaelis). The words themselves, and the design expressed in the <span class="greekheb">κατῃγορεῖν</span>, which could not take place before the <span class="ital">people</span>, but before the competent judges, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-10.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.">Matthew 12:10</a>, are quite opposed to this explanation. (3) Dieck, in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1832, p. 791, says: As the punishment of death for adultery presupposes <span class="ital">liberty of divorcement</span>, and as Jesus had Himself <span class="ital">repudiated</span> divorce, He would, by pronouncing <span class="ital">in favour of</span> that punishment, have contradicted Himself; while, by pronouncing <span class="ital">against</span> it, He would have appeared as a despiser of the law. But apart from the improbability of any such logical calculation on the part of His questioners as to the first alternative,—a calculation which is indicated by nothing in the text,—the <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἔχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κατηγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτ</span>. is decisive against this explanation; for a want of logical consistency would have furnished no <span class="ital">ground for accusation</span>.[4] (4) The same argument tells against Augustine, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, Aretius, Jansen, Cornelius à Lapide, Baumgarten, and many other expositors: according to whom an <span class="ital">affirmative</span> reply would have been <span class="ital">inconsistent with the general mildness</span> of His teaching; a <span class="ital">negative</span> answer would have been a decision against Moses. (5) Euthymius Zigabenus, Bengel, and many others, Neander also, Tholuck, Baeumlein, Hengstenberg (who sees here an unhistorical mingling of law and gospel), are nearer the mark in regarding the plan of attack as based upon the assumption, which they regarded as certain, that in accordance with His usual gentleness He would give a <span class="ital">negative</span> answer: <span class="greekheb">γινώσκοντες γὰρ αὐτὸν ἐλεήμονα κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συμπαθῆ</span>, <span class="greekheb">προσεδόκων</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι φείσεται αὐτῆς</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ λοιπὸν ἕξουσι κατηγορίαν κατʼ αὐτὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς παρανόμως φειδομένου τῆς ἀπὸ τοῦ νόμου λιθαζομένης</span>, Euthymius Zigabenus. But this explanation also must be rejected, partly even on <span class="ital">à priori</span> grounds, because an ensnaring casuistic question may naturally be supposed to involve a <span class="ital">dilemma;</span> partly and mainly because in this case the introduction of the question by <span class="greekheb">ἐν δὲ τῷ νόμῳ</span> would have been a very unwise method of preparing the way for a <span class="ital">negative</span> answer. This latter argument tells against Ewald, who holds that Christ, by the acquittal which they deemed it probable He would pronounce, would have offended against the Mosaic law; while by condemning, He would have violated as well the milder practice then in vogue as His own more gentle principles. Lücke, De Wette, Brückner, Baur,[5] and many other expositors <span class="ital">renounce</span> the attempt to give any satisfactory solution of the difficulty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῷ δακτύλῳ ἔγραφεν εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γῆν</span>] as a sign that He was not considering their question, <span class="greekheb">ὅπερ εἰώθασι πολλάκις ποιεῖν οἱ μὴ θέλοντες ἀποκρίνεσθαι πρὸς τοὺς ἐρωτῶντας ἄκαιρα καὶ ἀνάξια</span>. <span class="greekheb">Γνοὺς γὰρ αὐτῶν τὴν μηχανὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">προσεποιεῖτο γράφειν εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γῆν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ μὴ προσέχειν οἷς ἔλεγον</span>, Euthymius Zigabenus. For instances of behaviour like this on the part of one who turns away from those around him, and becomes absorbed in himself, giving himself up to his own thoughts or imaginings, from Greek writers (Aristoph. <span class="ital">Acharn</span>. 31, and Schol. Diog. Laert. 2. 127) and from the Rabbins, see in Wetstein. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm" title="The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.">Isaiah 17:13</a> does not here serve for elucidation. <span class="ital">What</span> Jesus wrote is not a subject even of inquiry; nor are we to ask whether, by the act, He was symbolizing any, and if so what, <span class="ital">answer</span> (Michaelis: the answer “<span class="ital">as it is written</span>”). There is much marvellous conjecture among the older expositors. See Wolf and Lampe, also Fabricius, <span class="ital">Cod. Apocr</span>. p. 315, who thinks that Jesus wrote the answer given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-7.htm" title="So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.">John 8:7</a> (after Bede; comp. also Ewald, <span class="ital">Gesch. Chr</span>. p. 480, ed. 3, and Godet). Suffice it to say, the strange manner in which Jesus silently declines to give a decisive reply (acting, no doubt, according to His principle of not interfering with the sphere of the magistracy (here a matter of criminal law, Matthew 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/12-13.htm" title="And one of the company said to him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me....">Luke 12:13-14</a>),[6] bears the stamp of genuineness and not of invention, though Hengstenberg deems this procedure unworthy of Jesus; the tempters <span class="ital">deserved</span> the <span class="ital">contempt</span> which this implied, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-9.htm" title="And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.">John 8:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe in <span class="greekheb">ἔγραφεν</span> the descriptive imperfect. The reader <span class="ital">sees</span> Him writing with His finger. The additions in some Codd. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τροσποιούμενος</span>, and (more strongly attested) <span class="greekheb">μὴ προσποιούμ</span>., are glosses of different kinds, meaning “<span class="ital">though He only pretended</span> (<span class="ital">simulans</span>) to write;” and, “<span class="ital">without troubling Himself about them</span>” (<span class="ital">dissimulans</span>, Ev. 32 adds <span class="greekheb">αὐτούς</span>). See Matthaei, ed. min, <span class="ital">in loc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3] </span>Observe also, in reference to this, the <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> in ver. 5, which logically paves the way for an answer in agreement with Moses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[4] What they really wished was to <span class="ital">accuse</span> Him, on the ground of the answer He would give. Hilgenfeld therefore is in error when he thinks they sought to force Him to give a decisive utterance as the <span class="ital">obligation of the Mosaic law</span>. By an affirmative reply (he says) Christ would have recognised this obligation, and by His non-observance of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm" title="Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.">John 5:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-23.htm" title="If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are you angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?">John 7:23</a>) He would have been self-condemned; by a negative answer He would have been guilty of an express rejection of the law. Viewing the matter thus, they could not, indeed, have <span class="ital">accused</span> Him on account of His answer if affirmative; they could only have charged Him with logical inconsistency. This tells substantially also against Lange’s view, viz. that they wished to see whether He would venture, in the strength of His Messianic authority, to set up a new law. If in this case He had decided <span class="ital">in favour of</span> Moses, they could not have <span class="ital">accused</span> Him (to the Sanhedrim).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[5] According to Baur (p. 170 sq.), there is nothing historical whatever in the story; it has a purely ideal import. The main idea he holds to be the consciousness of one’s own sinfulness breaking the power of every sin, in opposition to the accusation brought against Jesus by the Pharisees, that He associated with sinners, and thus was so ready to forgive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[6] According to Luthardt, to show that the malice of the question <span class="ital">did not deserve an answer</span>. But the numerous testing questions proposed to Him, according to the Synoptics, by His opponents, were all of them malicious; yet Jesus did not refuse to reply to them. According to Lange’s fancy, Jesus assumed the gesture of <span class="ital">a calm majesty</span>, which, in its <span class="ital">playful ease</span>, refused to be disturbed by any <span class="ital">street scandal</span>. Melancthon well says: “Initio, cum accusatur mulier, nihil respondit Christus, <span class="ital">tanquam in aliam rem intentus, videlicet prorsus a sese rejiciens hanc quaestionem pertinentem ad cognitionem magistratus politici.</span> Postea, cum urgetur, respondet non de muliere, sed de ipsorum peccatis, qui ipsam accusabant.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-6.htm" title="This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him.

See Holtzmann. Their plot was unsuccessful; Jesus as He sat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-2.htm" title="And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down, and taught them.">John 8:2</a>), <span class="greekheb">κάτω κύψας</span> … <span class="greekheb">γῆν</span>, “bent down and began to write with His finger on the ground,” intimating that their question would not be answered; perhaps also some measure of that embarrassment on account of “shame of the deed itself and the brazen hardness of the prosecutors” which is overstated in <span class="ital">Ecce Homo</span>, p. 104. The scraping or drawing figures on the ground with a stick or the finger has been in many countries a common expression of deliberate silence or embarrassment. [<span class="greekheb">ὅπερ εἰώθασι πολλάκις ποιεῖν οἱ μὴ θέλοντες ἀποκρίνεσθαι πρὸς τοὺς ἐρωτῶντας ἄκαιρα καὶ ἀνάξια</span>, Euthymius.] Interesting passages are cited by Wetstein and Kypke, in one of which Euripides is cited as saying: <span class="greekheb">τὴν σιωπὴν τοῖς σοφοῖς ἀπόκρισιν εἶναι</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">tempting him</span>] The Greek word for ‘tempting’ is frequent in the Synoptists of trying to place Christ in a difficulty; never so used in S. John, who, however, uses it once of Christ ‘proving’ Philip (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-6.htm" title="And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.">John 6:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that they might have to accuse him</span>] This clause must be borne in mind in determining what the difficulty was in which they wished to place Him. It seems to exclude the supposition that they hoped to undermine His popularity, in case He should decide for the extreme rigour of the law; the people having become accustomed to a lax morality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-39.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:">Matthew 12:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-38.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.">Mark 8:38</a>). Probably the case is somewhat parallel to the question about tribute, and they hoped to bring Him into collision either with the Law and Sanhedrin or with the Roman Government. If He said she was <span class="ital">not</span> to be stoned, He contradicted Jewish Law; if He said she <span class="ital">was</span> to be stoned, He ran counter to Roman Law, for the Romans had deprived the Jews of the right to inflict capital punishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-31.htm" title="Then said Pilate to them, Take you him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:">John 18:31</a>).

McClellan quotes Plut. ii. 532: ‘Without uttering a syllable, by merely raising the eyebrows, or <span class="ital">stooping down</span>, or <span class="ital">fixing the eyes upon the ground</span>, you may baffle unreasonable importunities.’ ‘Wrote’ should perhaps be ‘kept writing’ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-40.htm" title="Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet....">John 7:40-41</a>), or ‘<span class="ital">began to write</span>, made as though He would write’ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-59.htm" title="And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.">Luke 1:59</a>). Either rendering would agree with this interpretation, which our translators have insisted on as certain by inserting the gloss (not found in any earlier English Version), ‘as though He heard them not.’ But it is just possible that by writing on the stone pavement of the Temple He wished to remind them of the ‘tables of stone, written with the finger of God’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm" title="And the LORD delivered to me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them was written according to all the words, which the LORD spoke with you in the mount out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly.">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>). They were hoping that He would explain away the seventh commandment, in order that they themselves might break the sixth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-6.htm" title="This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him.

They were aware of the leniency of Jesus towards the guilty, as being one who had not come into the world for the sake of executing judgment.—<span class="greekheb">δέ</span>, <span class="ital">but</span>) Men at leisure, when immersed in thought, are wont at times to employ various gestures, which also resemble those of persons writing; and omit these gestures, when anything serious occurs. Very different is the gesture which the Saviour uses here, upon the case having been now submitted to Him by the Scribes and Pharisees; and this He does more than once.—<span class="greekheb">κάτω κύψας</span>, <span class="greekheb">τῷ δακτύλῳ ἔγραφεν εἰς τὴν γῆν</span>, <span class="ital">stooping downwards, He began writing with His finger on the earth</span>) Once only God wrote in the Old Testament, namely, the Decalogue; once too, in the New Testament, Christ wrote: moreover He wrote with His finger; for He who was Wisdom itself did not use a pen [stilus]: also He wrote on the earth, not in the air, not in a tablet; He wrote, in other words, drew, either the forms of letters composing words, perhaps the very words which are mentioned at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-7.htm" title="So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.">John 8:7</a>, “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her;” or else lines and strokes, not having a distinct signification; the characters in either case, when His finger rested, either remaining or disappearing, Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-5.htm" title="In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.">Daniel 5:5</a>, [At Belshazzar’s feast] “came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the kind’s palace.” Writing is wont to be used with a view to future remembrance. Therefore this action seems evidently to require to be interpreted from the words that follow, that the Lord may signify this: Moses wrote the law: I also can write; nay, the law of Moses was My writing. Ye, Scribes, write judgments against others; I also can write against you, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-26.htm" title="I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.">John 8:26</a>, “I have many things to say and to <span class="ital">judge of you</span>.” Your sins have been written in your heart; and your names in the earth: <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm" title="The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven on the table of their heart, and on the horns of your altars;">Jeremiah 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-13.htm" title="O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake you shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.">Jeremiah 17:13</a>, “The sin of Judah is <span class="ital">written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond</span>; it is graven upon <span class="ital">the table of their heart</span>;—they that depart from Me, shall be <span class="ital">written in the earth</span>, because they have forsaken the Lord.” (What suppose that He wrote <span class="ital">the names</span> of the accusers?) This writing of Mine ye do not now understand; but <span class="ital">hereafter</span> it will be made evident to the whole world what I have written, when the books shall be opened, and your foul acts shall all be disclosed. Therefore Jesus, first, by means of this silent action fixed the wandering, hasty, and careless thoughts of His adversaries, and awakened their conscience; second, He intimated, that He at that time had not come to deliver forensic judgments; and that He preferred to do that, which would seem to the unseasonable accusers an idle act, to devoting His attention to a case of that kind (it is to this that the ancient Gloss refers, “He wrote on the earth, <span class="greekheb">μὴ προσποιούμενος</span>, signifying that this business does not belong to Him;” instead of which more modern copies have <span class="greekheb">καὶ προσποιούμενος</span>); that the time when He Himself shall act as Judge, as well with respect to this case, and to these the actors in it, as also with respect to all men, the unjust and just, and that, concerning all things, is not now, but shall be hereafter; that in the meantime all things are recorded in the books; that hereafter the earth will not cover the foul deeds of hypocrites. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-21.htm" title="For, behold, the LORD comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.">Isaiah 26:21</a>, “Behold, the Lord cometh out of His place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; the <span class="ital">earth</span> also shall disclose her blood, and shall <span class="ital">no more cover</span> her slain:” <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-18.htm" title="O earth, cover not you my blood, and let my cry have no place.">Job 16:18</a>, “O earth, cover not thou my blood.” For <span class="ital">writing</span> is wont to be employed for the sake of remembrance against the time to come: <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.">Exodus 17:14</a>, “<span class="ital">Write</span> this <span class="ital">for a memorial</span> in a book;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/102-18.htm" title="This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.">Psalm 102:18</a>, “This shall be <span class="ital">written for the generation to come</span>.” Evidently this action of Jesus Christ has a certain degree of likeness to that ceremony, which was wont to be employed in the case of an adulterous woman: <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-13.htm" title="And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;">Numbers 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-17.htm" title="And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:">Numbers 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-23.htm" title="And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:">Numbers 5:23</a>, etc. [the trial of jealousy by holy water with dust in it from the floor of the sanctuary]: “And the priest shall <span class="ital">write</span> these curses in a book, and shall blot them out with bitter water:” but there is also a dissimilarity; for the law refers to the case of a woman suspected, but this passage, to that of a woman caught in the act; and in the law, the woman drinks the letters written by the priest in a book, and washed out with water, together with the [bitter] water and dust from the ground; but the letters which Jesus wrote on the earth itself, the woman was not able to drink with water, much less without water. Hence it may readily be seen, that, in this action of Jesus, as far as concerns the accused, there is something as it were broken of and left in suspense, in order that He may appear to intimate, that He is indeed the Judge, but that His judgment shall be accomplished not now (for which reason He dismisses the accusers only wounded [not destroyed] for the present), but hereafter; and that then also this adulterous woman shall have her share either of punishment or of complete acquittal.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But this they said tempting him, that they might have</span> (<span class="cmt_word">whereof</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to accuse him</span>. They sought a ground of formal accusation against Jesus. This implies some court before which the charge they desired to formulate it might be brought. The precise accusation is difficult to determine, and sundry distinguished scholars, Lucke, De Wette, and Alford, declare the problem or question insoluble. Augustine has been followed by a great body of expositors, who have supposed that an affirmative reply would have been inconsistent with the gentleness and mildness of our Lord's treatment of sinners, while a negative reply would at once have given them a charge to bring before the Sanhedrin of such a relaxation of the Law as would endanger his position as a Rabbi, still more as the Prophet like unto Moses. Almost all critics agree as to the use to which Christ's enemies were ready to put a <span class="accented">negative</span> reply, and therefore they coincide with Augustine in this part of his explanation. But the interpretation put upon the <span class="accented">affirmative</span> reply would not furnish the ground of any accusation before any court. An apparent inconsistency would be no civil charge, and would have no weight before any legal tribunal. The condemnation of adulterers to death by stoning would have been Christ's allowance of the letter of the Law to stand. The Romans could take no umbrage at this until the act had been carried into execution. It may probably have been known that, let the Sanhedrin record what verdict and punishment they pleased, the Roman magistrates would not have carried it into capital execution. How, then, could the scribes and Pharisees have carried an accusation or information before a Roman tribunal? The solution was  suggested by Baumgarten-Crusius and Luthardt, and adopted by Moulton, that Christ was asked to say "Aye" or "No" to an instant, tumultuous act of vengeance upon the adulteress. Let him say "No," they would accuse him of deliberately ignoring and repudiating the authority of the Law of Moses; let him say "Yes," they were ready to stone the woman there and then, and subsequently to throw the responsibility of such violation of Roman jurisdiction upon the Lord Jesus as its instigator. Meyer's objection, that no <span class="accented">question at all</span> had been put to Christ on this supposition, is not clear. It was this. Clearly apprehending that adultery is a capital offence, and that there was a case before them upon which no doubt could be thrown, they ask him, with the stones in their hands, "Shall we kill this damsel or not?" If he says "No," then they were prepared to denounce the Prophet for his dogmatic trifling with the Law; if "Yes," they are ready to do the deed, and fasten upon Jesus all the shame and guilt of the proceeding before the Roman governor. It was a very analogous problem to that concerning the tribute money recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus stooped down, and with his finger was writing on the ground</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, into the earth). Some manuscripts, E, G, and about ninety cursives, add, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "not troubling himself with them" - "as though he beard them not" (Authorized Version). This act is unparalleled in Scripture, even if the custom is still occasionally practised in the East. Mr. O'Neil, in his instructive volume, 'Palestine Explored,' records a curious instance of a youth, who, after playing some practical joke upon an old man, feigned utter ignorance of the surprise and cry of the old man by instantaneously assuming the position of one entirely abstracted from all sublunary thought, in fact, by sitting on the ground and scribbling with his finger in the dust, "as though he heard and saw nothing of what had happened." Such an intention can only be attributed to our Lord on the understanding that it was a current method of indicating an indisposition to have anything to say to the intruders. He was seated; he turned aside from the excited crowd, and by a significant symbol expressed his displeasure at their proceedings, and his perception of their craftiness. Conjecture has been busy, but vainly, with the inquiry as to what our Lord wrote on the ground, and some have urged (Godet) that he wrote the memorable sentence which follows, as a judge might write the verdict upon the case submitted to him. This is not probable, and it would detract from the symbolism of the act. </body></html>
