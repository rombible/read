We accept you as one. Where is the other? He should be present before us if his evidence is to be accepted.” They must have known well from the earlier discourse that He claimed God as His Father, and the recurring phrase, “the Father that sent Me,” must have now made this clear. We are not to read in these words, then, any reference to a father in the flesh, though this interpretation is that of many ancient and modern expositors. The question, moreover, is not, “Who is Thy Father?” but “Where is Thy Father?” The question is asked in another spirit in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-8.htm" title="Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.">John 14:8</a>.<p>It may be that to their scorn is added the desire to draw from Him express words on which to base an accusation. They perhaps expect an answer such as “My Father who is in heaven.” (Comp. the direct question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-24.htm" title="Then came the Jews round about him, and said to him, How long do you make us to doubt?

But the time has not yet come. His answer contains no words which they could lay hold of as a technical ground for blasphemy.<p><span class= "bld">Ye neither know me, nor my Father.</span>—He traces their ignorance of the Father to its true cause, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to their neglect of the only means by which God could be known.

Those become vain in their imaginations concerning God, who will not learn of Christ. Those who know not his glory and grace, know not the Father that sent him. The time of our departure out of the world, depends upon God. Our enemies cannot hasten it any sooner, nor can our friends delay it any longer, than the time appointed of the Father. Every true believer can look up and say with pleasure, My times are in thy hand, and better there than in my own.

Jesus had often given them to understand that by his Father he meant God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-6.htm">John 5:6</a>; They professed to be ignorant of this, and probably looked round in contempt for his Father, that he might adduce him as a witness in the case.<p>If ye had known me ... - If you had listened to my instructions, and had received me as the Messiah, you would also, at the same time, have been acquainted with God. We may here observe,<p>1. The manner in which Jesus answered them. He gave no heed to their cavil; he was not irritated by their contempt; he preserved his dignity, and gave them an answer worthy of the Son of God.<p>2. We should meet the cavils and sneers of sinners in the same manner. We should not render railing for railing, but "in meekness instruct those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-25.htm">2 Timothy 2:25</a>.<p>3. The way to know God is to know Jesus Christ. "No man hath seen God at any time. The only-begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him," <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>.

We know no father which thou hast but the carpenter, Joseph; we do not look upon him as so credible a witness in the case, as to take his testimony in such a matter as this is. Christ tells them, that the reason why they did not know the Father, was because they did not know and acknowledge, receive and believe him; for if they had received and believed him, they would not then have been at such a loss to have known where his Father was, or who he was. The eternal Father is not to be known but in, and by, and through the Son. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said they unto him, where is thy Father?.... The Persic version adds, "show him unto us": produce this witness boasted of, let us see him; this they said in a sneering, taunting, and insulting manner; where is thy Father? what! he is in Galilee; fetch him from thence; it is Joseph the carpenter you mean; a goodly witness indeed! <p>Jesus answered, ye neither know me nor my Father; if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also; they did not know the divine original of Christ, that he was the Son of God, and that God was his Father; they greatly boasted of their knowledge of God, but they knew him not; their ignorance of Christ showed it: the knowledge of both go together, and which is life eternal; nor can any truly know the one, without the other: and where the one is known, the other will be also; Christ is the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person: so that he that has seen the one, must know the other; and indeed, no one can know the Father, but he to whom the Son reveals him: this was a severe mortification to these men of knowledge. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father?

The question of the Pharisees, who only pretend not to understand what Jesus means by the words <span class="greekheb">ὁ πέμψας με πατήρ</span>, between which and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-27.htm" title="They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.">John 8:27</a> there is no inconsistency, is <span class="ital">frivolous mockery</span>. “Where is, then, this second witness, thy Father?” He has no actual existence! He ought, surely, to be here on the spot, if, as thou hast said, He were a witness with thee on thy behalf! To regard their question as the expression of a <span class="ital">veritable material apprehension</span> on their part, that He referred to a <span class="ital">physical father</span> (Augustine, Bede, and several; also De Wette, Olshausen, Brückner, and, doubtfully, Lücke), some also having found in it a blasphemous allusion to bastardy (Cyril, Ammon), is irreconcilable with the circumstance that Jesus had already so frequently and unmistakeably pointed to <span class="ital">God</span> as His Father; the questioners themselves also betray their dissimulation by the word <span class="greekheb">ποῦ</span>; they do not ask <span class="greekheb">τίς</span>. Totally different is the relation of the question put by Philip in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-8.htm" title="Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.">John 14:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">reply</span> of Jesus unveils to them with clear composure whence it arose that they put so wicked a question.

For He shows the perversity of their interrogation, and teaches them, that they must first know the Son, whom they see and hear in the flesh, if they wish to know the Father.

"Thou hast freed thyself from the charge of bearing unsupported testimony to thyself, by assuming the coordinate testimony of thy Father? Let thy Father manifest himself!" There is no need to explain this of the absence or insignificance of the earthly father of Jesus, or to suppose that they looked for some human attestation of such a kind (Augustine, Lange). They rather scoffed at his claim of unique relation to the Father, and asked with mockery," <span class="accented">Where is</span> he?" not "<span class="accented">Who</span> or <span class="accented">what</span> is he?" What proof has he given of any special relation to thee? <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered</span> this taunt with sublime patience and pity, with distress at the resolute and judicial blindness they were fastening upon themselves: <span class="cmt_word">Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.</span> Another stupendous utterance, implying the most intimate relation between his own personality and the Father's. Any fair or adequate knowledge of himself must reveal to them that he is in the Father and the Father in him; must bring forth to their consciences the overshadowing presence, the Divine glory. "You are wrapping yourself in impenetrable mists; you are refusing the light of life, and all the evidence given to you that I am the Light of the world. You do not see less recondite truths, nor perceive ideas far more elementary still; you cannot, in your spiritual blindness, apprehend the outline of my human character. If you had done this, you would have known my Father at least enough to prevent the utterance of so crude and disheartening a query. You know me not: why should I talk to you? All this ministry of mine has left me, so far as you Pharisees are concerned, perfectly unknown." There is awful severity and unutterable pathos in these closing words of the discourse. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Where<p>The testimony of an unseen and unheard witness would not satisfy them. </body></html>
