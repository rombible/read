The answer is that Abraham, like all men, came into being. There was a time when he was not. But there was never a time when the Son of God was not. In the time before Abraham, in the eternity before time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>), He still was. No word which expresses becoming can be used of His existence.

Men may be able to dispute about God, yet may not know him. Such as know not God, and obey not the gospel of Christ, are put together, 2Th 1:8. All who rightly know anything of Christ, earnestly desire to know more of him. Those who discern the dawn of the light of the Sun of Righteousness, wish to see his rising. Before Abraham was, I AM. This speaks Abraham a creature, and our Lord the Creator; well, therefore, might he make himself greater than Abraham. I AM, is the name of God, Ex 3:14; it speaks his self-existence; he is the First and the Last, ever the same, Re 1:8. Thus he was not only before Abraham, but before all worlds, Pr 8:23; Joh 1:1. As Mediator, he was the appointed Messiah, long before Abraham; the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, Re 13:8. The Lord Jesus was made of God Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption, to Adam, and Abel, and all that lived and died by faith in him, before Abraham. The Jews were about to stone Jesus for blasphemy, but he withdrew; by his miraculous power he passed through them unhurt. Let us stedfastly profess what we know and believe concerning God; and if heirs of Abraham's faith, we shall rejoice in looking forward to that day when the Saviour shall appear in glory, to the confusion of his enemies, and to complete the salvation of all who believe in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Verily, verily - This is an expression used only in John. It is a strong affirmation denoting particularly the great importance of what was about to be affirmed. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>.<p>Before Abraham was - Before Abraham lived.<p>I am - The expression I am, though in the present tense, is clearly designed to refer to a past time. Thus, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, "From everlasting to everlasting thou art God." Applied to God, it denotes continued existence without respect to time, so far as he is concerned. We divide time into the past, the present, and the future. The expression, applied to God, denotes that he does not measure his existence in this manner, but that the word by which we express the present denotes his continued and unchanging existence. Hence, he assumes it as his name, "I AM," and "I AM that I AM," <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-6.htm">Isaiah 44:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a>. There is a remarkable similarity between the expression employed by Jesus in this place and that used in Exodus to denote the name of God. The manner in which Jesus used it would strikingly suggest the application of the same language to God. The question here was about his pre-existence. The objection of the Jews was that he was not 50 years old, and could not, therefore, have seen Abraham. Jesus replied to that that he existed before Abraham. As in his human nature he was not yet 50 years old, and could not, as a man, have existed before Abraham, this declaration must be referred to another nature; and the passage proves that, while he was a man, he was also endowed with another nature existing before Abraham, and to which he applied the term (familiar to the Jews as expressive of the existence of God) I AM; and this declaration corresponds to the affirmation of John Joh 1:1, that he was in the beginning with God, and was God. This affirmation of Jesus is one of the proofs on which John relies to prove that he was the Messiah <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-31.htm">John 20:31</a>, to establish which was the design of writing this book. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>58. Before Abraham was, I am&#8212;The words rendered "was" and "am" are quite different. The one clause means, "Abraham was brought into being"; the other, "I exist." The statement therefore is not that Christ came into existence before Abraham did (as Arians affirm is the meaning), but that He never came into being at all, but existed before Abraham had a being; in other words, existed before creation, or eternally (as Joh 1:1). In that sense the Jews plainly understood Him, since "then took they up stones to cast at Him," just as they had before done when they saw that He made Himself equal with God (Joh 5:18).<p>hid himself&#8212;(See on [1814]Lu 4:30).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some will have the meaning to be, that Christ was before Abraham’s time constituted Mediator; as he is said to be <span class="ital">the Lamb</span> <span class="ital">slain from the foundation of the world, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-8.htm" title="And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.">Revelation 13:8</a></span>: so <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm" title="Who truly was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,">1 Peter 1:20</a></span>. But thus it might have been said of any of the elect, that they were chosen before Abraham was. It is therefore undoubtedly to be understood of Christ’s eternal existence, as to his Divine nature; and this will appear, as from other arguments, so from the whole scope of our Saviour’s former discourse in this chapter, which was to assert his Divine nature and equality with the Father. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus said unto them, verily, verily, I say unto you,.... Whether it will be believed or not, it is certainly fact: <p>before Abraham was, I am; which is to be understood, not of his being in the purpose and decree of God, foreordained to sufferings, and to glory; for so all the elect of God may be said to be before Abraham, being chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world: or that Christ was man, before Abraham became the father of many nations; that is, before the calling of the Gentiles; for nothing is said in the text about his being the father of many nations; it is a bold and impudent addition to it: and besides, Abraham was made the father of many nations, as Ishmaelites, Israelites, Hagarenes, &amp;c. long before the incarnation of Christ; yea, he was so from the very promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5</a>, which so runs, "a father of many nations have I made thee"; so that this appears a false sense of the text, which is to be understood of the deity, eternity, and immutability of Christ, and refers to the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>. "I am that I-am--I am hath sent me unto you", the true Jehovah; and so Christ was before Abraham was in being, the everlasting I am, the eternal God, which is, and was, and is to come: he appeared in an human form to our first parents before Abraham was, and was manifested as the Mediator, Saviour, and living Redeemer, to whom all the patriarchs before Abraham looked, and by whom they were saved: he was concerned in the creation of all things out of nothing, as the efficient cause thereof; he was set up from everlasting as Mediator; and the covenant of grace was made with him, and the blessings and promises of it were put into his hands before the world began; the eternal election of men to everlasting life was made in him before the foundation of the world; and he had a glory with his Father before the world was; yea, from all eternity he was the Son of God, of the same nature with him, and equal to him; and his being of the same nature proves his eternity, as well as deity, that he is from everlasting to everlasting God; and is what he ever was, and will be what he now is: he is immutable, the same today, yesterday, and for ever; in his nature, love, grace, and fulness, he is the invariable and unchangeable I am. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I <span class="cverse3">{y}</span> am.</span><p>(y) Christ, as he was God, was before Abraham: and he was the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>.

Artemonius, with Socinus, thus explains the words; Before that Abraham is made the father of many nations, I am, to wit, the Christ: and also he takes I am in the same sense as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-24.htm" title="I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.">John 8:24</a>, “If ye believe not that I am He;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>, “Then shall ye know that I am He;” ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-19.htm" title="Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, you may believe that I am he.">John 13:19</a>, “That, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am He;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-6.htm" title="For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.">Mark 13:6</a>, “Many shall come saying, I am (Christ).” I reply, 1) The Jews had objected that Abraham was deceased for more than fifty years before; Abraham was not regarded by them as about to belong to the New Testament. 2) This sentiment would not have borne that most solemn asseveration, Verily, verily, I say unto you. For in this sense even the Jews, who were then living, would have been before Abraham. 3) The word I am, in this colloquy, is employed concerning age and time, in antithesis to the inchoative to be brought into being [<span class="greekheb">γενέσθαι</span>]. Moreover, the reference of the words opposed is the same, and both verbs ought to be understood absolutely, as was is used; ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>, “In the beginning was the Word,” etc. However this absolute signification includes that other by consequence; before that Abraham was brought into being; He who speaks, was; and He was the same as He asserted to the Jews that He was.—<span class="greekheb">πρἰν Ἀβραάμ γενέσθαι</span>) <span class="greekheb">Γενέσθαι</span> is wanting in some of the old fathers, especially the Latin fathers; but the use of the adverb <span class="greekheb">πρίν</span> does not bear the omission. That indeed is certain, that those fathers had no thought of the Socinian perversion of the sense of the verb <span class="greekheb">γενέσθαι</span>, and so the perversion of this whole passage. [Dabc and Epiphanius omit <span class="greekheb">γενέσθαι</span>.

He gives the solemn emphasis of the <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> once more - <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born</span> (came into being), <span class="cmt_word">I am.</span> Abraham came into existence by birth (the Vulgate translates, <span class="accented">Antequam fierat Abraham Ego sum</span>): <span class="accented">I am.</span> Numerous attempts have been made to explain this climacteric utterance on some humanistic theory. The contrast is very remarkable between <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. Jesus Christ declared his own timeless existence to have been in his consciousness before Abraham came into being at all. The "I am" reminds us repeatedly, when used by Jesus, of the "I AM THAT I AM" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, and the "thou art" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>. (89:2, LXX.); Psalms 102:28. His human consciousness gave utterance to the awful depths of the eternal Ego. Now, some critics have limited it in its meaning to "I existed in the counsel of God." But there are three objections to this interpretation: one is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the present tense, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;</span>, and not the past, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, was used by our Lord; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> on this interpretation Abraham must have also equally pre-existed in the counsel of God; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> such a statement would throw no light on the previous discourse. The Racovian Confession of Faith, based on the view of Socinus, explains, "Before Abram becomes Abraham, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the father of many nations, I am it, the Messiah, the Light of the world." Not until my Messianic claims are acknowledged, and the many nations become children of Abraham, does Abraham really become Abraham, does his name derive its full meaning. This would be rabbinical trifling (J.P. Smith, 'Script. Test. to Messiah,' vol. 2). Beyschlag thinks that our Lord realized in his Person not a conscious pre-existence before Abraham, or before all worlds, but an impersonal principle, the image of God, which could only "be" in the eternal mind of God. There is a sense in which every man may realize such pre-existence as this, not merely "the Son of God," nor the new man in Christ, but every man whatsoever; but such a statement is entirely out of harmony with the whole passage that precedes. If the Jews had understood it in this sense, they would not have taken up stores to stone him, but, after their wont, would have said, "So also were we." "Ideas do not see one another." The first <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;</span> (ver. 12) brought out their angry unbelief, but this excites their murderous assault. We have to observe that this remarkable expression does not stand alone. St. John had reasons for saying "that the Word was with God, and was God. and was made flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 3, 14</a>). If Jesus, in his Divine consciousness, had never elsewhere spoken of having had a <span class="accented">being</span> before his <span class="accented">manifestation</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-46.htm">John 6:46, 62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>), of having taken part with the Father from the beginning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>), of being "one with the Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30, 33</a>), of being greater than the temple or the sabbath, as being the Object of the eternal love in coming down from heaven, in laying down his life that he might take it again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17, 18</a>); and if the language of the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>) had not entirely prepared our mind for the data on which such conclusions rested, a generation before this Gospel was reduced to form, we might join the effort to resist such a claim as that of eternal pre-existence. But the whole tenor of the Gospel and the entire New Testament teaching are seen, more and more, to turn upon this fundamental position - that in Christ dwells all the fulness of the Godhead, that he had life in himself, and eternity, and that the manhood has not only been lifted to the highest place in human remembrance, but to the midst of the throne. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Was, I am (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;)<p>It is important to observe the distinction between the two verbs. Abraham's life was under the conditions of time, and therefore had a temporal beginning. Hence, Abraham came into being, or was born (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;). Jesus' life was from and to eternity. Hence the formula for absolute, timeless existence, I am (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#769; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;).
