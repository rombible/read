Those are self-condemned who judge others, and yet do the same thing. All who are any way called to blame the faults of others, are especially concerned to look to themselves, and keep themselves pure. In this matter Christ attended to the great work about which he came into the world, that was, to bring sinners to repentance; not to destroy, but to save. He aimed to bring, not only the accused to repentance, by showing her his mercy, but the prosecutors also, by showing them their sins; they thought to insnare him, he sought to convince and convert them. He declined to meddle with the magistrate's office. Many crimes merit far more severe punishment than they meet with; but we should not leave our own work, to take that upon ourselves to which we are not called. When Christ sent her away, it was with this caution, Go, and sin no more. Those who help to save the life of a criminal, should help to save the soul with the same caution. Those are truly happy, whom Christ does not condemn. Christ's favour to us in the forgiveness of past sins should prevail with us, Go then, and sin no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mount of Olives - The mountain about a mile directly east of Jerusalem.

The woman here taken must therefore necessarily be regarded as <span class="ital">such an one</span>, because the <span class="greekheb">λιθοβολεῖσθαι</span> is <span class="ital">expressly referred to a command contained in the Mosaic law</span>. From Deut. <span class="ital">l.c</span>., where the betrothed, in reference to the seducer, is termed <span class="greekheb">אֵשֶׁת רֵעֵהוּ</span>, it is clear that the crime in question was regarded as a modified form of adultery, as it is also called <span class="greekheb">εἶδος μοιχεῖας</span> by Philo, de legg. special. ii. p. 311. The rarity of such a case as this made it all the more a fit topic for a tempting question in casuistry. Accordingly, <span class="greekheb">τὰς τοιαύτας</span> is to be understood as denoting the class of adulteresses of this particular kind, to whom refers that law of Moses appointing the punishment of stoning: “adulteresses of this kind.” That Moses, in Deut. l.c., does not use the expression <span class="greekheb">נאף</span> (Lücke’s objection) is immaterial, because he has not this word at all in the connection, nor even in the other cases, but designates the thing in another way. Usually the woman is regarded as a married woman; and as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm" title="And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 20:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm" title="If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shall you put away evil from Israel.">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>, not stoning specifically, but death generally is the punishment adjudged to adulteresses of this class, some either infer the internal falsehood of the whole story (Wetstein, Semler, Morus, Paulus, Lücke, De Wette, Baur, and many others; comp. also Hengstenberg and Godet), or assume that the punishment of death, which is not more precisely defined by the law (“to die the death”), must mean stoning (Michaelis, Mos. R. § 262; Tholuck, B. Crusius, Ebrard, Keil, Archæol. § 153, 1; Ewald, Brückner hesitatingly, Luthardt, Baeumlein). As to the last view, judging from the text in Deut. l.c., and also according to Rabbinical tradition, it is certainly an unsafe assumption; comp. Saalschütz, Mos. R. p. 571. Here, however, where the <span class="greekheb">λιθοβολεῖσθαι</span> is distinctly cited as a positive provision of the law, we have neither reason nor right to assume a reference to any other precept save that in which stoning is expressly named as the punishment, viz. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-24.htm" title="Then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife: so you shall put away evil from among you.">Deuteronomy 22:24</a> (LXX.: <span class="greekheb">λιθοβολήσονται ἐν λίθοις</span>), with which also the Talmud agrees, Sanhedr. f. 51, 2 : “Filia Israelitae, si adultera, cum nupta, strangulanda,[2] cum <span class="ital">desponsata, lapidanda</span>.” The supposition of Grotius, that the severer punishment of stoning for adultery was introduced after the time of Ezekiel, cannot be proved by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-38.htm" title="And I will judge you, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give you blood in fury and jealousy.">Ezekiel 16:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-40.htm" title="They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.">Ezekiel 16:40</a>; Sus. 45; the <span class="greekheb">Μωϋσῆς ἐνετείλατο</span>, moreover, is decidedly against all such suppositions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2] According to the Talmudic rule: “Omnis mors, cujus et mentio in lege simpliciter, non alia est quam strangulatio,” <span class="ital">Sanhedr. l.c.</span> The incorrectness of this rule (Michaelis, <span class="ital">l.c.</span>) is a matter of no consequence, so far as the present passage is concerned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-4.htm" title="They say to him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.">John 8:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διδάσκαλε</span>, <span class="ital">teacher</span> [Master]) The reason [is implied in the title by which they address Him], why they require Him to give His decision.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπαυτοφώρῳ</span>, <span class="ital">in the very act</span>) Such scandalous acts are frequently perpetrated about the time of <span class="ital">feasts</span>.
