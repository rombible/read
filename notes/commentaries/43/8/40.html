(Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-37.htm" title="I know that you are Abraham's seed; but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.">John 8:37</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard </span>(better, <span class= "ital">which I heard</span>) <span class= "bld">from God.</span>—The term “a man,” expresses His revelation, by means of human form, of the divine truth which He heard in the pre-human state (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-38.htm" title="I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.">John 8:38</a>). The crime of seeking to kill Him is aggravated by the fact that He was One who came to tell them truth, and that from God. They seek to destroy the human life which for the sake of humanity He has assumed.<p><span class= "bld">This did not Abraham.</span>—It is usual to explain these words by a reference to Abraham’s receptivity of the divine truth and messengers (see Genesis 12; Genesis 14; Genesis 18; Genesis 22); but they probably point to the whole course of the patriarchal life as directly opposed to the spirit of those who claim to be his children.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:37-40 Our Lord opposed the proud and vain confidence of these Jews, showing that their descent from Abraham could not profit those of a contrary spirit to him. Where the word of God has no place, no good is to be expected; room is left there for all wickedness. A sick person who turns from his physician, and will take neither remedies nor food, is past hope of recovery. The truth both heals and nourishes the hearts of those who receive it. The truth taught by philosophers has not this power and effect, but only the truth of God. Those who claim the privileges of Abraham, must do Abraham's works; must be strangers and sojourners in this world; keep up the worship of God in their families, and always walk before God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye seek to kill me - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-37.htm">John 8:37</a>.<p>This did not Abraham - Or such things Abraham did not do. There are two things noted here in which they differed from Abraham:<p>1. In seeking to kill him, or in possessing a murderous and bloody purpose.<p>2. In rejecting the truth as God revealed it. Abraham was distinguished for love to man as well as God. He liberated the captives <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14-16</a>; was distinguished for hospitality to strangers <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1-8</a>; and received the revelations of God to him, however mysterious, or however trying their observance, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-4.htm">Genesis 15:4-6</a>; 22. It was for these things that he is so much commended in the New Testament <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-9.htm">Romans 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-9.htm">Romans 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-6.htm">Galatians 3:6</a>; and, as the Jews sought to kill Jesus instead of treating him hospitably and kindly, they showed that they had none of the spirit of Abraham. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40. this did not Abraham&#8212;In so doing ye act in direct opposition to him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> You declare by your actions that you are very far from the spirit and temper of Abraham: I am one who, being sent of God, whom you own as your Father, have faithfully revealed the will of God to you, and have never told you any thing but the truth; and this is all my crime, for which you seek to murder me: this was none of your father Abraham’s practice; so as though you have something of Abraham’s blood, yet you have nothing of Abraham’s spirit in you. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But now ye seek to kill me,.... A temper and disposition very foreign from that of Abraham's: <p>a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God; to seek to kill a man is a very great crime, and punishable with death; to kill an innocent one, that had done no sin, who was pure, holy, harmless, and inoffensive to God and man, was an aggravation of the iniquity; and to kill a prophet, and one more than a prophet, who brought a revelation from God himself, and declared the whole truth of the Gospel, and particularly that of his divine, eternal sonship, which incensed them against him, and put them upon seeking to take away his life, still increased the sin. <p>This did not Abraham: the sense is not, that Abraham did not tell the truth he had heard of God; for he did instruct, and command his children after him, to walk in the ways of the Lord, which he had learned from him; but that Abraham did not reject any truth that was revealed unto him, and much less seek to take away the life of any person that brought it to him; and indeed not the life of any man that deserved not to die: and our Lord suggests, that if he had been on the spot now, he would not have done as these his posterity did, since he saw his day by faith, and rejoiced in the foresight of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>. The Jew (o) makes an objection from these words against the deity of Christ; <p>"you see (says he) that Jesus declares concerning himself that he is not God, but man; and so says Paul concerning him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>; and so Jesus, in many places, calls himself the son of man: for do we find in any place that he calls himself God, as the Nazarenes believe.'' <p>To which may be replied, that Jesus does not declare in these words, nor in any other place, that he is not God; he says no such thing; he only observes, that he was a man, as he really was: nor is his being man any contradiction to his being God; for he is both God and man; and so those that believe in him affirm: and though Christ does not in express terms call himself God, yet he owned himself to be the Son of God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-61.htm">Mark 14:61</a>, and said such things of himself, as manifestly declared him to be God; and upon account of which the Jews concluded, that he not only made himself equal with God, but that he made himself God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>. Besides, he suffered himself to be called God by a disciple of his, which he would never have done, had he not been really and truly God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>; yea, he seems to call himself so, when being tempted by Satan, he observed to him what is written, "thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God", <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-7.htm">Matthew 4:7</a>. The reason why he so often calls himself the son of man is, because it was more suitable to him in his state of humiliation; and indeed, there was no need for him to assert his deity in express words, since his works and miracles most clearly proved that he was God: and as for the Apostle Paul, though he sometimes speaks of him as a man, he also says of him, that he is God over all, blessed for ever; and calls him the great God, and our Saviour, and God manifest in the flesh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>. <p>(o) R.

The excitement produced by this bold charge among his own true disciples, and those who now for the first time heard of it, by our Lord's then and there lifting the veil from many a specious question; the look of guilt on the countenances of some, of truculent admission of the charge in the gesture of others; the loud murmurs and confused cries of the crowd, - must all be realized to apprehend the tremendous crisis which had now arrived. He aggravated the charge by describing himself as <span class="cmt_word">a man who hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">declared to you the truth which I heard from God.</span> This is the only place where the Lord speaks of himself as "<span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">man"</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). He here describes himself as One who is subject and liable to their murderous passion - <span class="accented">a man</span>, seeing that his eternal Personality has been presented to his antagonists in the form of man. His manhood was the link of relation between the God who sent him, taught him, surrounded and enveloped him, and the consciousness of his hearers. This is the highest representation of the very conception of a Divine commission and a Divine message. They were seeking to stamp out a Divine fire, to drown a heavenly voice, to refuse and trample upon a sacred Messenger. <span class="cmt_word">This did not Abraham.</span> The father of the faithful was susceptible to the heavenly voice, he heard and obeyed the voice of Jehovah with childlike docility (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12, 14, 18, 22</a>.). The visions, the commands, the messengers, the manifestations, of God to Abraham were so readily accepted that his faith is a proverb, and his greatest name is "friend of God." The wilful, hurried, malicious treatment of both the Divine Messenger and the sacred message, both of which Jesus declared to have come directly from God, proves the lack of relation with the Life of Abraham. They might be Abraham's "seed" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) but not his (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) children, and he in this sense could not be their "father." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A man (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Used only here by the Lord of Himself.
