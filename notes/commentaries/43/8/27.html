Jesus answered, You neither know me, nor my Father: if you had known me, you should have known my Father also.">John 8:19</a>. Still the speakers then, and those spoken of now, are “the Jews” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-13.htm" title="The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bore record of yourself; your record is not true.">John 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-22.htm" title="Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he said, Where I go, you cannot come.">John 8:22</a>); and they are probably in part identical with those of whom our Lord tells us there, that they knew neither Him nor the Father. Of these men St. John tells us now that they did not know that the Sender and the Father are one. The statement of their want of perception, which strikes us as so marvellous, is made just because it was marvellous. St. John remembers it many years afterwards, and remembers that on account of it Jesus proceeded to declare more fully that every act He did was done in the Father, and that every word He spoke was taught by the Father, and that in every event of His life the Father was present.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:21-29 Those that live in unbelief, are for ever undone, if they die in unbelief. The Jews belonged to this present evil world, but Jesus was of a heavenly and Divine nature, so that his doctrine, kingdom, and blessings, would not suit their taste. But the curse of the law is done away to all that submit to the grace of the gospel. Nothing but the doctrine of Christ's grace will be an argument powerful enough, and none but the Spirit of Christ's grace will be an agent powerful enough, to turn us from sin to God; and that Spirit is given, and that doctrine is given, to work upon those only who believe in Christ. Some say, Who is this Jesus? They allow him to have been a Prophet, an excellent Teacher, and even more than a creature; but cannot acknowledge him as over all, God blessed for evermore. Will not this suffice? Jesus here answers the question. Is this to honour him as the Father? Does this admit his being the Light of the world, and the Life of men, one with the Father? All shall know by their conversion, or in their condemnation, that he always spake and did what pleased the Father, even when he claimed the highest honours to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They understood not - They knew not, or they were unwilling to receive him as a messenger from God.

But the surprising, nay more, the very improbable element (De Wette) which has been found in this non-understanding, disappears when it is remembered that at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus again to them, I go my way, and you shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I go, you cannot come.">John 8:21</a> a <span class="ital">new</span> section of the discourse commenced, and that we are not obliged to suppose that precisely the same hearers were present in both cases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-16.htm" title="And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me....">John 8:16-17</a>). The less, therefore, is it allowable to convert non-understanding into the idea of <span class="ital">non-recognition</span> (Lücke); or to regard it as equivalent to <span class="ital">obduracy</span> (Tholuck, Brückner); or to explain <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> as <span class="ital">in which sense</span> (Hofmann, <span class="ital">l.c.</span> p. 180); or with Luthardt, to press <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῖς</span>, and to give as the meaning of the simple words: “that in bearing witness to Himself He bears witness <span class="ital">to them</span> that the God who sends Him <span class="ital">is the Father;</span>” or with Ebrard, to find in <span class="greekheb">ἔλεγεν</span>: “<span class="ital">that it is His vocation</span>” to proclaim to them; or, with Hengstenberg, to understand <span class="greekheb">ἔγνωσαν</span>, etc., of the <span class="ital">true knowledge</span>, namely, of the <span class="ital">deity of Christ</span>. For such interpretations as these there is no foundation in the passage; it simply denotes: they knew not (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>) that in these words (<span class="greekheb">ὁ πέμψας με</span>, etc.) He spoke to them of the Father.

But the meaning of the words is quite unambiguous, and is not incredible. We have seen that there is an interval, possibly of days, between <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-20.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.">John 8:20</a></span> and <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus again to them, I go my way, and you shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: where I go, you cannot come.">John 8:21</a></span>. The audience may have changed very considerably; but if not, experience shews that the ignorance and stupidity of unbelief are sometimes almost unbounded. Still we may admit that the dulness exhibited here is extraordinary; and it is precisely because it is so extraordinary that St John records it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-27.htm" title="They understood not that he spoke to them of the Father.">John 8:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐκ ἔγνωσαν</span>, <span class="ital">they understood not</span>) By means of this epicrisis [explanatory addition] John intimates his astonishment at the unbelief and blindness of the Jews; as at ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-37.htm" title="But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:">John 12:37</a>, “But though He had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on Him.”—<span class="greekheb">τὸν τατέρα</span>, <span class="ital">the Father</span>) the Father <span class="ital">had sent</span> Him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-26.htm" title="I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.">John 8:26</a> : and had they known the Father, they would have known <span class="ital">who</span> Jesus was, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-25.htm" title="Then said they to him, Who are you?

This difficult parenthesis of the evangelist calls attention to the fact that, during the immediately preceding discourse and controversy, Jesus had dropped his references to the Father, and had used the periphrasis, "he that sent me," probably suggesting to this strangely excited populace, fed with weird fancies and wild expectations, that the mysterious Being with whom they were conversing was but the Delegate of One mightier than he, who was hidden in the secret place of God's providence until the hour of his own manifestation should appear to have struck. They might have remembered the utter deference which the great prophet John had displayed before a Messiah whom as yet they knew not. They may have heard that even John himself, at a later date, sent from the prison two of his disciples to propound the query, "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?" in other words, "Art thou the final Manifestation of all that I have predicted and believed? or is <span class="accented">another</span> to make his appearance with fire and axe and available force to compel obedience and to secure universal homage?" It is more than probable that the evangelist, being personally alive to the cross currents of passion, enthusiasm, and hostility which were at work in the hearts of the populace, saw by the very blankness and confusion on their faces, and the "asides" of the multitude, that they had not perceived that Jesus was throughout in these references speaking of <span class="accented">the Father of all</span> - the supreme Source of all power, the Lord of hosts. Even when he had said, "Ye have not known me, nor my Father," they had not risen to such a conception of the Lord's meaning as to suppose that the supreme Father himself was being suggested to them and cited as the corroborative Witness, as the supernatural Aid and Divine Presence which was giving validity to all that Christ has said about himself. Their ignorance and lack of perception need not astonish us when we reflect upon the obscurity and non-receptivity of the apostles themselves, and the like obtuseness of theologians and cultivated men of the world in every age from that day to this. The remark is, moreover, added doubtless to interpret the following verses, in which the ideas of ver. 26 are repeated, with the difference that, whereas he had already spoken of him that sent him, and who had authorized his words and judgments, Jesus now gives to him the beloved name of "the Father." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>They understood (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Perceived, as Rev.<p>He spake<p>Imperfect.
