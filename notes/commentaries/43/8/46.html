The special lusts of the devil are spiritual wickedness, the lusts of the mind, and corrupt reasonings, pride and envy, wrath and malice, enmity to good, and enticing others to evil.

Groundlessness of this unbelief. <span class="greekheb">Εἰ μὴ</span>, <span class="greekheb">διότι τὴν ἀλήθειαν λέγω</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀπιστεῖτέ μοι</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἴπατε</span>, <span class="greekheb">τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐλέγχει με περὶ ἁμαρτίας ὑπʼ ἐμοῦ γενομένης</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα δόξητε διʼ ἐκείνην ἀπιστεῖν</span>; Euth. Zigabenus. <span class="greekheb">Ἁμαρτία</span>, <span class="ital">fault</span>, is not to be taken in the intellectual sense, as <span class="ital">untruth, error</span> (Origen, Cyril, Melancthon, Calvin, Beza, Bengel, Kypke, Tittmann, Kuinoel, Klee, and others), but, as it is employed without exception in the N. T., namely as equivalent to <span class="ital">sin</span>. Jesus boldly urges against His opponents His unassailable moral purity—and how lofty a position of superiority does He thus assume above the saints of the Old Testament!—the fact that against Him can be brought <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίας ὄνειδος οὐδὲν</span> (Soph. <span class="ital">O. C</span>. 971), as a guarantee that He speaks the truth; justly too, for according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a> <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> must be regarded as the opposite of <span class="greekheb">ψεῦδος</span>, whereas a lie falls under the category of <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> (comp. <span class="greekheb">ἀδικία</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-18.htm" title="He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.">John 7:18</a>). The conclusion is from the genus to the species; hence also it is inadmissible to take <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span> in the special sense of “<span class="ital">fraus</span>” (“qua divinam veritatem in mendacium converterim,” Ch. F. Fritzsche in Fritzsch. <span class="ital">Opusc</span>. p. 99), “<span class="ital">wicked deception</span>” (B. Crusius), “<span class="ital">sin of word</span>” (Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 33 f.), “<span class="ital">false doctrine</span>” (Melancthon, Calvin), and so forth. Even in classical usage <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτία</span>, in and by itself, would denote neither <span class="ital">error</span> nor <span class="ital">deception</span>, but only acquire this specific meaning through an addition more precisely determining its force.[34] Considered in itself it denotes <span class="ital">fault, perversity</span>, the opposite of <span class="greekheb">ὀρθότης</span> (Plat. <span class="ital">Legg</span>. i. p. 627 D, ii. p. 668 C). Comp. <span class="greekheb">δόξης ἁμαρτία</span>, Thuc. i. 32. 4; <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΌΜΩΝ ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑ</span></span></span>, Plat. <span class="ital">Legg</span>. i. p. 627 D; <span class="greekheb">γνώμης ἁμάρτημα</span>, Thuc. ii. 65. 7. Remark further, in connection with this important passage: (1) The argument is based, not upon the position that “<span class="ital">the sinless one is the purest and surest organ of the knowledge and communication of the truth</span>” (Lücke); or that “<span class="ital">the knowledge of the truth is grounded in the purity of the will</span>” (De Wette, comp. Ullmann); for this would presuppose in the consciousness in which the words are spoken, to wit, in the consciousness of Jesus, a knowledge of the truth obtained <span class="ital">mediately</span>, or, at all events, acquired first in His <span class="ital">human</span> state; whereas, on the contrary, especially according to John’s view, the knowledge of the truth possessed by Jesus was an <span class="ital">intuitive</span> one, one possessed by Him in His <span class="ital">pre-human</span> state, and preserved and continued during His human state by means of the constant intercourse between Himself and God. The reasoning proceeds rather in this way: Am I really without <span class="ital">sin</span>,—and none of you is able to convict me of the contrary,—then am I also without <span class="greekheb">ψεῦδος</span>; but am I without <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΨΕῦΔΟς</span></span></span>, then do I speak the <span class="ital">truth</span>, and you, on your part (<span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>), have no reason for not believing me. This reasoning, however, is abbreviated, in that Jesus passes at once from the denial of the possibility of charging Him with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑ</span></span></span>, to the positive, special contrary which follows therefrom,—leaving out the middle link, that consequently no <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΨΕῦΔΟς</span></span></span> can be attributed to Him,—and then continues: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸ ἈΛΉΘ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΛΈΓΩ</span></span></span> (Lachmann and Tischendorf correctly without <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΈ</span></span></span>). <span class="ital">Further</span>, (2) the proof of the sinlessness of Jesus furnished by this passage is purely <span class="ital">subjective</span>, so far as it rests on the decided expression of His own moral consciousness in the presence of His enemies; but, at the same time, it is as such all the more striking in that the confirmation of His own testimony (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a>) is added to the testimony of <span class="ital">others</span>, and to the <span class="ital">necessity</span> of His sinlessness for the work of redemption and for the function of judge. This self-witness of Jesus, on the one hand, bears on itself the seal of immediate truth (otherwise, namely, Jesus would have been chargeable with a <span class="greekheb">καυχᾶθαι</span> of self-righteousness or self-deception, which is inconceivable in Him); whilst, on the other hand, it is saved from the weakness attaching to other self-witnessings, both by the whole evangelical history, and by the fact of the work of reconciliation. (3) The sinlessness itself, to which Jesus here lays claim, is in so far <span class="ital">relative</span>, as it is not absolutely divine, but both is and must be <span class="ital">divine-human</span>, and was based on the human development of the Son of God.[35] He was actually <span class="ital">tempted</span>, and <span class="ital">might have</span> sinned; this abstract possibility, however, never became a reality. On the contrary, at every moment of His life it was raised into a practical impossibility.[36] Thus He <span class="ital">learned</span> obedience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>). Hence the sinlessness of Jesus, being the result of a normal development which, at every stage of His earthly existence, was in perfect conformity with the God-united ground of His inner life (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm" title="And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was on him.">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-52.htm" title="And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.">Luke 2:52</a>), must always be regarded as conditioned, so far as the human manifestation of Jesus is concerned, by the entrance of the Logos into the relation of growth; whilst the unconditioned correlate thereto, namely, <span class="ital">perfection</span>, and accordingly <span class="ital">absolute</span> moral goodness—goodness which is absolutely complete and above temptation at the very outset—belongs alone, nay, belongs <span class="ital">necessarily</span> to God. In this way the apparent contradiction between this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-18.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.">Mark 10:18</a> may be resolved. For the rest, the notion of sin as a necessary transitional point in human development is shown to be groundless by the historic fact of the sinlessness of Jesus. See Ernesti, <span class="ital">Ursprung der Sünde</span>, I. p. 187 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[34] Polyb. 16. 20, 6, is, without reason, adduced by Tholuck against this view. In the passage referred to, <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίαι</span> are <span class="ital">faults, goings wrong</span> in general. The sentence is a general maxim.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[35] Comp. Gess, <span class="ital">Pers. Chr.</span> p. 212. At the same time, the sinless development of Jesus is not to be subsumed under the conception of <span class="ital">sanctification</span>. See also Dorner’s <span class="ital">Sinless Perfection of Jesus</span>, and the striking remarks of Keim, <span class="ital">Geschichtl.

Nor is it sound exegesis to limit <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to one particular form of sin (such as "false doctrine," Calvin, Melancthon, Tholuck). There is no need to limit its reference; and in the unanswered query, while we cannot say that by itself this passage is sufficient to demonstrate the sinlessness of Christ, it reveals a sublime depth in his translucent consciousness that places him - unless he were the most deluded or self-sufficient of human teachers - on a different position from all other Divine messengers. In proportion as other great moral prophets have set their own standard high, they have become conscious of their own defects; and from Moses to St. Paul, from Augustine to St. Francis, the saintliest men have been the most alive to their own departures from their ideas of right. The standard of Jesus is higher than that of any other, and he appears nevertheless absolutely without need of repentance, above the power of temptation, beyond the range of conviction. True, the Jews brought a charge of madness and folly upon him immediately; but, so far from convincing him or mankind, they stand forever covered with the shame of their own incompetence to apprehend his message or himself. He being, then, without sin, and assuming that he stands in the eternal truth, and is the absolute Truth of things, and that he cannot from his moral purity deceive or misinform them, and that his testimony to himself is final, sufficient, and trustworthy, asks, <span class="cmt_word">If I say the truth</span> - without your having convicted me of sin or brought any moral obliquity or offence against me - <span class="cmt_word">if I say</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>truth, why do ye not believe me?</span> The reason is in them rather than in him. Their non-belief discloses no flaw in his revelation, but makes it evident that they and he are on different planes of being, with a discrepant, opposed, moral paternity. "Why do ye not believe me?" He marvelled at their unbelief! He is from God; they are from God's great enemy. The moral perfection of Jesus as the God-Man is absolutely necessary to his character as "God's Lamb," as "the Only Begotten," "the Son," and as "the Judge," of the human race. As he subsequently said, "The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing fit me." To account for this sinless, perfect humanity, the entire conception of the Divine nature blended in indissoluble union with his own is found imperative at every epoch of Christ's life. At every development of his official character, in every new combination of circumstance, in conflict and sorrow, when smarting from treachery and dying alone upon the cross, he is "perfect," he fulfils the perfect norm, he reaches the standard of Divine humanity. There is no discrepance here with even Mark's account of his language to the young ruler (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-18.htm">Mark 10:18</a>), for he does not there say that he is not good, nor does he do other than suggest that he is identified with the One who is good. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Convinceth (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>.
