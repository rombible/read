The Father who glorified Him was the God whom they professed to serve. Their question, “Whom makest Thou Thyself? <span class= "ital">“</span>has its explanation in the fact that this service was independent of any real knowledge of God. The two verbs “know” and “known” here do not represent the same Greek word. More exactly the rendering should be, <span class= "ital">And ye have not come to know Him: but I know Him.</span> The one clause expresses acquired recognition; the other expresses immediate essential knowledge. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-7.htm" title="If you had known me, you should have known my Father also: and from now on you know him, and have seen him.">John 14:7</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">If I should say, I know him not.</span>—The thought of their want of perception of God has led to the assertion by contrast of His own full intuitive knowledge of God. To assert this knowledge is to make Himself greater than Abraham and the prophets; but there is untruth in silence as well as in utterance, and His very truthfulness demands the assertion.<p><span class= "bld">But I know him, and keep his saying.</span>—Or better, <span class= "ital">His word,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-51.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.">John 8:51-52</a>. Again the positive statement is made in the certainty of His full knowledge, and this is followed by a statement of the observance of the same condition of communion with the Father which He had made necessary for communion of the disciples with Himself.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:54-59 Christ and all that are his, depend upon God for honour. Men may be able to dispute about God, yet may not know him. Such as know not God, and obey not the gospel of Christ, are put together, 2Th 1:8. All who rightly know anything of Christ, earnestly desire to know more of him. Those who discern the dawn of the light of the Sun of Righteousness, wish to see his rising. Before Abraham was, I AM. This speaks Abraham a creature, and our Lord the Creator; well, therefore, might he make himself greater than Abraham. I AM, is the name of God, Ex 3:14; it speaks his self-existence; he is the First and the Last, ever the same, Re 1:8. Thus he was not only before Abraham, but before all worlds, Pr 8:23; Joh 1:1. As Mediator, he was the appointed Messiah, long before Abraham; the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, Re 13:8. The Lord Jesus was made of God Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption, to Adam, and Abel, and all that lived and died by faith in him, before Abraham. The Jews were about to stone Jesus for blasphemy, but he withdrew; by his miraculous power he passed through them unhurt. Let us stedfastly profess what we know and believe concerning God; and if heirs of Abraham's faith, we shall rejoice in looking forward to that day when the Saviour shall appear in glory, to the confusion of his enemies, and to complete the salvation of all who believe in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If I honour myself - If I commend or praise myself.

The reality of the Father in his Divine-human consciousness, expressing itself through his human thought and word, was supreme, overmastering, sublime - <span class="cmt_word">I shall be, like you, a liar;</span> I should deceive you wilfully, as you are deceiving yourselves. We cannot fail here again to observe the severity of Jesus as portrayed in this Gospel. (There is nothing surely here, or in other numerous utterances in this discourse, inconsistent with the Son of Thunder.) No cowardly modesty (Lange) is possible to him. He knows, and must speak. He cannot, dare not, be silent, or allow these bitter enemies, with their ready malice and perverse and continuous misinterpretation of his words, to be ignorant, either of the ground of his self-consciousness or his penetration of their flimsy excuses. So once more he adds, <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">I know him, and keep</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his word.</span> He will not allow this Divine consciousness to be taken from him, even by the shame and agony of the cross (Lange). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Saying (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Properly, word, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm">John 8:51</a>.
