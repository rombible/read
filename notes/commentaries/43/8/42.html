He is the author of all lies; whom liars resemble and obey, with whom all liars shall have their portion for ever.

Meyer and others would make both verbs depend on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: but if we are right in the special meaning of the preposition, the force of it would be lost in the second clause. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> refers to his eternal procession from the very nature of God, and special indication of it when he took our human nature up into his own; and the <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span> refers to his presence and appearance in their midst as a "Man who told them the truth." <span class="cmt_word">For neither have I come.</span> The perfect tense here is used in contrast to the present <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, to show that he has the whole past of his career as a divinely sent Messenger present in his consciousness. And he establishes the fact that he has proceeded from God by the dismission of every other alternative. <span class="accented">I have not come <span class="cmt_word"></span>from myself</span>, as an act of self-determination; I have not come to do my own will, but the Father's. I have not come on any self-chosen, self-honouring path, with motives of self-interest; <span class="cmt_word">but</span> in strict obedience to the Father's injunction - <span class="cmt_word">he sent me.</span> You would have loved me, not hated me, you would have trusted me and rejoiced in me, and not sought to kill me, if God were your Father; for you would then have felt all through my career that <span class="accented">that</span> One Father, of whom you boast an intimate knowledge, was revealing himself as One near to you, close to you, in the bare fact of my presence among you. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I proceeded forth - from God (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., came forth.
