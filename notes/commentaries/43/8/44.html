The father who has been referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-38.htm" title="I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.">John 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-41.htm" title="You do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.">John 8:41</a> is now definitely named. The relation between father and son is maintained, but the father of the thoughts and acts of those to whom He speaks was not God, not Abraham, but the devil.<p><span class= "bld">And the lusts of your father ye will do.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">ye desire to do, ye will to do.</span> The verb is not an auxiliary, as it appears to be in our version, but expresses the determination of the will.

Nevertheless, through envy of the devil came death into the world, and they that do hold of his side do find it.” So St. Paul, “By one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>). The Fall was the murder of the human race; and it is in reference to this, of which the fratricide in the first family was a signal result, that the Tempter is called a murderer from the beginning (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>). “Cain was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.” (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-8.htm" title="He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.">1John 3:8-12</a>, where the thought is expanded.) The reference to the murderer is suggested here by the fact that the Jews had been seeking to kill our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-40.htm" title="But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.">John 8:40</a>). They are true to the nature which their father had from the beginning.<p><span class= "bld">And abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.</span> The word is not that which we have before had in the sense of “abide” (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-38.htm" title="And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.">John 5:38</a>), and the tense of the verb is present in meaning. The words do not refer to the fall of the devil, which is here implied but not stated, but to his constant character. He has no place in the sphere of the truth; it is not the region of his action and outer life; and the result of this is that there is no truth in the sphere of his thought and inner life. Had he been true, he would have come to stand in the light and life of truth.<p><span class= "bld">When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own.</span>—This is in contrast to the work of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-40.htm" title="But now you seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.">John 8:40</a>) and to the work of the Holy Spirit (Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13</a>.) The Holy Spirit will not speak of Himself; He came to speak the truth which He heard from God. The devil speaketh a lie (comp. Genesis 3), and this is of his own (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-35.htm" title="A good man out of the good treasure of the heart brings forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.">Matthew 12:35</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For he is a liar, and the father of it.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">and the father of the liar.</span> This is probably the meaning of the Greek, and it can only be expressed in English by the repetition of the substantive. The verse ends as it begins, by a reference to the Jews whom He is addressing. They were of the nature of him whose spiritual children they were. The murderous thoughts in their hearts, and their non-receptivity of truth, plainly indicated who their father was.<p>The reader will hardly, perhaps, need to be cautioned against the old heretical rendering of the first and last clauses of this verse, by “Ye are of the father of the devil . . . for he is a liar, and also his father.” Still, as this view has been revived in some quarters in our own day, one word of reminder that it is no less opposed to the context and the teaching of this Gospel than it is to the whole tenor of Biblical truth and of rational theology, may not be misplaced. On the personality of the devil, which, if plain words have any meaning, is here implied in the words of Christ, see Notes on Matthew 4.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do.

The account which Josephus gives of the wickedness of the Jews, about this time, abundantly vindicates this assertion of our Lord from any appearance of undue severity. <span class="ital">He was a murderer </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ανθρωποκτονος</span>, <span class="ital">man-slayer, </span>or <span class="ital">man-killer; from the beginning </span>— The common term for <span class="ital">murderer, </span>in the New Testament, is <span class="greekheb">φονευς</span>. And it seems “not without intention, that the devil, a being not of earthly extraction, is rather called a <span class="ital">manslayer </span>than a <span class="ital">murderer, </span>as marking with greater precision his enmity to the human race.” — Campbell. Satan was a <span class="ital">manslayer </span>in inclination, <span class="ital">from the beginning </span>of his becoming a devil, and actually such from the beginning of the world: for, from the beginning of the creation, he contrived and designed the ruin of mankind. And he has ever since endeavoured to work their ruin; sometimes by seducing them into sin by his lies, (for as <span class="ital">he abode not in the truth, there is no truth in him,</span>) and sometimes by instigating them to kill those whom God sends to reclaim them; as well as in various other ways. Withal, having early departed from holiness and truth, a habit of lying has become perfectly natural to him; and <span class="ital">when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own </span>— Speaketh what is proper to himself, he being the proper parent, and, as it were, creator of lying. <span class="ital">Because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not </span>— Ye, his children, disbelieve me, because, instead of soothing you in your sins, and flattering you with lies, I tell you the truth, to which, like your father, you are utterly averse. <span class="ital">Which of you convinceth me of sin? — </span>Greek, <span class="greekheb">ελεγχει με περι αμαρτιας</span>, <span class="ital">which of you convicteth me of sin. </span>The word <span class="ital">convinceth </span>is not the proper term in this place; for it relates only to the opinion of the person himself, about whom the question is. But our Lord here, in order to show that the unbelief of his hearers had no reasonable excuse, challenges them openly to convict him, if they could, in any instance, of a deviation from truth or righteousness. As if he had said, Bring evidence of such a deviation, evince it to the world: prove that I have not received my commission from God; or that I have done something to render me unworthy of credit. Show, if you can, that I have taught false doctrine, reproved you unjustly for your actions, or committed sin myself. If you cannot, but must acknowledge that my life is as unreprovable as my doctrine; that the latter is confirmed by the former, and that both are such as become a messenger of God; what is the reason that ye do not believe me? <span class="ital">He that is of God, heareth God’s words </span>— He that is a child of God, humbly receiveth the revelations which God makes of himself by his messengers, hears his words, and obeys his commands, with joy and reverence. <span class="ital">Ye, therefore, hear them not </span>— Ye reject the revelations, doctrines, commandments, promises, and threatenings, and his word in general, declared by me, his Messenger, and my servants, for no other reason but because you are not his children.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:41-47 Satan prompts men to excesses by which they murder themselves and others, while what he puts into the mind tends to ruin men's souls. He is the great promoter of falsehood of every kind. He is a liar, all his temptations are carried on by his calling evil good, and good evil, and promising freedom in sin. He is the author of all lies; whom liars resemble and obey, with whom all liars shall have their portion for ever. The special lusts of the devil are spiritual wickedness, the lusts of the mind, and corrupt reasonings, pride and envy, wrath and malice, enmity to good, and enticing others to evil.

You do what pleases him.<p>Ye will do - The word "will," here, is not an auxiliary verb. It does not simply express futurity, or that such a thing will take place, but it implies an act of volitions. This you will or choose to do. The same mode of speech occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-40.htm">John 5:40</a>. In what respects they showed that they were the children of the devil he proceeds to state:<p>1. in their murderous disposition;<p>2. in rejecting the truth;<p>3. in being favorable to falsehood and error.<p>He was a murderer from the beginning - That is, from the beginning of the world, or in the first records of him he is thus represented. This refers to the seduction of Adam and Eve. Death was denounced against sin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>. The devil deceived our first parents, and they became subject to death, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. As he was the cause why death came into the world, he may be said to have been a murderer in that act, or from the beginning. We see here that the tempter mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> was Satan or the devil, who is here declared to have been the murderer. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>; "And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world." Besides, Satan has in all ages deceived men, and been the cause of their spiritual and eternal death. His work has been to destroy, and in the worst sense of the word he may be said to have been a murderer. It was by his instigation, also, that Cain killed his brother, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>; "Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother." As the Jews endeavored to kill the Saviour, so they showed that they had the spirit of the devil.<p>Abode not in the truth - He departed from the truth, or was false and a liar.<p>No truth in him - That is, he is a liar. It is his nature and his work to deceive.<p>He speaketh of his own - The word "own" is in the plural number, and means of the things that are appropriate to him, or that belong to his nature. His speaking falsehood is originated by his own propensities or disposition; he utters the expressions of his genuine character.<p>He is a liar - As when he deceived Adam, and in his deceiving, as far as possible, the world, and dragging man down to perdition.<p>The father of it - The father or originator of falsehood. The word "it" refers to lie or falsehood understood. From him falsehood first proceeded, and all liars possess his spirit and are under his influence. As the Jews refused to hear the truth which Jesus spoke, so they showed that they were the children of the father of lies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>44. Ye are of your father the devil&#8212;"This is one of the most decisive testimonies to the objective (outward) personality of the devil.

The death of the human race, in its widest sense, is ascribed to the murderous seducer of our race.<p>and abode not in the truth&#8212;As, strictly speaking, the word means "abideth," it has been denied that the fall of Satan from a former holy state is here expressed [Locke, &c.], and some superior interpreters think it only implied [Olshausen, &c.]. But though the form of the thought is present&#8212;not past&#8212;this is to express the important idea, that his whole character and activity are just a continual aberration from his own original truth or rectitude; and thus his fall is not only the implied basis of the thought, but part of the statement itself, properly interpreted and brought out.<p>no truth in him&#8212;void of all that holy, transparent rectitude which, as His creature, he originally possessed.<p>When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own&#8212;perhaps his own resources, treasures (Mt 12:35) [Alford]. (The word is plural). It means that he has no temptation to it from without; it is purely self-begotten, springing from a nature which is nothing but obliquity.<p>the father of it&#8212;that is, of lying: all the falsehood in the world owes its existence to him. What a verse is this! It holds up the devil (1) as the murderer of the human race; but as this is meant here in the more profound sense of spiritual death, it holds him up, (2) as the spiritual parent of this fallen human family, communicating to his offspring his own evil passions and universal obliquity, and stimulating these into active exercise. But as there is "a stronger than he," who comes upon him and overcomes him (Lu 11:21, 22), it is only such as "love the darkness," who are addressed as children of the devil (Mt 13:38; 1Jo 3:8-10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Our Saviour now plainly tells them what he meant by their <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">father, </span> mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-38.htm" title="I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.">John 8:38</a></span>; viz. the devil, whose children though they were not by natural traduction, yet they were by imitation, wilfully doing the things which the devil would have them do. He instances in two of these lusts: 1. Murder. He saith, The devil from the beginning of the world had a mind and design against the sons of men; and he ever since (as the apostle tells us, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-9.htm" title="Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothers that are in the world.">1 Peter 5:9</a></span>) hath gone about like <span class="ital">a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</span> And in this they were his true children, using all arts imaginable to destroy him whom God had sent into the world for man’s salvation. In another thing also they were the true and genuine children of the devil; the devil had <span class="ital">no truth in him, </span> nor did he abide in the truth. God indeed created the angels (who afterward fell) in a state of rectitude, without unrighteousness; but they did not keep their first station. So, neither did they love the truth, nor abide in it, but were wholly false and liars, and could not abide the truth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye are of your father the devil,.... Not of his substance, but by imitation and example; and as being under his authority and influence, his instructions and directions, and ready to follow after him, and obey his commands; the word "your" is rightly supplied, and is in some copies: <p>and the lusts of your father ye will do; the Syriac and Persic versions read in the singular number, "the lust", or "desire of your father"; by which may be particularly meant, his eager desire after the death of Christ, which he showed at different times; he instigated Herod to seek to destroy his life in his infancy, and when he was just entering on his public ministry, he tempted him to destroy himself; and often stirred up the Scribes and Pharisees, to stone him or kill him, some other way; and at last put it into the heart of one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, to betray him: this looks as if though the devil had a notion of the salvation of men by Christ, yet that he thought, as some erroneous men have also done, that it was only by his doctrine and example, and therefore he was in haste to get him out of the world, that he might not be useful, or any more so that way; and not by the shedding of his blood, the sacrifice of himself, or by his sufferings and death, in the room of sinners; or otherwise it is scarcely credible, that he would have sought his death so earnestly: now this selfsame lust and insatiable desire after the death of Christ prevailed in the Jews; and they were resolute and bent upon fulfilling it at any rate, nor could anything divert them from it; this is the thing Christ is speaking of in the context, and is what fully proved the devil to be their father, and them to be his children: <p>he was a murderer from the beginning; he was not only spoken of from the beginning, as he that should bruise the Messiah's heel, or should compass his death, but he was actually a murderer of Adam and Eve, and of all their posterity, by tempting them to sin, which brought death and ruin upon them; and who quickly after that instigated Cain to slay his brother; and has had, more or less, a concern in all murders committed since; and has been in all ages, and still is, a murderer of the souls of men; and therefore is rightly called Abaddon, and Apollyon, which signify the destroyer: the phrase, "from the beginning", does not intend the beginning of his own creation; for he was created a holy creature, was in the truth, though he abode not in it; and was in an happy state, though he lost it: nor strictly the beginning of time, or of the creation of the world, which were some days at least before the fall of man, when the devil commenced a murderer; but it being very near it, therefore this phrase is made use of: the Syriac version renders it, "from Bereshith", which is the first word in the Hebrew Bible, and is frequently used by the Jewish Rabbins for the six days of the creation; and if Adam fell, as some think, the same day he was created, it might be properly said that the devil was a murderer from thence. Philo (p) speaks of Eve's serpent, as , "a murderer of man"; applying to this purpose the text before referred to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; <p>and abode not in the truth; neither in the integrity, innocence, and holiness, in which he was created; nor in veracity, or as a creature of veracity, but spake lies, and formed one, by which he deceived Eve, saying, "ye shall not surely die", <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-4.htm">Genesis 3:4</a>, when God had said they should, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>; nor in the truth of the Gospel, which was at least in part made known unto him; particularly that the Son of God should become man, and in that nature be the head of angels and men: this he and his associates, in the pride of their hearts, not bearing that the human nature should be exalted above that of theirs, left their first estate, broke off their allegiance to God, and turned rebels against him: <p>because there is no truth in him; not that this is a reason why he continued not in the truth, for there was originally truth in him; though he abode not in it; but a reason, showing there was none in him now, since he was fallen from it, and abode not in it; there is no truth in him, that is natural and genuine, and essential to him; and if at any time he speaks it, it is not from his heart, but because he is forced to it, or has an evil design in it: <p>when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; that is genuine and natural, of his own devising, willing, and approving: <p>for he is a liar, and the father of it; he was a liar, as early as he was a murderer, or rather earlier; it was with a lie he deceived, and so murdered our first parents, and he has continued so ever since; he was the first author of a lie; the first lie that ever was told, was told by him; he was the first inventor of one; he was the first of that trade; in this sense the word "father" is used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-20.htm">Genesis 4:20</a>; so the serpent is by the Cabalistic Jews (q) called, the lip of lie, or the lying lip. <p>(p) De Agricultura, p. 203.

John could have written simply <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ διαβ</span>., if the connection had not required that prominence should be given to the idea of <span class="ital">father</span>.

Erroneously also Grotius, who explains the passage as though it ran,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ πατρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῶν διαβόλων</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰς ἐπιθυμίας</span>, etc.] The <span class="ital">conscious will</span> of the child of the devil is to accomplish that after which its father, whose organ it is, lusts. This is rooted in the similarity of their moral nature. The <span class="ital">desire to kill</span> is not exclusively referred to, though, as even the plural <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμίας</span> shows, it is included.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΕῖΝΟς</span></span></span>, etc.] for <span class="ital">murder</span> and <span class="ital">lying</span> were just the two devilish lusts which they were minded to carry out against <span class="ital">Jesus</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀνθρωποκτόνος ἦν ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς</span>] <span class="ital">from the beginning</span> of the human race. This more exact determination of the meaning is derivable from <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρωποκτόνος</span>, inasmuch as it was through his seduction that the <span class="ital">fall</span> was brought about, in whose train death entered into the world (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>).

The determining cause of this inner ground, however, is expressed by the words <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, which are emphatically placed at the end. As truth is not found <span class="ital">in him</span>, as it is lacking to <span class="ital">his inner essence and life</span>, it cannot possibly constitute the sphere of his objective life. Without truth in the inward parts—truth regarded, namely, as a subjective qualification, temper, tendency—that is, without truth in the character, a man must necessarily be foreign to, and far from, the domain of objective truth, and cannot have his life and activity therein. Without truth in the inward parts, a man deals in life with lies, deception, cunning, and all <span class="greekheb">ἀδικία</span>. Note that <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθ</span>. is used first <span class="ital">with</span>, and then <span class="ital">without</span>, the article.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων</span>] <span class="ital">of that which is his own</span>, which constitutes the proper ground or essence of his inner man,—of that which is most peculiarly his ethical nature. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-34.htm" title="O generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.">Matthew 12:34</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ</span>] namely, <span class="ital">of the liar;</span> he, <span class="ital">generically</span> considered, to wit, the liar as such <span class="ital">in general</span>, is the devil’s child. The characterization of the devil thus aptly concludes with a declaration which at the same time confirms the reproach, <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς ἐκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πατρὸς τοῦ διαβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐστέ</span>. The less to be approved, therefore, is the <span class="ital">common</span> explanation of <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, as standing for <span class="greekheb">τοῦ ψεύδους</span>, which is to be derived from <span class="greekheb">ψεύστης</span> (<span class="ital">mendacii auctor</span>, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-4.htm" title="And the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die:">Genesis 3:4</a> f.); although, linguistically considered, it is in itself admissible (Winer, p. 181 f. [E. T. p. 138]; Buttmann, p. 93 [E. T. p. 106]). The correct view has been taken also by B. Crusius, Luthardt, Tholuck, Hengstenberg, and as early as Bengel. The old heretical explanation, “<span class="ital">as his father</span>,”[32] or, “<span class="ital">also his father</span>,” as though <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> referred to the <span class="ital">devil</span>, and the <span class="ital">demiurge</span>, whose lie is the pretending to be the most high God, were really intended (Hilgenfeld, Volkmar), must be rejected; for, on the one hand, John ought at the very least, in order to avoid being completely misunderstood, to have written <span class="greekheb">ὅτι αὐτὸς ψ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀ</span>.;[33] while, on the other hand, he did not in the remotest degree entertain the monstrous, wholly unbiblical notion of a <span class="ital">father of the devil</span>. Nay, further, a father of <span class="ital">this kind</span> would not at all harmonize with the context. Even a writer as early as Photius, <span class="ital">Quaest. Amphiloch</span>. 88, takes the opposite view; as also Ewald, <span class="ital">Jahrb</span>. V. p. 198 f. It was in the highest degree unnecessary that Lachmann, (<span class="ital">Praef</span>. II. p. 7), in order to avoid having to refer <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> to the devil, should have approved the reading <span class="ital">qui</span>, or <span class="greekheb">ὃς ἄν</span>, instead of <span class="greekheb">ὅταν</span>, which is supported by the feeblest evidence: “qui loquitur mendacium, ex propriis loquitur, quia patrem quoque mendacem habet.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[29] In his <span class="ital">Leben Jesu</span> (p. 338 ff.), Schleiermacher groundlessly advances the opinion that Jesus had here no intention of teaching any doctrine regarding the devil, but wished merely to add force to His reproach by referring to the generally-adopted interpretation of the narrative of the fall. On the contrary, by His reproach, he not merely <span class="ital">lays down</span> the doctrine, but also further intentionally and explicitly <span class="ital">expounds</span> it, especially by assigning the ground, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι οὐχ ἔστιν</span>, etc. Baur (still in his <span class="ital">Neut. Theol.</span> p. 393) deduces from this passage that, according to John, Jesus had little sympathy for the Jews. He is speaking, however, not at all against the <span class="ital">Jews in general</span>, but merely against the <span class="ital">party that was hostile</span> to Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[30] Comp. also Martensen’s <span class="ital">Dogmatics</span>, § 105. Delitzsch, too (see <span class="ital">Psychol.</span> p. 62), explains the passage as though <span class="greekheb">εἱστήκει</span> were used: the devil, instead of “<span class="ital">taking</span> his stand in the truth,” revolted, as the god of the world, selfishly against God; for which reason the world has been “degraded and materialized” by God to a תהו ובהו, etc. In this way a new creation of the world is made out of the creation in Genesis 1, and out of the first act in the history of the world, a second.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[31] At the same time, we do not mean herewith to <span class="ital">deny</span> to John the idea of a <span class="ital">fall</span> of the devil, or, in other words, to represent him as believing the devil to have been <span class="ital">originally</span> evil. The passage under consideration treats merely of the evil constitution of the devil <span class="ital">as it is</span>, without giving any hint as to its origin. This in answer to Frommann, p. 330, Reuss, and Hilgenfeld. In relation to the doctrine of the <span class="ital">fall</span> of the devil <span class="ital">nothing</span> is here taught. Comp. Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbeweis</span>, passim; Hahn, <span class="ital">Theol. d. N. T.</span> I. p. 319. Such a fall is, however, necessarily presupposed by this passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[32] Hence, also, the readings <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> and <span class="greekheb">καθὼς καί</span>, instead of <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, which, though early in date, are supported by feeble testimony.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[33] Comp.

This was the result and evidence of their paternity: <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span> … [<span class="greekheb">τοῦ πατρὸς</span> is read by all recent editors]. “Ye are of the father who is the devil.” The translation, “of the father of the devil,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the (Gnostic) God of the Jews, is, as Meyer says, thoroughly un-Johannine. Perhaps a slight pause before the culminating words <span class="greekheb">τοῦ διαβόλου</span> would emphasise them and show that this had been in His mind throughout the conversation. Being, of this parentage they deliberately purpose [<span class="greekheb">θέλετε</span>] and not merely unintentionally are betrayed into the fulfilment of his desires. Their origin is determined by the fact that “from the first the devil was a manslayer”. To what does <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἀρχῆς</span> refer? Since the beginning of the human race, or since men first were killed; not since the devil’s beginning. Cyril and some others think it is the first murder, that of Abel, that is in view (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-15.htm" title="Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.">1 John 3:15</a>), but far more probably it is the introduction of death through the first sin (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-23.htm" title="For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity....">Wis 2:23-24</a>). So almost all recent commentators. Some think both references are admissible (see Lücke).—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ οὐχ ἕστηκεν</span>, “and stands not in the truth”. R.V[70] has “and stood not”; so the Vulgate “et in veritate non stetit”. W.H[71] adopt the same translation, reading <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔστηκεν</span>, the imperfect of <span class="greekheb">στήκω</span>, I stand; but good reasons against this reading are given by Thayer s.v. <span class="greekheb">ἕστηκεν</span> is the usual perfect of <span class="greekheb">ἵστημι</span> with the sense of a present. The reference therefore is not to the fall of the angels, but to the constant attitude of the devil; <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐμμένει</span>, Euthymius. “The truth is not the domain in which he has his footing.” Meyer, Weiss. He does not adhere to the truth and live in it. The reason being, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span>, “because truth is not in him”. There is not in him any craving for the truth. He is not true to what he knows. His nature is so false that <span class="greekheb">ὅταν λαλῇ τὸ ψεῦδος ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων λαλεῖ</span>, “whenever he speaks what is false, he speaks of his own”. “But the article may mean ‘the lie that is natural to him,’ ‘<span class="ital">his</span> lie’ ” (Plummer).—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων</span> means that he speaks out of that which is characteristically and peculiarly his (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-34.htm" title="O generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.">Matthew 12:34</a>); “because he is”—this is his character and description—“a liar and his father,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, he is himself a liar and the father of all liars. This is added to reflect light on the first statement of this verse. So Holtzmann and most recent interpreters. But Weiss rightly defends the reference of <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> to <span class="greekheb">ψεῦδος</span> as in A.V[72] Westcott proposes to translate: “Whenever a man speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own, for his father also is a liar”. Paley renders: “When (one) utters … he is speaking from his own, because he is a liar, and (so is) his father”. Westcott’s translation makes excellent sense and suits the context and gives a good meaning to the <span class="greekheb">ἰδίων</span>, but, as he himself owns, the omission of the subject (<span class="greekheb">ὅταν λαλῇ</span>) is certainly harsh; it may be said, impossible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[70] Revised Version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[71] Westcott and Hort.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[72] Authorised Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">44</span>. <span class="ital">Ye are of your father the devil</span>] At last Christ says plainly, what He has implied in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-38.htm" title="I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do that which you have seen with your father.">John 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-41.htm" title="You do the deeds of your father.

Thus here <span class="ital">the devil</span> is said to be <span class="ital">both a liar himself and father of every liar</span>. For the opposition is clear between God and the devil, and between the sons of God and the sons of the devil. The man who is a liar, is a son of the devil. It is not <span class="ital">the lie</span> that is said in this passage to be <span class="ital">the offspring</span> of the devil.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[229] The father of every one who is a liar.—E. and T.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are of the father who is the devil.</span> In this way the great bulk of the best commentators translate this difficult clause, Hilgenfeld, Volkmar, and Davidson translate, "You are of the father of the devil;" and suggest that here the evangelist betrays his fierce Gnostic (Ophite) antagonism to the Jews, and adopts the view that the God of the Old Testament, the "Creator," was the Father of the serpent. This is surely untenable. The Creator of all things, in the prologue, is none other than the Father acting through the Logos. In the third, fourth, and fifth chapters, the greatest honours are ascribed to the God of the Jewish people, and not the faintest hint given of such radical divergence from the standpoint of Judaism. In this very passage the father of the faithful Jews is spoken of with profound reverence. "The second-century Gnostic" must have so cleverly concealed his sentiments, and have refuted his position so frequently, that it is inexcusably inept for him to have shown his cloven foot on this occasion. Thoma ignores the wild conjecture of Hilgenfeld. Our Lord was not dealing with the parentage of the devil, but with the moral and religious parentage of those Jews who were manifesting the most bitter antagonism to himself and plotting his destruction. For them to claim spiritual kinship and childlike feeling to the Father whose holy nature and whose love to them he was revealing, was a strange contradiction in terms. Our Lord repudiated it in this terrible language. He had worsted the seductive suggestions of the devil, and when he saw and heard them repeated and set forth as Divine proposals, he gave them their true name. "You disclaim the faintest sympathy with other gods; you resent the bar sinister on your escutcheon; you say that religiously as well as historically you are not born of any fornication - there is no taint in your theological position; but I tell you plainly that <span class="accented">you are from</span>, you are manifesting the very essence and substance of, the father who is the prime enemy of God and man. The phrase is in perfect keeping with many synoptic phrases (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-15.htm">Matthew 23:15</a>; cf. John the Baptist's language, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the lusts of your father</span> - those of falsehood and murder, lying and slaughter, being the top and chief of all his evil passions - <span class="cmt_word">ye are</span> willing, <span class="cmt_word">desirous to do</span>. He has engendered these very lusts within you. The paternity of your angry passions, your incapacity to see and accept my word, are both alike explained. There is no more terrible rebuke in the whole compass of revelation. The disciple whom Jesus loved, in preserving these words, shows very decidedly that he was a "Son of Thunder," and calls down fire from heaven (a very storm) which has been ever since descending upon the heads of these and all other bitter antagonists of the Son of man. <span class="cmt_word">He was a murderer</span> (literally, <span class="accented">a manslayer</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>from the beginning.</span> This has often been referred to the spirit which animated Cain in the slaughter of his brother Abel. There is some corroboration of such a reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a>, "Cain was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of that wicked one, and slew his brother;" and in the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-15.htm">1 John 3:15</a>, "Whoso hateth his brother is a murderer." (So Lucke, Reuss, De Wette, and others.) But the narrative of the death of Abel makes no reference to the agency of the devil, but rather indicates that the sin of Cain was originated by his having been begotten in the image of the fallen Adam. The better interpretation and reference of the words may be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>, "He that doeth sin is from the devil (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), for the devil sinneth from the beginning (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>)." And sin entered into the world through the seduction and false statements of the devil, by which the first man was veritably slain, his moral nature killed outright. Grace was not shut out, but Adam died. In the day that he ate of the forbidden tree, man most surely and in the deepest sense <span class="accented">died.</span> "God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity. Nevertheless, through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of its side do find it" (Wisd. 2:23, 24; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-9.htm">Revelation 12:9</a>); "Sin entered into the world, and death by sin" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>). The work of destruction at the beginning of humanity upon earth has never been exhausted. In murderous propensity, in lying and seductive words and ways, the children of wrath are ever showing their parentage. To this statement  our Lord added what has by many been regarded as a distinct revelation of the fall of Satan himself from the condition of rectitude (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">2 Peter 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He stands not;</span> continues not - in the truth (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in the perfect is the better reading, and demands this translation; the rendering of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">stetit</span>, favoured by Augustine, and involving a reference to the <span class="accented">fall of the devil</span>, would have required <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, pluperfect). Jesus (lid not, therefore, explicitly assert anything with reference to the act of original revolt of the devil, but declared that the devil has no place in truth; he restlessly resists, throwing a hopeless, perilous glamour of falsehood round all he touches. Schaff suggests, rightly, that the combination of this statement with that of the prologue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>) <span class="accented">presupposes</span> the fall of this mighty and murderous spirit from a previous condition of rectitude, and the dictum of our Lord ought never to have been charged with the admission of an eternal principle of evil. The fall of the lost angels is not explicitly stated. <span class="cmt_word">Because there is no truth in him.</span> The absence of the article before "truth" shows that in the previous clause the objective truth is meant, that the reality of things as known by him is referred to. The truth was that region or sphere of action in which he elected not to stand, and, as a matter of fact, does not stand nor find place. By "truth" is meant subjective truth or "truthfulness," the spirit which repudiates falsehood in all its forms and manifestations. There is no consistency with himself, no inward harmony with reality. This is given as reason why the devil stands not in <span class="accented">the</span> truth. <span class="cmt_word">Whensoever</span> <span class="cmt_word">he</span> <span class="cmt_word">speaketh a lie, he speaketh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>, out of) <span class="cmt_word">his own</span> resources - from what is most entirely his own, revealing the depth of his truthless, loveless, fatal, godless nature. Schaff quotes from Gothe's 'Faust' the account which Mephistopheles gives of his own being. Here it is in Kegan Paul's translation - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I am the spirit, who aye deny!<br />And rightly so; for everything<br />Is only good for perishing;<br />So better 'twere that nought had been,<br />And, therefore, all that you call sin<br />Ruin, whate'er with evil's rife<br />Is my true element of life."</span> Gothe exactly expressed the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> by "mein eigentliches element." <span class="cmt_word">Because he is a liar, and the father of the liar.</span> This translation makes the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> refer to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, which is the most natural antecedent (so Bengel, Meyer, Lange, Godet, etc.), notwithstanding the difficulty of the construction. This language asserts not only the agelong proof which history gives of the falsehood of this terrible personality, but declares that he exerts an evil paternity in the life of every liar. "Brood of vipers" is a phrase used by John Baptist and Christ himself when addressing Pharisees. The well known imagery of the first promise, "I will put enmity between her seed and thy seed," etc., suggests the same thought. There is an awful significance in this power of the devil to sow his deadly seed in human life, and to produce thus, on the soil of human nature, "children of the wicked one" (cf. Paul's language, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm">Acts 13:10</a>, addressed to Elymas, <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "son of the devil"). Another translation makes <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> refer to <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">He is a liar, and the father of falsehood</span>, or <span class="accented">thereof</span> (Revised Version); thus drawing an abstract out of the concrete <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, or possibly referring to the first he which slew the spiritual life of men - to the "Ye shall not surely die" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-4.htm">Genesis 3:4</a>. It is against this view that our Lord is here dealing with persons rather than with abstractions. Westcott and Moulton and Revised Version in margin have given indefiniteness to the subject of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>, and translate, "Whensoever one [or, 'a man'] speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for his father also is a liar;" the idea being that the evil inheritance from the father of lies has even made falsehood the essential element, the <span class="accented">proprium</span>, of the liar. This, however, appears to involve a very complicated thought. The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, if strictly spoken, contradicts the idea of the liar's peculiarities being the result of inheritance. Still less satisfactory is the vain endeavour of the Gnostics, who found here a second reference to the father of the devil. They discovered in some Italic Versions, and in the usage of some of the Fathers, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, in place of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, and so took it to mean, "he is a liar, as also his father." Higenfeld and Volkmar have fastened upon this text also, and thus found further proof of Gnostic (Ophite) heresy in the Gospel. Riggenbach and Godet have remarked that, if the father of the devil was spoken of in the previous clause, "his father" would mean "the father of the father of the devil"! We have already seen how groundless such a charge against the Gospel is, and how such a rendering would throw the entire context into confusion. If we accept the first translation, we find that our Lord  announces a doctrine concerning the devil, and conveys more information than can be obtained from any other source. This is not mere accommodation to the consciousness of a daemoniac or the prejudices of the Jews, as some have interpreted Christ's language in the synoptic Gospels, but it is distinct dogmatic teaching about the personality, character, and method of the devil. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Emphatic, in contrast with &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, we, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-41.htm">John 8:41</a>.<p>Of your father (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;)<p>Very suggestive, implying community of nature, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-42.htm">John 8:42</a>.

This is explained by charging John with Gnosticism, and making him refer to the Demiurge, a mysterious and inferior being descended from God, by whom God, according to the Gnostics, created the universe, and who had rebelled against God, and was the father of Satan.
