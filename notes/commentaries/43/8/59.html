They had heard this I AM before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-24.htm" title="I said therefore to you, that you shall die in your sins: for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.">John 8:24</a>) without perceiving that in it He applied to Himself the name Jehovah. Now there is no room for doubt. His own Divinity is the only explanation of what He has said; and it is in these words so plainly asserted, that those who had constantly misunderstood can misunderstand no more. The subtleties of later days, by which men have tried to show that there is no claim to Divinity here, was not suggested to their minds. They will not acknowledge the claim, but they feel that He has made it. They have heard the fearful words which seemed to them as blasphemy, and they take up the stones which are at hand for the rebuilding of the Temple, in which they are, to cast at the Lord of the Temple. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-33.htm" title="The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone you not; but for blasphemy; and because that you, being a man, make yourself God.">John 10:33</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</span>—These words are omitted in a majority of the better MSS. They were probably inserted in others to explain what was taken to be the miraculous disappearance. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-30.htm" title="But he passing through the middle of them went his way,">Luke 4:30</a>.) Here we are simply told that He “hid Himself and went out of the Temple, and this does not imply more than that He passed among the crowd which was around Him, out of the Temple, and thus avoided the stones which they had taken up to cast at Him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:54-59 Christ and all that are his, depend upon God for honour. Men may be able to dispute about God, yet may not know him. Such as know not God, and obey not the gospel of Christ, are put together, 2Th 1:8. All who rightly know anything of Christ, earnestly desire to know more of him. Those who discern the dawn of the light of the Sun of Righteousness, wish to see his rising. Before Abraham was, I AM. This speaks Abraham a creature, and our Lord the Creator; well, therefore, might he make himself greater than Abraham. I AM, is the name of God, Ex 3:14; it speaks his self-existence; he is the First and the Last, ever the same, Re 1:8. Thus he was not only before Abraham, but before all worlds, Pr 8:23; Joh 1:1. As Mediator, he was the appointed Messiah, long before Abraham; the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, Re 13:8. The Lord Jesus was made of God Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption, to Adam, and Abel, and all that lived and died by faith in him, before Abraham. The Jews were about to stone Jesus for blasphemy, but he withdrew; by his miraculous power he passed through them unhurt. Let us stedfastly profess what we know and believe concerning God; and if heirs of Abraham's faith, we shall rejoice in looking forward to that day when the Saviour shall appear in glory, to the confusion of his enemies, and to complete the salvation of all who believe in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then took they up stones - It seems they understood him as blaspheming, and proceeded, even without a form of trial, to stone him as such, because this was the punishment prescribed in the law for blasphemy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-31.htm">John 10:31</a>. The fact that the Jews understood him in this sense is strong proof that his words naturally conveyed the idea that he was divine. This was in the temple. Herod the Great had not yet completed its repairs, and Dr. Lightfoot has remarked that stones would be lying around the temple in repairing it, which the people could easily use in their indignation.<p>Jesus hid himself - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-30.htm">Luke 4:30</a>. That is, he either by a miracle rendered himself invisible, or he so mixed with the multitude that he was concealed from them and escaped.

Before Abraham was, I am&#8212;The words rendered "was" and "am" are quite different. The one clause means, "Abraham was brought into being"; the other, "I exist." The statement therefore is not that Christ came into existence before Abraham did (as Arians affirm is the meaning), but that He never came into being at all, but existed before Abraham had a being; in other words, existed before creation, or eternally (as Joh 1:1). In that sense the Jews plainly understood Him, since "then took they up stones to cast at Him," just as they had before done when they saw that He made Himself equal with God (Joh 5:18).<p>hid himself&#8212;(See on [1814]Lu 4:30).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then took they up stones to cast at him; </span> as they also did, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-31.htm" title="If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.">John 5:31</a></span>. It is vain to inquire where they had stones in the temple; they might be repairing some part of it, or some parts of it paved with stones might be loose, &c.; it is enough that we are assured that some they found. He did not go <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">through the midst of them</span> that were in this uproar, but first thrust himself into the more innocent crowd, then passed through the midst of them. Some make a question here, how he could pass through the midst of them? Whether he made his body invisible? (so the Lutherans think); or whether he struck his enemies with blindness, or thickened the air before their eyes? But what needs that dispute? Admit some few of the rabble to be in a rage, the greatest part innocent, it is no hard thing for us to conceive how a person, discerning the disorder, may thrust himself into the more innocent crowd, and pass by, escaping the rage of his enemies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then they took up stones to cast at him,....

Should it be asked how they came by their stones in the temple? it may be replied, the temple was still building, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20</a>, and stones, or pieces of stones, might lie about, with which they furnished themselves, in order to have destroyed Christ: and this they attempted, though it was on the sabbath day, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-1.htm">John 9:1</a>; and with them, , "stoning on the sabbath day" (d) was allowed in some cases. <p>But Jesus hid himself, not in any corner of the temple, or behind a pillar; but he withdrew himself from them directly, and made himself invisible to them, by holding their eyes, or casting a mist before them, that they could not see him: <p>and went out of the temple; by one of the gates of it: <p>going through the midst of them; not of the persons that took up stones to stone him; but the rest of the people, who were there in great multitudes to hear his doctrine, and see his miracles: and so passed by, and escaped out of their hands; the last words, going through the midst of them, <p>and so passed by, are not in Beza's most ancient copy, and in the Vulgate Latin version. <p>(d) T.

A stoning in the temple is mentioned also by Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt</span>. xvii. 9. 3. The <span class="ital">stones</span> were probably building stones lying in the fore-court.

Zigabenus; comp. Grotius, Wolf, Bengel, Luthardt, Hilgenfeld, and even Augustine),—a notion which gave rise to the addition in the <span class="ital">Text. Rec</span>. (see the critical observations), which Ewald defends. Baur, who likewise defends the <span class="ital">Text. Rec</span>. (p. 384 ff.), finds here also a <span class="ital">docetic disappearance</span> (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-10.htm" title="But when his brothers were gone up, then went he also up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.">John 7:10</a> f.); if, however, such was John’s meaning, he selected the most unsuitable possible terms to express it in writing <span class="greekheb">ἐκρύβη</span> (comp. on the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-31.htm" title="And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.">Luke 24:31</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἄφαντος ἐγένετο ἀπʼ αὐτῶν</span>) and <span class="greekheb">ἐξῆλθεν ἐκ τοῦ ἱεροῦ</span>. The “<span class="ital">providential protection of God</span>” (Tholuck) is a matter of course, but is not expressed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no exegetical ground for supposing that the simple close of the narrative is designed to <span class="ital">prefigure</span> the death of Christ, which, being accomplished under the appearance of legality, released the Lord from the judgment of Israel, so that He left the old Israel as the school of Satan, and, on the other hand, gathered around Him the true Israel (Luthardt). Note how the breach between Jesus and the Jews gradually approached the extremity, and “how admirable, even in the details, is the delineation of the ever-increasing intensification of the crisis” (Ewald, <span class="ital">Gesch. Chr</span>. p. 477, ed. 3).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[43] Hengstenberg reverses the logical relation: <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐξῆλθε</span> stands, he says, for <span class="greekheb">ἐξελθών</span>, and describes <span class="ital">the manner in which</span> He hid Himself,—a purely arbitrary statement.

What the Jews thought of the assertion appeared in their action: <span class="greekheb">ἦραν</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτόν</span>. Believing that He was speaking sheer blasphemy and claiming equality with the great “I Am,” they sought to stone Him. For this purpose there was material ready to hand even in the Temple court, for, as Lightfoot reminds us, the building was still going on. “A stoning in the temple is mentioned by Josephus, <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xvii. 9, 3,” Meyer.—<span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦς δὲ ἐκρύβη καὶ ἐξῆλθεν</span>. “But Jesus went out unperceived”; on this usage <span class="ital">vide</span> Winer, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> Thayer. Why it should be supposed that there is anything miraculous or doketic in this (Holtzmann and others) does not appear. Many in the crowd would favour the escape of Jesus.

Here we need not suppose more than that He drew back into the crowd away from those who had taken up stones.
