From the passage it is clear that the word “treasury” was applied to the brazen trumpet-shaped chests placed in the court of the women for the reception of alms. There were thirteen of them, and each bore an inscription showing to what purpose the alms placed in it would be devoted. Here the word is apparently used of the place itself in which the chests were deposited, or the preposition must be taken as including the immediate neighbourhood. This notice of place is interesting in many ways. The court of the women was one of the most public places in the Temple area. He taught, then, openly and fearlessly. The chamber in which the Sanhedrin held their session was between the court of the women and that of the men. They had on that very day been assembled to take counsel against Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-45.htm" title="Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?">John 7:45-52</a>). This gives point to the words which follow, “and no man laid hands on Him, for His hour was not yet come.” The court of the women, moreover, was the spot where the great candelabra stood. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.">John 8:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-20.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.">John 8:20</a></span>. <span class="ital">These words spake Jesus in the treasury </span>— Which was a certain part of the women’s court, where the chests were placed for receiving the offerings of those who came to worship; and consequently was a place of great concourse. <span class="ital">And no man laid hands on him </span>— Though he so plainly intimated that God was his Father, and charged the Jews with being ignorant of him, while they boasted that he was in a peculiar sense their God; yet, their spirits were kept under such a powerful, though secret restraint, that no one seized him; which was the more wonderful, as it was a place much frequented by his greatest enemies, and from which it would not have been easy for him to have escaped without a miracle; <span class="ital">for his hour was not yet come </span>— In which he was, by divine permission, to be delivered into the hands of these wicked men.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:17-20 If we knew Christ better, we should know the Father better.

The time of our departure out of the world, depends upon God. Our enemies cannot hasten it any sooner, nor can our friends delay it any longer, than the time appointed of the Father.

The design of this observation of the evangelist, is to suggest to us, that it was in a very public place, in the temple, openiy, that Christ delivered the above words: <p>as he taught in the temple; where the Jews resorted, where his ministry was public, and he spake freely, and without reserve; in a very bold manner, with intrepidity, and without fear of man: <p>and no man laid hands on him; though they had sought to do it the day before; had sent officers to take him; and they themselves had a good will to it; and yet they were so awed and over ruled by one means, or one account or another, that no man did it; the reason was, <p>for his hour was not yet come; the time appointed for his sufferings and death. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">These words spake Jesus in the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; <span class="cverse3">{7}</span> for his hour was not yet come.</span><p>(e) This was a certain place appointed for the gathering of the offerings.<p>(7) We live and die according to the pleasure of God, and not of men: therefore it behooves us that we constantly go forward in our calling.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-20.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.">John 8:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ταῦτα τὰ ῥήματα</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-12.htm" title="Then spoke Jesus again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life....">John 8:12-13</a>.

It is not certain that there was a separate building called the treasury; and if there was, it is not probable that Christ would be able to address the multitude there. But the thirteen brazen chests, into which people put their offerings for the temple and other charitable objects, stood in the Court of the Women (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-41.htm" title="And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.">Mark 12:41</a>), and these chests seem to have been called ‘the treasury.’ The point seems to be that in so public and frequented a place as this did He say all this, and yet no man laid hands on Him (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-30.htm" title="Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.">John 7:30</a>).

But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.">John 8:6</a>. Thus then He did not write books in His own name, as the apostles did, nor did He use the apparatus of books; yet He dictated some epistles, Revelation 1 [<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-11.htm" title="She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you: go, and sin no more.">John 8:11</a>, What thou seest write in a book, and send it unto the Seven Churches—in Asia]. There remain the two titles, <span class="ital">Wisdom</span> and <span class="ital">Prophet</span>, applied to Him by implication, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-41.htm" title="The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here....">Matthew 12:41-42</a>, “Behold, a <span class="ital">greater than Jonas</span> is here:—Behold, a <span class="ital">greater than Solomon</span> is here.” The name, <span class="ital">Prophet</span>, is otherwise greater than that of Wisdom. In the case of Christ, the name, <span class="ital">Wisdom</span>, is in some measure more sublime than <span class="ital">Prophet</span>. He prayed, ever following the Father’s commands. He sweetly drew disciples to Himself; 1) as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-38.htm" title="Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, What seek you?

He taught <span class="ital">the people</span> in one way, <span class="ital">the Pharisees</span> in another way, <span class="ital">the disciples of John</span> in another, <span class="ital">His own disciples</span> in another. He taught concerning the fasting of the disciples of John, concerning the baptism of John, Matthew 21, concerning the tribute-money, etc. He taught by His works, rather than by His words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed there to teach and to preach in their cities.">Matthew 11:1</a>, etc. [To the disciples of John, inquiring, “Art Thou He that should come?” He replied, Go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see. The blind receive their sight, etc.] He taught also by gesture and look, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-17.htm" title="And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?">Luke 20:17</a>, “He <span class="ital">beheld</span> them, and said,” etc. [<span class="greekheb">ἐμβλέψας</span>]. He avoided celebrity and a crowd, Matthew 12 [16–21]. He taught by asking questions Himself: He taught also those who asked Him questions. He also observed a distinction in the disciples among one another. He taught in one way before the resurrection, and in another way after the resurrection. His prediction of His passion was, 1) enigmatical; 2) subsequently plain and open. His valedictory address followed, in fine, His departure itself, 1) at His passion; 2) at His ascension. He did not give over, until He was able to say, <span class="ital">Now ye believe</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-31.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?">John 16:31</a>. He confirmed His doctrine out of the Scriptures and by miracles. He desired the disciples to learn by experimental proof, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/16-22.htm" title="And you now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you....">John 16:22-23</a>, at the beginning, “In that day ye shall ask Me nothing” [<span class="greekheb">ἐρωτήσετε</span>]. He wisely took His opportunities, John 4. [The woman of Samaria at the well]. In a short interview on each occasion, He taught Nathanaël, and the Samaritan woman, what the disciples had taken several years to learn. Before the more elevated class of hearers He set elevated truths: John 3.[Nicodemus], He gradually opened out His subject: <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-4.htm" title="But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, you may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not to you at the beginning, because I was with you.">John 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-12.htm" title="I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.">John 16:12</a>, “I have yet many things to say unto you; but ye cannot bear them now;” <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-13.htm" title="However, Jesus spoke of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.">John 11:13</a>. He did not state all things altogether plainly; but wrapt them up in appropriate enigmatical forms. Many err by indiscriminate perspicuity. Our style of writing should not pass beyond the accustomed order of doctrinal teaching: if in any instance it shall be different, it will not glide off to philosophical aphorisms, but will betake itself to Holy Scripture. Moreover Christ did not remain in one place, nor always with the same persons. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-44.htm" title="For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.">John 4:44</a>, “He left His own country for Galilee, testifying that <span class="ital">a prophet is not in honour in his own country</span>.” He had the powers of a good teacher, and exhibited them sweetly and gently; Matthew 11; Luke 4. He sent forth twelve disciples, afterwards seventy. He gradually taught them to pray; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.">Luke 11:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-24.htm" title="Till now have you asked nothing in my name: ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.">John 16:24</a>, etc., “Hitherto have ye asked nothing in My name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may he full.”—<span class="greekheb">οὐδεὶς ἐπίασεν</span>, <span class="ital">no one laid hands on Him</span>) although they attempted it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-30.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Further controversy with different groups, ending in partial admission of his claims by some.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These words</span> - an expression which emphasized the foregoing interview, and shut it off from the following context - <span class="cmt_word">spake he</span> (<span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span>) <span class="cmt_word">in the treasury, as he taught in the temple courts</span>.

If so, it was in the "court of the women," or the place of public assembly most abundantly frequented by the multitude, and beyond which the women could not penetrate into the "court of the priests." Edersheim disputes Westcott's suggestion, that the <span class="accented">gazith</span>, or session house of the Sanhedrin, was close by, and that the language of Jesus was within earshot of <span class="accented">them.</span> This chamber, <span class="accented">gazith</span>, was in the southeast corner of the "court of the priests," and therefore far away from the treasure chamber. Supposing that the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was the treasury itself. the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> may point to the neighbourhood of the sacred enclosure. The reference shows that the locality even of the discourse had made profound impression on one of the disciples, and implies great publicity  and imminent peril from these bold avowals. The clause added by the evangelist, <span class="cmt_word">And no man seized him; because his hour was not yet come,</span> is a phrase repeated frequently, and one which delays, by a strange refrain, the tragic consummation (see Introduction, &sect; VII. 5 (4)). Here it shows that some further attempt was made to lay violent hands on him, which for the moment failed. Seeing that avowals of his Divine nature wrought to a frenzy the passions of soma of his hearers, and finally led to his condemnation for a capital offence, the evangelist again and again shows that the Lord - who made these claims on his trial, as given in the synoptists - had frequently reiterated them at peril of his life. The language of the high priest shows how bitterly the ecclesiastical authorities resented this assumption. The Fourth Gospel makes the synoptic account of this matter more intelligible by showing us that it was not an isolated occurrence. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The Treasury (&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>From &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;, treasure, a Persian word, occurring only once in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>), and &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#769;, guard.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a>. Laid hands on is better rendered, as elsewhere, took (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>). The inconsistency of the A.V. in the renderings of the same word, of which this is only one of many instances, is noteworthy here from the fact that in the only two passages in which John uses the phrase laid hands on (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-30.htm">John 7:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-44.htm">John 7:44</a>), he employs the common formula, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, or &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, and in both these passages the word &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is rendered take. The use of this latter word is confined almost exclusively to John, as it is found only three times elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-7.htm">Acts 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>). </body></html>
