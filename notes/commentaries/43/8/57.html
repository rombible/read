We know this from the testimony of Irenaeus, who appears to have this very passage in his mind, for he says, <span class= "ital">“</span>As the gospel and all the Elders witness” (Lib. 2 chap. 22 § 5; Oxford Translation, p. 160). But “fifty years” was the period of full manhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-39.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that enters into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 4:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm" title="This is it that belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:">Numbers 8:24</a>). This is expressed in round numbers, and there is no care to be more exact in comparison with the two thousand years which had passed since the close of Abraham’s earthly life. The thought is, “Thou art still a young man, and hast thou seen Abraham who died twenty centuries ago?”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:54-59 Christ and all that are his, depend upon God for honour. Men may be able to dispute about God, yet may not know him. Such as know not God, and obey not the gospel of Christ, are put together, 2Th 1:8. All who rightly know anything of Christ, earnestly desire to know more of him. Those who discern the dawn of the light of the Sun of Righteousness, wish to see his rising. Before Abraham was, I AM. This speaks Abraham a creature, and our Lord the Creator; well, therefore, might he make himself greater than Abraham. I AM, is the name of God, Ex 3:14; it speaks his self-existence; he is the First and the Last, ever the same, Re 1:8. Thus he was not only before Abraham, but before all worlds, Pr 8:23; Joh 1:1. As Mediator, he was the appointed Messiah, long before Abraham; the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, Re 13:8. The Lord Jesus was made of God Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption, to Adam, and Abel, and all that lived and died by faith in him, before Abraham. The Jews were about to stone Jesus for blasphemy, but he withdrew; by his miraculous power he passed through them unhurt. Let us stedfastly profess what we know and believe concerning God; and if heirs of Abraham's faith, we shall rejoice in looking forward to that day when the Saviour shall appear in glory, to the confusion of his enemies, and to complete the salvation of all who believe in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fifty years old - Jesus is supposed to have been at this time about the age of 33. It is remarkable that when he was so young they should have mentioned the number 50, but they probably designed to prevent the possibility of a reply. Had they said 40 they might have apprehended a reply, or could not be so certain that they were correct.<p>Hast thou seen Abraham? - It is remarkable, also, that they perverted his words. His affirmation was not that he had seen Abraham, but that Abraham had seen his day. The design of Jesus was to show that he was greater than Abraham, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-53.htm">John 8:53</a>. To do this, he says that Abraham, great as he was, earnestly desired to see his time, thus acknowledging his inferiority to the Messiah. The Jews perverted this, and affirmed that it was impossible that he and Abraham should have seen each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>57-59.

One copy reads forty, but he was not that; no, not much more than thirty; not above two or three and thirty years old: the reason of their fixing on this age of fifty might be, because Christ might look like such an one, being a man of sorrows and acquainted with griefs, as well as of great gravity; or they might be free in allowing him as many years, as could be thought he should be of, and gain their point; for what were fifty years, when Abraham had been dead above two thousand? and therefore he could never see Abraham, nor Abraham see him; moreover, this age of fifty, is often spoken of by the Jews, and much observed; at the age of fifty, a man is fit to give counsel, they say (a); hence the Levites were dismissed from service at that age, it being more proper for them then to give advice, than to bear burdens; a Methurgeman, or an interpreter in a congregation, was not chosen under fifty years of age (b); and if a man died before he was fifty, this was called the death of cutting off (c); a violent death, a death inflicted by God, as a punishment; Christ lived not to that age, he was now many years short of it: <p>and hast thou seen Abraham? if he had not, Abraham had seen him, in the sense before given, and in which Christ asserted it, and it is to be understood. <p>(a) Pirke Abot, c. 5. sect. 21.

The Jews, referring <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἶδε κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐχάρη</span> to the earthly life of Abraham, imagine the assertion of Jesus to imply that He had lived in the days of the patriarch, and professed to have been personally acquainted with him!

Consequently, neither the reading <span class="greekheb">τεσσαράκοντα</span> is to be preferred (Ebrard), nor need we conclude either that Jesus was above forty years of age (the Presbyters of Asia Minor in Iren. II. 22. 5); or that He was taken to be so old <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὴν πολυπειρίαν αὐτοῦ</span> (Euth. Zigabenus); or that He <span class="ital">looked</span> so old (Lampe, Heumann, Paulus); or that they confounded “the <span class="ital">intensity of the devotion of His soul</span>” as it showed itself in His person, with the traces of <span class="ital">age</span> (Lange, <span class="ital">Life of Jesus</span>). In the act of instituting a comparison with the <span class="ital">two thousand years</span> that had elapsed since Abraham’s day, they could not well care about determining very precisely the age of Christ. In answer to E. v. Bunsen (<span class="ital">The Hidden Wisdom of Christ, etc</span>., Lond. 1865, II. p. 461 ff.), who seeks to establish the correctness of the statement in Irenaeus, see Rösch in <span class="ital">Die Jahrb. für deutsche Theol</span>. 1866, p. 4 f.

This, however, the Jews completely misunderstand. They think that by asserting that Abraham saw His day, Jesus means to say that His day and the life of Abraham on earth were contemporaneous.—<span class="greekheb">Πεντήκοντα</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἑώρακας</span>; “Fifty years” may be used as a round number, sufficiently exact for their purpose and with no intention to determine the age of Jesus. But Lightfoot (<span class="ital">Hor. Heb.</span>, 1046) thinks the saying is ruled by the age when Levites retired, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-39.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that enters into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 4:39</a> : “Tu non adhuc pervenisti ad vulgarem annum superannuationis, et tune vidisti Abrahamum?” Irenaeus (ii. 22, 5) records that the Gospel (presumably this passage) and the Presbyters of Asia Minor who had known John, testified that Jesus taught till He was forty or fifty. This idea is upheld by E. v. Bunsen (<span class="ital">Hidden Wisdom of Christ</span>), and even Keim is of opinion that Jesus may have lived to His fortieth year.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">57</span>. <span class="ital">Then said the Jews</span>] Better. <span class="bld">Therefore</span> <span class="ital">said the Jews</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Thou art not yet fifty years old</span>] The reading, ‘forty years,’ which Chrysostom and a few authorities give, is no doubt incorrect. It has arisen from a wish to make the number less wide of the mark; for our Lord was probably not yet thirty-five, although Irenaeus preserves a tradition that He taught at a much later age. He says (ii. xxii. 5), <span class="ital">a quadrigesimo autem et quinquagesimo anno declinat jam in aetatem seniorem, quam habens Dominus noster docebat, sicut evangelium et omnes seniores testantur qui in Asia apud Joannem discipulum Domini convenerunt</span>. By ‘evangelium’ he probably means this passage. But ‘fifty years’ is a round number, the Jewish traditional age of full manhood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-39.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, every one that enters into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation,">Numbers 4:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/8-24.htm" title="This is it that belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:...">Numbers 8:24-25</a>). There is no reason to suppose that Jesus was nearly fifty, or looked nearly fifty. In comparing His age with the 2000 years since Abraham the Jews would not care to be precise so long as they were within the mark.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-57.htm" title="Then said the Jews to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?">John 8:57</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πεντήκοντα</span>, <span class="ital">fifty</span>) For contention’s sake they exaggerate the number. But, had they not been altogether forgetful of His nativity at Bethlehem, they would have said, Thirty years old, and not much more. As it is, they imply this by their words, Thou hast not yet reached a half century, in other words, the year of superannuation; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm" title="From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 4:3</a>, The term of the Levite service, “From thirty years old and upward, even until fifty years old,” as Lightfoot observes; whence it seems, the expression is not unlike an adage. It is not likely, that Jesus by reason of sorrows had contracted a premature appearance of old age. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm" title="You have loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Hebrews 1:9</a>, “God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with <span class="ital">the oil of gladness</span> above they fellows:” <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-15.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.">Matthew 9:15</a>, “<span class="ital">Can</span> the children of the bride-chamber <span class="ital">mourn</span>, as long as <span class="ital">the bridegroom</span> is with them?” ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-19.htm" title="And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.">John 11:19</a>, “The Son of Man came <span class="ital">eating and drinking</span>.”—<span class="greekheb">Ἀβραάμ</span>, <span class="ital">Abraham</span>) He had died 1850 years before this colloquy.—<span class="greekheb">ἑώρακας</span>, <span class="ital">hast thou seen</span>) They speak (and rightly so, indeed; comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-16.htm" title="A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me, because I go to the Father.">John 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-22.htm" title="And you now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man takes from you.">John 16:22</a>, “A little while, and <span class="ital">ye shall not see Me</span>, and again, a little while and <span class="ital">ye shall see Me</span>,” etc.: “Ye now have sorrow, but <span class="ital">I will see you</span> again,”) by the force of correlatives.

The Jews chose to regard the language of Jesus as adding another immense improbability, if not falsehood, to his previous claims, viz. that he had actually lived to twice the age of Methuselah already. The "fifty years old" may  have been simply used in round numbers for the age of man's prime and completed life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>). There may have been, even if our Lord was only thirty-three years of age at the time of his Passion, that which <span class="accented">apparently</span> added to his years. A tradition is mentioned (Irenaeus, 100, 2, 22. 5) of the more advanced age of Jesus which the Ephesian presbyters preserved, and which Irenaeus regards as between the forty-fifth and fiftieth years. Ernest de Bunsen vainly finds a reference to Christ's age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-20.htm">John 2:20</a>) in the forty-six years of the temple; but it is strange that, with the exception of the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>, there is nothing in the extraneous chronological data, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the death of Herod and recall of Pontius Pilate, which need positively compress our Lord's life within fifty years (Westcott). And Keim has made the suggestion that our Lord did carry on his ministry for a much longer period than is commonly supposed. It is far more probable, however, that the Jews were using an expression for the term of a completed life, and were supplying no chronological data whatever. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Thou art not yet fifty years old (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Literally, thou hast not yet fifty years.
