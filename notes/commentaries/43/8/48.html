The knowledge of this, and the simple way in which the fact is told, is one of many instances of the writer’s minute acquaintance with what was said and done by the leaders of the Jerusalem party. There is no instance given of the term “Samaritan” being applied to our Lord, but the term itself is frequently used by the Rabbis as one of opprobrium. The history of the fourth chapter is at once suggested to our minds, and was probably not absent from theirs. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-35.htm" title="Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?">John 7:35</a>.) There may have been facts more immediately connected with this very Feast of Tabernacles present to their minds, which are unknown to us. The going up secretly of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-10.htm" title="But when his brothers were gone up, then went he also up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.">John 7:10</a>, must almost certainly have been through Samaria. He had kept the last Passover in the despised Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm" title="And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was near.">John 6:4</a>). Had He kept Tabernacles in the hated Samaria? It is worth noting that the word Samaritan, in the singular, as applied to an individual, occurs but twice, except here and in John 4. One instance is in the parable spoken at no long interval after the present discourse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/10-25.htm" title="And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 10:25-37</a>). The other tells us that the only one of the ten lepers who turned back to glorify God “was a Samaritan” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-16.htm" title="And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.">Luke 17:16</a>).<p>The rendering, “and hast a devil,” is one which, probably, cannot now be improved. Wiclif’s word here is “fiend,” which in this sense is obsolete. But every reader of the Greek must feel how little our English word can represent the two distinct ideas, represented by two distinct words here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stayed not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.">John 8:44</a>. “Demon,” used originally for the lower divinities, and not unfrequently for the gods, passed in the Scriptures, which taught the knowledge of the true God, into the sense of an evil spirit. Thus the word which could represent the attendant genius of Socrates came to express what we speak of as demoniacal possession, and the supposed power of witchcraft and sorcery. Socrates is made to say, “For this reason, therefore, rather than for any other, he calls them demons, because they were prudent and knowing” (<span class= "ital">daēmones,</span> Plato, <span class= "ital">Cratylus,</span> xxiii.). The history of Simon Magus reminds us that the people of Samaria, from the least to the greatest, had been for a long time under the influence of his sorceries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:">Acts 8:9</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and it is probable that there is a special connection in the words here, “Thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon.” (Comp. <span class= "ital">Excursus III. on Notes to St. Matthew’s Gospel,</span> p. 185.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-48.htm" title="Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?...">John 8:48-53</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then answered the Jews, Say we not well </span>— Have we not just cause to say; <span class="ital">Thou art a Samaritan </span>— An enemy to our church and nation; <span class="ital">and hast a devil? </span>— Art possessed by a proud and lying spirit? The Jews and Samaritans bearing a mortal hatred to one another on account of religion, it happened, that in common language, Couthi, or Samaritan, was used to signify, not merely a Samaritan by country, but one by principle and disposition; and so denoted oft-times an inveterate enemy to the Jewish nation and religion, and a man of wicked morals. Thus, in our own language, a Turk signifies one of a barbarous disposition; and a Jew, one who is covetous and rich. <span class="ital">Jesus </span>to this insolent charge <span class="ital">answered </span>with great meekness, <span class="ital">I have not a devil </span>— As the whole series of my discourses and actions shows; nor can any of you produce any thing, in all that I have said or done, which looks like lunacy or impiety: <span class="ital">but, </span>the truth is, <span class="ital">I honour my Father </span>— By bearing a steady and consistent testimony to the doctrine he hath sent me to reveal to the world: and because this doctrine is contrary to your corrupt prejudices and passions, <span class="ital">you dishonour me </span>— By these and such like opprobrious reflections, in hope of discrediting my message. But as to what personally relates to me, I am little affected with it; for <span class="ital">I seek not my own glory: there is one, </span>however, <span class="ital">that seeketh </span>— And will secure it; <span class="ital">and </span>who now <span class="ital">judgeth </span>— Of all that passes, and will at length evidently show the exact notice he has taken of it, to my honour and to your confusion. For God will not only finally glorify me, but will confer the highest honours and rewards on all my faithful servants: and therefore, <span class="ital">Verily, I say unto you </span>— I assert it as an indisputable truth; <span class="ital">If a man — </span><span class="greekheb">Εαν τις</span>, <span class="ital">if any one; keep my saying </span>— Firmly believe, and steadily obey my word; <span class="ital">he shall never see death </span>— He shall never see spiritual and eternal death; and temporal death, the dissolution of his mortal nature, shall, with respect to him, hardly deserve the name of death; his soul, the real and true man, not dying at all, but passing into the paradise of God, and his body only falling asleep for a short season. Hereby our Lord proves that he was not a Samaritan, for the Samaritans, in general, were Sadducees. <span class="ital">Then the Jews </span>— Understanding him as asserting that his disciples should be exempted from the common lot of mortality; <span class="ital">said, Now we know that thou hast a devil </span>— Now we have full proof that thou art possessed by a demon, which hurries thee on to this madness and pride, otherwise thou couldest never talk at this extravagant rate. Abraham, the great friend of God, and the founder of our nation, is dead, and the prophets, holy and divinely inspired as they were, whom God raised up in succeeding ages, were so far from being able to bestow immortality on their followers, that even they themselves are long since dead; <span class="ital">and thou sayest </span>— In great presumption and pride; <span class="ital">If a man, </span>if any one, <span class="ital">keep my saying, </span>(see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.">John 8:51</a>,) <span class="ital">he shall never taste of death </span>— Not only he shall not die eternally, (in which sense the Jews did not understand our Lord’s words,) but he shall not die at all.

It had the force of charging him with being a heretic or a schismatic, because the Samaritans were regarded as such.<p>And hast a devil - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-20.htm">John 7:20</a>. This charge they brought against him because he had said that they were not of God or were not the friends of God. This they regarded as the same as taking sides with the Samaritans, for the question between the Jews and Samaritans was, which of them worshipped God aright, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a>. As Jesus affirmed that the Jews were not of God, and as he, contrary to all their views, had gone and preached to the Samaritans <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, they regarded it as a proof that he was disposed to take part with them. They also regarded it as evidence that he had a devil. The devil was an accuser or calumniator and as Jesus charged them with being opposed to God, they considered it as proof that he was influenced by such an evil spirit.<p>devil - In the original, demon.

Being incensed to the last degree, that he should say they were of their father the devil, and not of God; and that he spoke the truth, and no one could convince him of sin: <p>say we not well, that thou art a Samaritan? it seems they had said so before, though it is not recorded; and now they thought themselves justified in it, since he treated them, the true sons of Abraham, in such a manner; and the rather, since he had been lately among the Samaritans, and had in a parable spoken in favour of a Samaritan: they meant by this expression, that he was an irreligious man, and one that had no regard to the law of Moses; or at least played fast and loose with religion and the law, and was for any thing, as times served: the Jews had a very ill opinion of the Samaritans, on these accounts and to call a man a Samaritan, was all one as to call him an heretic, an idolater, or an excommunicated person; for such were the Samaritans with the Jews; they charged them with corrupting the Scriptures, and with worshipping idols, which were hid in Mount Gerizim; and they give us a dreadful account of their being anathematized by Ezra, Zorobabel, and Joshua; who, they say (r), <p>"gathered the whole congregation into the temple, and brought in three hundred priests, and three hundred children, and three hundred trumpets, and three hundred books of the law, in their hands; they blew the trumpets, and the Levites sung, and they anathematized the Samaritans, by the inexplicable name of God, and by the writing on tables, and with the anathema of the house of judgment, above and below; (saying,) let not any Israelite for ever eat of the fruit, or of the least morsel of a Samaritan; hence they say, whoso eateth the flesh of a Samaritan, it is all one as if he ate swine's flesh; also let not a Samaritan be made a proselyte, nor have a part in the resurrection of the dead; as it is said, "You have nothing to do with to build an house unto our God", <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-3.htm">Ezra 4:3</a>, neither in this world, nor in the world to come: moreover, also let him have no part in Jerusalem; as it is said, "But you have no portion, nor, right, nor memorial in Jerusalem", <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-20.htm">Nehemiah 2:20</a>; and they sent this anathema to the Israelites that were in Babylon, and they added thereunto, curse upon curse moreover, king Cyrus added an everlasting anathema to it, as it is said, "And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there, destroy", &amp;c. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-12.htm">Ezra 6:12</a>.'' <p>And hence, because the Samaritans were had in such abhorrence by the Jews, they would not ask a blessing over food in company with them (s), nor say Amen after they had asked one (t); nor indeed, after the better sort of them had asked, unless the whole blessing was distinctly heard (u), that so they might be sure there was no heresy in it; by all which it appears, how opprobrious this name was, and what a sad character was fixed upon a man that bore it;  see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-9.htm">John 4:9</a>; and as Christ was called by the Jews a Samaritan, they having no name more hateful and reproachful to call him by, so the Christians are still in their writings called Cuthites, or Samaritans; and it is indeed with them a general name for all Gentiles and idolaters, or whom they esteem such: <p>and hast a devil; familiarity and converse with one; by which means they imagined he knew their thoughts, and their actions, and by his assistance performed his miracles; or they took him for a lunatic, or a madman; whose lunacy and madness proceeded from the devil, with whom he was possessed: and this rather seems to be the sense, since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-52.htm">John 8:52</a> the Jews say they knew he had a devil, which they concluded from his saying, that such that observed his words, and kept them, should never die; which they considered as the words of a man out of his senses, seeing all men, even the best of men die, they not understanding his meaning; whereas they could not gather from hence, that he dealt with familiar spirits; and what still confirms this sense is, that these two are joined together in  <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-20.htm">John 10:20</a>, "he hath a devil, and is mad", and such as were demoniacs, men possessed with devils, were either mad, or lunatic, and melancholy; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-28.htm">Matthew 8:28</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-17.htm">Mark 9:17</a>. To which may be added, that it was a prevailing notion with the Jews, that madness and melancholy were owing to evil spirits, which had the predominancy over men: and seeing Christ was thought to be besides himself by his friends and relations, <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm">Mark 3:21</a>, it need not be wondered at, that his enemies should fix such a character on him; nor was this an unusual one to be given to good men; the prophets and spiritual men of the Old Testament were accounted madmen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>. And since our Lord was used in this abusive manner, it need not seem strange, that his followers should be treated in the same way; as the Apostle Paul and his companions in the ministry were, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-24.htm">Acts 26:24</a>; see  <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-20.htm">John 10:20</a>. <p>(r) Pirke Eliezer, c. 38.

Jesus replies at the close of the 54th verse and in the following verses, “It is My Father that honoureth Me, of whom ye say, that He is your God: Yet ye have not known Him, but I know Him.”—<span class="greekheb">συ</span>) <span class="ital">thou</span>, they say, no <span class="ital">we</span>.—<span class="greekheb">δαιμόνιον</span>, <span class="ital">a demon</span>) So they said, who supposed, that the words of Jesus flowed from a foolish pride and assumption. Thus is made clear the reference of those things which Jesus replies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-49.htm" title="Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honor my Father, and you do dishonor me.">John 8:49</a>, etc., “I have not a devil, but <span class="ital">I honour My Father</span>,” etc., “and I seek <span class="ital">not Mine own glory</span>.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - But it brought from them a shout of derision and a burst of scornful mockery. <span class="cmt_word">The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a daemon?</span> They imagine that the bare charge that they, the leaders of Israel, are "not of God," and that they reveal the fact by their inability to hear the words of God then sounding in their ears, was flat heresy, a gross lack of patriotism, and proved that, in his lofty self-assertion, he was no better than a Samaritan - the most hated of their neighbours. They return a harsh <span class="accented">tu-quoque</span> to our Lord's refusal to admit their Abrahamic descent, and his condemnation of their utter moral dissimilarity from their putative father. The sentence, "a Samaritan art thou!" is singularly insulting in its tone and form. We cannot measure the exact amount of insult they condensed into this word, whether it be of heresy, or alienation from Israel, or accusation of impure descent. It is remarkable that our Lord had shown special kindness to Samaritans (ch. 4.), and had made in his parable "the good Samaritan" the type of neighbourly love; but these very Jews had, in the height of this controversy, accused him of being a "Galilaean," and it is not probable that they used the term otherwise than as a soubriquet of scorn. Edersheim (<span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>, 2:174, 175) would translate into Aramaic the language here cited, and finds in its form <span class="accented">Shomroni</span> the real interpretation of its meaning. <span class="accented">Shomron</span> is, according to him, used in rabbinical writing for <span class="accented">Ashmedai</span>, and in the cabbalists is used for <span class="accented">Sammael</span> or <span class="accented">Satan.</span> Arabian traditions are brought in to confirm this interpretation of the speech, which he regards as equivalent to "Thou art a child of the devil," thus retorting upon Jesus the charge that they were doing the works of <span class="accented">their</span> father, the devil. The one expression is thought by Edersheim equivalent to that which follows, <span class="accented">thou hast a daemon</span>; and his explanation is thought to cover our Lord's silence respecting it. In our opinion this is far-fetched and unnatural. Christ's silence is better justified by his refusal to regard such a term as conveying opprobrium, tic had risen above the distinction of race, and could afford to despise the taunt. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-20.htm">John 7:20</a> (see note) a similar charge had been made by the angry Jews. The Lord is accused of being mastered by some daemon, who is perverting his mind and confusing his speech. Some further force is added to the charge from the language of the Talmud, 'Jebamoth,' fol. 47, <span class="accented">a</span>: "R. Nachman, son of Isaac, said to a Samaritan, 'Thou art a Cuthite, and testimony from thy mouth has no validity.'" <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Say we not well<p>Indicating a current reproach.
