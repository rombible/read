The Jews belonged to this present evil world, but Jesus was of a heavenly and Divine nature, so that his doctrine, kingdom, and blessings, would not suit their taste. But the curse of the law is done away to all that submit to the grace of the gospel. Nothing but the doctrine of Christ's grace will be an argument powerful enough, and none but the Spirit of Christ's grace will be an agent powerful enough, to turn us from sin to God; and that Spirit is given, and that doctrine is given, to work upon those only who believe in Christ. Some say, Who is this Jesus? They allow him to have been a Prophet, an excellent Teacher, and even more than a creature; but cannot acknowledge him as over all, God blessed for evermore. Will not this suffice? Jesus here answers the question. Is this to honour him as the Father? Does this admit his being the Light of the world, and the Life of men, one with the Father? All shall know by their conversion, or in their condemnation, that he always spake and did what pleased the Father, even when he claimed the highest honours to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When ye have lifted up - When you have crucified.

Not only is he "the Son," and "the Son of God," but indubitably he is also "the Son of man." He has come down from heaven and is before them as a Man among men - "one Jesus." He has taken upon himself the form of a slave, the fashion of man. That the manifestation of the Divine should be perfectly realized in the human, though a fundamental truth lying at the heart of all revelation, is nevertheless <span class="accented">not</span> the alphabet of Divine teaching; nay, it is the very highest and most recondite of all truths. This humbled humanity of the incarnate Logos led on to other issues of enormous significance. The eternal Son in the form of God would become, as "Son of man," obedient unto death. The highest revelation of the Son of God, and therefore of the Father, would be effected by the surrender of that mysterious life of his for the world's behoof. The previous announcements of this truth, which we now see to be the very crown and culmination of the gospel, had greatly offended his hearers of all kinds, and on distinct grounds. In the words that follow a touch of deeper meaning than any which had preceded is supplied when he proceeds to associate this death of the Son of man with the wilful act of the ecclesiastical authorities in Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus therefore said</span> (<span class="accented">unto them</span>), <span class="cmt_word">When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man</span> (compare here notes on John 3:14; 6:62; 12:32). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is used with the twofold sense of exaltation on the cross" signifying by what death he should glorify God" - and also of the issues of that lifting up by means of the tree of ignoble torment and mortal agony to the throne of glory. The twofold meaning of the word cannot be excluded here. <span class="cmt_word">Then ye shall come to</span>  <span class="cmt_word">know</span> - then the process of proof will be completed - <span class="cmt_word">that I am</span> (<span class="cmt_word">he</span>) - that I am that which fundamentally I am declaring to you, that my testimonies have unique but trenchant confirmation - <span class="cmt_word">and that I am doing nothing from myself, but that even as the Father taught me,</span> (so) <span class="cmt_word">these things I speak.</span> The "he that sent me" (ver. 26), is here replaced by "the Father." "The things which I heard from (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) him" is replaced by "even as the Father taught me," and the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span> are repeated. "The cross and the crown" will be the proof to the most obtuse and bigoted "<span class="accented">that I am</span> that which I say I am."
