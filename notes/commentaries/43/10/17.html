Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm" title="But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.">John 5:17</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Philippians 2:8-9</a>. The thought is that in the relation between the Father and the human nature of Christ, the reason of the Father’s love is based upon the self-devotion of the Son. He who so loved the world that he gave His only-begotten Son to die for it, loves the Son who of His own will gives Himself to die. It is, if we might presume so to speak, as though the salvation of mankind had called forth a new relation of love between the Father and the Son.<p><span class= "bld">That I might take it again.</span>—This is given as part of the reason of the Father’s love; and the words admit of no other construction. At first sight they seem to us paradoxical, beyond and against common feeling. In acts of sacrifice, the fact that that which is lost will be certainly regained, seems to us to take away all value from the act; but here the fact that Christ will lay down His life, is stated to be in order that He may take it again; and this is the foundation of the Father’s love! The key to the meaning is in the truth that for Christ the taking again of human life is itself a further sacrifice, and that this is necessary for the completion of the Great Shepherd’s work. The scattered sheep during the whole of the world’s existence are to be gathered in by Him whose continued union with human nature makes Him at once the Shepherd who gives His life for the sheep, and the Door by whom we ever have access to the Father.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:10-18 Christ is a good Shepherd; many who were not thieves, yet were careless in their duty, and by their neglect the flock was much hurt. Bad principles are the root of bad practices. The Lord Jesus knows whom he has chosen, and is sure of them; they also know whom they have trusted, and are sure of Him. See here the grace of Christ; since none could demand his life of him, he laid it down of himself for our redemption. He offered himself to be the Saviour; Lo, I come. And the necessity of our case calling for it, he offered himself for the Sacrifice. He was both the offerer and the offering, so that his laying down his life was his offering up himself. From hence it is plain, that he died in the place and stead of men; to obtain their being set free from the punishment of sin, to obtain the pardon of their sin; and that his death should obtain that pardon. Our Lord laid not his life down for his doctrine, but for his sheep.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I lay down my life - I give myself to die for my people, in Jewish and pagan lands.

Christ was the object of his Father's love from all eternity, and was loved by him on various accounts; first and chiefly, as his own Son, of the same nature with him, equal to him; and also as Mediator, engaging for, and on the behalf of his chosen people; and likewise as he was clothed with their nature, and even in his state of humiliation; and not only as subject to his ordinances, and obedient to his will, and doing what was pleasing in his sight, but likewise as suffering in their room and stead, and he loved him on this account; the bruising of him was a pleasure to him, not for the sake of that itself, but because hereby his counsels and decrees were accomplished, his covenant fulfilled, and the salvation of his people obtained: hence it follows here, <p>because I lay down my life; that is, for the sheep; to ransom them from sin and Satan, the law, its curse and condemnation, and from death and hell, wrath, ruin and destruction: and the laying down his life on this account, was not only well pleasing to his Father, but likewise was done, with the following view; or at least this was the event of it, <p>that I might take it again; as he did, by raising himself from the dead, by which he was declared to be the Son of God; and to have made full satisfaction to divine justice, for the sins of his people, and therefore rose again for their, justification; and to be the victorious conqueror over death, having now abolished it, and having in his hands the keys of it, the power over that, and the grave: and which life he took up again, by his divine power, and as the surety of his people, to use it for their good; by ascending to his God and theirs, entering into heaven as their forerunner, appearing in the presence of God for them, as their advocate, and ever living to make intercession for them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> Therefore doth my Father love me, because <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</span><p>(5) Christ is by the decree of the Father the only true shepherd of the true Church, for he willingly gave his life for his sheep, and by his own power rose again to life.<p>(g) He uses the present tense because Christ's whole life was as it were a perpetual death.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again....">John 10:17-18</a>. Christ’s self-delineation as the Good Shepherd is finished. Jesus now further bears testimony to that which filled His heart, while setting forth this great vocation, which was only to be fulfilled by dying and rising again, namely, <span class="ital">the love of His Father</span>, which rests upon Him just because of that which He has declared concerning Himself as the good shepherd.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>] is to be taken as in all the passages where it occurs in John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-16.htm" title="And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.">John 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm" title="Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.">John 5:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-47.htm" title="He that is of God hears God's words: you therefore hear them not, because you are not of God.">John 8:47</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-18.htm" title="For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.">John 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-39.htm" title="Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,">John 12:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not.">1 John 3:1</a>): <span class="ital">therefore</span>—<span class="ital">because</span>, <span class="ital">namely</span>, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> referring to what had <span class="ital">preceded</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> introducing a more precise explication of <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>. The sense consequently is: <span class="ital">therefore</span>, because of this my relationship as Shepherd, of which I have spoken down to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>, <span class="ital">my Father loves me, because, namely, I</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span>; no other does so or can do so) <span class="ital">lay down my life, in order to take it again</span>. Note in particular: (1) The explanation <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> … <span class="greekheb">μου</span> is pragmatically correct, because it is just the readiness to sacrifice His life which is the main characteristic of the good shepherd (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm" title="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.">John 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-15.htm" title="As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.">John 10:15</a>). (2) <span class="greekheb">ἵνα πάλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λάβω αὐτήν</span> do not belong to <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπ</span>., but express the <span class="ital">intention</span> or <span class="ital">design</span> of <span class="greekheb">τίθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ψ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μου</span> (not merely its <span class="ital">result</span>, as Theodore of Mopsuestia, Euth. Zigabenus, Grotius, and many suppose; or its <span class="ital">condition</span>, as Calvin, De Wette, and several others maintain); for the ground of the love of God lies not merely in the sacrifice considered by itself, but in the fact that the Good Shepherd, when He gives up His life, is resolved to take it again, in order that He may continue to fulfil His pastoral office till the final goal is reached, when all mankind shall constitute His flock. Indeed, only on the condition of His taking His life again, could He fulfil the office of Shepherd unto the final completion contemplated in the divine decree, and referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>. For this reason, also, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> cannot be regarded as introducing the <span class="ital">divine</span> intention (Tholuck), because the ground of the Father’s love must lie in the volition of <span class="ital">Jesus</span>,—which volition, it is true, corresponds to the Father’s will, though this is not here expressly declared, but first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.">John 10:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.">John 10:18</a>. It must be, however, not an <span class="ital">unwilling</span>, but a <span class="ital">voluntary</span> self-sacrifice, if it is to form the ground of the love of the Father to Him; hence the words <span class="greekheb">οὐδεὶς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἐμαυτοῦ</span> (<span class="ital">mea ipsius sponte</span>). Nor must He proceed to effect this voluntary sacrifice of His own authority; but must <span class="ital">receive a warrant thereto</span>, as also for that which He had in view in so doing, viz. the resumption of His life; hence the words: <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαν</span> … <span class="greekheb">λαβεῖν αὐτήν</span>. Nay, more; even <span class="ital">this very thing</span> which He purposed to do, namely, the surrender and resumption of His life, must have come to Him as a <span class="ital">commission</span> from God; hence the expression: <span class="greekheb">ταύτην τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐντολὴν</span> … <span class="greekheb">πατρός μου</span>, in which <span class="greekheb">ταύτην</span> (<span class="ital">this and not something different</span>) is emphatic, and <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐντολὴν</span> is correlate to the idea of <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span>, as this latter is grounded in the divine <span class="ital">mandate</span>. Notice further: (1) The <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span>, the power <span class="ital">conferred</span> (so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-10.htm" title="Then said Pilate to him, Speak you not to me? know you not that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you?">John 19:10</a> f., not <span class="ital">power</span> generally), lies in the relation of subordination to God, of whom the Son is the <span class="ital">commissioned representative</span>, and to whom He submits Himself voluntarily, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. from no compulsion exerted by a power outside of Himself, but with self-determined obedience to the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-30.htm" title="Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.">John 14:30</a> f.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm" title="Think you that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?">Matthew 26:53</a>). Equality of nature (Olshausen) is the presupposition of this moral harmony. (2) The view which pervades the New Testament, that Christ did not raise Himself from the dead, but was raised by the Father, is not affected by this passage, inasmuch as the <span class="ital">taking</span> again of His life, for which the divine-human Christ had received authorization, implies the <span class="ital">giving</span> again of the life, to wit, the re-awakening activity of the Father. This giving again on the part of God, by which Christ becomes <span class="greekheb">ζωοποιηθεὶς πνεύματι</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1 Peter 3:19</a>, and Huther on the passage), and that <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span>, which Christ receives from God, are the two factors of the resurrection—the former being the causa <span class="ital">efficiens</span>, whilst the latter, the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> of Christ, is the causa <span class="ital">apprehendens</span>. Compare <span class="ital">Constitutiones Apostol</span>. 5. 7. 8 : <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτὸν προστάγματι τοῦ πατρὸς διὰ τριῶν ἡμερῶν ἀνεγείρας</span>.—(3) <span class="greekheb">ταύτην τὴν ἐντολ</span>. embraces the aforementioned twofold <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span>; justly so, inasmuch as the authorization to die and to rise again was only formally divided according to its two aspects. Chrysostom and several others erroneously refer <span class="greekheb">ταύτην</span> to the dying alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.">John 10:17</a>. At this point the exposition of the functions of the good shepherd terminates; but as a note or appendix Jesus adds <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>, “on this account,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, because I lay down my life for the sheep (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-15.htm" title="As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.">John 10:15</a> and following clause) does my Father love me. The expressed <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span> serves to bring out the spontaneity of the surrender. And this free sacrifice or death is justified by the object, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα πάλιν λάβω αὐτήν</span>. He dies, not to remain in death and so leave the sheep defenceless, but to live again, to resume life in pursuance of the object for which He had given it. The freedom of the sacrifice is proved by His taking His life again. He was not compelled to die.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">Therefore</span>] Better, <span class="ital">On this account</span>, or, <span class="bld">For this cause</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-18.htm" title="For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.">John 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.">John 12:27</a>). See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-22.htm" title="Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.">John 7:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-47.htm" title="He that is of God hears God's words: you therefore hear them not, because you are not of God.">John 8:47</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-16.htm" title="And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.">John 5:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-18.htm" title="Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.">John 5:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-65.htm" title="And he said, Therefore said I to you, that no man can come to me, except it were given to him of my Father.">John 6:65</a>. The Father’s love for the incarnate Son is intensified by the self-sacrifice of the Son.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that I might take it again</span>] literally, <span class="bld">in order that I may</span> <span class="ital">take it again</span>. This clause is closely connected with the preceding one: ‘that’ depends upon ‘because.’ Only because Christ was to take His human life again was His death such as the Father could have approved. Had the Son returned to heaven at the Crucifixion leaving His humanity on the Cross, the salvation of mankind would not have been won, the sentence of death would not have been reversed, we should be ‘yet in our sins’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-17.htm" title="And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; you are yet in your sins.">1 Corinthians 15:17</a>). Morever, in that case He would have ceased to be the Good Shepherd: He would have become like the hireling, casting aside his duty before it was completed. The office of the True Shepherd is not finished until all mankind become His flock; and this work continues from the Resurrection to the Day of Judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.">John 10:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀγαπᾷ</span>) <span class="ital">loveth</span> Me, and lovingly enjoins this on Me,—lovingly as it were persuades Me, and I, although I must lay down My life, remain sure of His love; for I lay it down, that I may take it up again: moreover the Father, in love to Me, gives Me the sheep as my peculiar portion; because I keep His commandment concerning the laying down of My life; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself.

Coming as an extraneous addition]. The love of the Father is to be kept in sight, in the passion of Christ, not only towards us, but also towards Christ: we are not to look merely to His avenging severity [stern justice].<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> points to the whole of the previous statement, and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> to a more complete exposition of the precise point in it on which the Divine Father's love (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span>) rests. The "I" and "me" refer to the incarnate Son, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the Divine-human Personality of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Father loveth me, <span class="accented">because</span>, not merely <span class="accented">that I lay down my life</span>, for such might be the consequence of helplessness in the presence of victorious and desperate foes. The love which merely "laid down life" would be a Buddha-like self-sacrifice, producing certain moral effects upon the minds of the onlookers, and revealing a large and loving sense of the need of others. Yet in such expression of his sacrificial love he would have relinquished his undertaking. There would have been no more that he could do for his flock, this Shepherd-functions would, in the consummating act, cease, he would be a beautiful Memory, not a living Energy; a glorious Example, not the Author of eternal salvation. He would cease to be the great Shepherd of the sheep. Now the Father's love contemplated more than this, viz. the Lord's own purpose to <span class="accented">take up again that life</span> which he was prepared voluntarily to lay down for the sheep. Thus he would indeed die, that he might be more of a Shepherd to them than he had ever been before. How otherwise would he personally bring the other sheep into his flock, or be known of them, as the Father was known by him? Christ declares that after his death he would still exercise royal rights, be as much a Divine-human Personality as ever. Christ, as a sinless Man, the sinless One, <span class="accented">might</span> indeed, after the victory over the tempter in the wilderness, or from the Mount of Transfiguration, have returned to the spiritual world without accomplishing an exodus on Golgotha, but he chose, he willed, to lay down his life. Having done this much, he might have joined the great majority, and been their Head and Chief, and left his work to be commented on by others. But such a consummation would have fallen far short of the true and sufficing object of the Father's <span class="accented">love</span>. Christ declares that the very end of his death was his resurrection from death. In retaking his life, he is able to continue, on perfectly different terms, the shepherding of his people he becomes in the highest sense, the great Shepherd, the good Shepherd, the archetypal, and the veritable Shepherd of the flock of God. </body></html>
