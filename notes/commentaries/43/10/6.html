The discourse of this chapter differs from the true parable, which is a story in which the outer facts are kept wholly distinct from the ideal truths that are to be taught; whereas here the form and the idea interpenetrate each other at every point. It is so in the other so-called “parable” in this Gospel (John 15). Strictly speaking, neither the “Good Shepherd” nor the “True Vine” is a parable. Both are “allegories,” or rather, they are, as there is every reason to think, allegorical interpretations of actual events in the material world, which are thus made the vehicle of spiritual truths. It will follow from this that the interpretation of every point in the history of the material facts (<span class= "ital">e.g., “</span>the porter” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm" title="To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.">John 10:3</a>) is not always to be pressed. In the parable the story is made to express the spiritual truth, and with greater or lesser fulness every point in it may have its spiritual counterpart. The outer facts which are allegorised exist independently of the spiritual truth. The fact that they express it at some central points is all that is necessary for the allegory, and greater caution should attend the use of any addition to the interpretation which is given.<p><span class= "bld">But they understood not what things they were . . .</span>—They of course understood the outer facts, then passing before their eyes, or, in any case, well known to them. What they did not understand was the spiritual truths underlying these phenomena. They must have known His words had some spiritual meaning. They were accustomed to every form of allegorical teaching, and they could not have thought that He was simply describing to them the everyday events of the shepherd’s life. But they who think that they see (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm" title="Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you should have no sin: but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.">John 9:41</a>) are spiritually blind, and cannot understand the elements of divine truth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-6.htm" title="This parable spoke Jesus to them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them....">John 10:6-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">This parable spake Jesus: but they understood not, </span>&c. — In this symbolical way Jesus taught the Pharisees the difference between true and false teachers; but they did not understand the meaning of what he said: therefore he added, by way of explication, <span class="ital">Verily, verily, I say unto you — </span>I solemnly assure you of it, as an undoubted and most momentous truth; <span class="ital">I am the door of the sheep — </span>That is, the door by which the sheep- fold is entered.

And what greater security has the church of God than that the Lord Jesus is between it and all its enemies? He is a door open for passage and communication. Here are plain directions how to come into the fold; we must come in by Jesus Christ as the Door. By faith in him as the great Mediator between God and man. Also, we have precious promises to those that observe this direction. Christ has all that care of his church, and every believer, which a good shepherd has of his flock; and he expects the church, and every believer, to wait on him, and to keep in his pasture.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This parable - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3</a>.<p>They understood not ... - They did not understand the meaning or design of the illustration. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

It is incorrect, accordingly, with most recent commentators (also Hengstenberg and Godet), to say that we have a second parable with a different turn; if Christ had not intended even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1</a> to describe Himself as the <span class="greekheb">θύρα</span>, He would only have confused His hearers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-7.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.">John 10:7</a>, instead of clearing matters up.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span>] with great emphasis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῶν προβάτων</span>] to the sheep, as is required by <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1</a>; not, through which the sheep enter into the fold (Chrysostom, Euth. Zigabenus, Wolf, Lampe, Fritzsche, Ebrard, Hengstenberg, Baeumlein, Godet, and others), so that Jesus characterizes Himself as the tutorem ac nutritorem of the sheep (Fritzsche). Christ, however, is the door to the sheep, so far as the true spiritual leaders of the people of God receive through Him the qualification and appointment to their vocation. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.">John 10:1</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-6.htm" title="This parable spoke Jesus to them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them.">John 10:6</a>. The application of the parable was sufficiently obvious; but <span class="greekheb">ταύτην</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῖς</span>. <span class="greekheb">παροιμία</span> [<span class="greekheb">παρά</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἶμος</span>, out of the way or wayside] seems more properly to denote “a proverb”; and the Book of Proverbs is named in the Sept[73] <span class="greekheb">αἱ παροιμίαι</span> or <span class="greekheb">παροιμίαι Σαλωμῶντος</span>; and Aristotle, <span class="ital">Rhetor.</span>, 3, 11, defines <span class="greekheb">παροιμίαι</span>, as <span class="greekheb">μεταφοραὶ απʼ εἴδους επʼ εἶδος</span>. But <span class="greekheb">παροιμία</span> and <span class="greekheb">παραβολή</span> came to be convertible terms, both meaning a longer or shorter utterance whose meaning did not lie on the surface or proverbial sayings: the former term is never found in the Synoptic Gospels, the latter never found in John. [Further see Hatch, <span class="ital">Essays in Bibl. Greek</span>, p. 64; and Abbot’s <span class="ital">Essays</span>, p. 82.] This parable the Pharisees did not understand. They might have understood it, for the terms used were familiar O.T. terms; see Ezekiel 34, Psalms 80. But as it had been spoken for their instruction as well as for the encouragement of the man whom they had cast out of the fold, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-7.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.">John 10:7</a>) <span class="greekheb">εἶπεν οὖν πάλιν</span>, Jesus therefore began afresh and explained it to them.—<span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ εἰμι ἡ θύρα τῶν πρόβατων</span>. I, and no other, am the door of the sheep. [<span class="ital">Cf.</span> the Persian reformer who proclaimed himself the “Bâb,” the gate of life.] Through me alone can the sheep find access to the fold. Primarily uttered for the excommnuicated man, these words conveyed the assurance that instead of being outcast by his attachment to Jesus he had gained admittance to the fellowship of God and all good men. Not the Pharisees but Jesus could admit to or reject from the fold of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[73] Septuagint.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">This parable</span>] Better, <span class="ital">This</span> <span class="bld">allegory</span>.

The Pharisees were conscious of neither need, nor blindness, nor desire of salvation, nor of the Shepherd's care or grace. They will not go to him for life. They can make nothing of his enigmatic words. They take counsel against him. Their misconception contrasts strongly with the susceptibility of the broken-hearted penitents.
