Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm" title="I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.">John 10:14</a>. We have no better word in English; but “excellent,” “distinguished,” approach the sense. It is not the nature of the works as beneficent that is made prominent, but their moral excellence. They are works from the Father manifested in the visible world by the Son. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.">John 5:19-20</a>.) Jesus speaks of “many” such works. John has recorded but few, but he has given hints that many more were done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-2.htm" title="The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.">John 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a>), and he afterwards expressly asserts this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-30.htm" title="And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:">John 20:30</a>).<p><span class= "bld">For which of those works do ye stone me?</span>—Again there is a fulness of meaning in the Greek which it is difficult to convey in translation. The word rendered “which” marks, not simple distinction, but quality. (Comp. “What kind of commandment,” Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-36.htm" title="Master, which is the great commandment in the law?">Matthew 22:36</a>.) “What is the character,” our Lord would ask, “of that one of these works on account of which ye are about to stone Me?” If they had thought out this question they must have been led to see that the quality of the works proved that they were from God, and that therefore He by whom they had been wrought, was also from God. This thought of the quality of the works had been in the minds of some of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm" title="Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.">John 9:16</a>). Its true issue would have been to worship Him as God; they are preparing to stone Him as a blasphemer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-32.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do you stone me?...">John 10:32-36</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jesus answered, Many good works have I showed you from my Father </span>— That is, in confirmation of my mission from my Father I have wrought many miracles, all of a beneficent kind, and most becoming the perfections of my Father, who sent me. I have fed the hungry, I have healed the lame, I have cured the sick, I have given sight to the blind, I have cast out devils, and I have raised the dead: <span class="ital">for which of all these </span>are you going <span class="ital">to stone me? The Jews answered, For a good work we stone thee not </span>— We are going to punish thee with death, not for a good work, but for blasphemy; for, though thou art a man, weak and mortal as we ourselves are, thou arrogantly assumest to thyself the power and majesty of God; and by laying claim to the incommunicable attributes of the Deity, makest thyself God. This they took to be the plain meaning of his assertion, that he and the Father were one. <span class="ital">Jesus </span>— Not judging it proper, at that time, to bring the sublime doctrine of his Deity into further debate; <span class="ital">answered them, Is it not written in your law </span>— Or, in those sacred books which you own to be of divine original, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-6.htm" title="I have said, You are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.">Psalm 82:6</a>,) where it is plain the persons that are spoken of are princes and magistrates; <span class="ital">I said, Ye are gods? </span>— “The Jewish magistrates were God’s deputies in an especial manner, because the people whom they governed were his peculiar people, and because, in many instances, they were expressly called by him to undertake the fatigues of government, and had an afflatus, or inspiration of the Spirit, for that end. Thus the high-priests derived their dignity from God, and were possessed of the Urim and Thummim, by which they inquired of the Lord. When Moses chose the seventy elders to assist him in the distribution of justice, God put his Spirit upon them, and they prophesied, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-17.htm" title="And I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you bear it not yourself alone.">Numbers 11:17</a>. Joshua, who succeeded Moses by divine appointment, is said to have been a man in whom was the Spirit, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-18.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him;">Numbers 27:18</a>. Many of the judges were raised up by God, and had his Spirit. When Saul was anointed, the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-6.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD will come on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.">1 Samuel 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-10.htm" title="And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him, and he prophesied among them.">1 Samuel 10:10</a>.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">If he </span>(God) <span class="ital">called them gods, to whom the word of God came </span>— That is, to whom God was then speaking; <span class="ital">and the Scripture cannot be broken </span>— That is, nothing that is written therein can be censured or rejected. Dr. Campbell translates this clause, <span class="ital">And if the language of Scripture is unexceptionable; </span>observing, “Our Lord defends what he had said from the charge of blasphemy, by showing its conformity to the style of Scripture in less urgent cases; insomuch, that if the propriety of Scripture language were admitted, the propriety of his must be admitted also.” “This,” adds he, “is one of those instances wherein, though it is very easy for the translator to discover the meaning, it is very difficult to express it in words which shall appear to correspond to those of his author.” <span class="ital">Say ye of him whom the Father hath</span> <span class="ital">sanctified </span>— Hath set apart for the great work of redeeming and saving the human race; <span class="ital">and sent into the world — </span>For that purpose; <span class="ital">Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God? </span>— If the Scripture, which cannot err, gives the title of gods to mortal and sinful men, why should you reckon guilty of blasphemy, me, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world on so grand a design, because I assume to myself a title which so justly belongs to me, namely, that of <span class="ital">the Son of God? </span>Some set the argument in another light, thus: If they, to whom the word of God, and the revelation of his will came, are called gods in Scripture, how dare you say to the Word of God himself, by whom all the various revelations of the divine will have been made to men; how dare you say to such a person, on such an occasion, <span class="ital">Thou blasphemest! </span>Jesus, it must be observed, was charged here by the Jews with ascribing divinity to his human nature; and in reply to this he shows, that, calling himself <span class="ital">the Son of God, </span>did not imply that, and that his works proved such a union of the human nature with the divine as he had before asserted, than which no answer could have been more wise and pertinent.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:31-38 Christ's works of power and mercy proclaim him to be over all, God blessed for evermore, that all may know and believe He is in the Father, and the Father in Him. Whom the Father sends, he sanctifies. The holy God will reward, and therefore will employ, none but such as he makes holy. The Father was in the Son, so that by Divine power he wrought his miracles; the Son was so in the Father, that he knew the whole of His mind. This we cannot by searching find out to perfection, but we may know and believe these declarations of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Many good works - Many miracles of benevolence healing the sick, etc. His miracles were good works, as they tended to promote the happiness of men, and were proofs of his benevolence. He had performed no other works than those of benevolence; he knew that they could charge him with no other, and he confidently appealed to them as witnesses of that. Happy would it be if all, when they are opposed and persecuted, could appeal even to their persecutors in proof of their own innocence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32.

I have given sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, healed many that were sick of grievous diseases, cast out many devils out of those which were infested with or possessed by them.
