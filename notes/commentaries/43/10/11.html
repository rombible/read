St. John uses the word only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-10.htm" title="And said to him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but you have kept the good wine until now.">John 2:10</a>, of the “good wine,” and in this chapter here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-14.htm" title="I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.">John 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-32.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do you stone me?">John 10:32-33</a>. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-15.htm" title="But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.">Luke 8:15</a>.) The passage of the Old Testament referred to above has prepared our minds for this thought of Christ, especially Psalms 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/34-11.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm" title="And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24</a>. He is the Shepherd who is ideally good, fulfilling every thought of guidance, support, self-sacrifice that had ever gathered round the shepherd’s name. No image of Christ has so deeply impressed itself upon the mind of the Church as this has. We find it in the earliest Christian literature, as in Tertullian (<span class= "ital">Works,</span> vol. i., p. 371, in Ante-Nicene Library), or Clement of Alexandria (<span class= "ital">Works,</span> vol. i., pp. 149, 462, A.N. Lib.). We find it in the very earliest efforts of Christian art, in painting, embroidery, and even statuary. (See Kugler’s <span class= "ital">Handbook, Italian Schools,</span> Lady Eastlake’s Trans., 4th Ed., pp. 5 and 6.) It comes to us naturally in our hymns and prayers. The pastoral staff is the fit emblem of the Bishop’s work, and the Pastor is the name by which the humble way-side flock thinks of him who in Christ’s name is appointed to be their guide.<p><span class= "bld">Giveth his life for the sheep.</span>—This was true of the actual shepherds, of whose devoted bravery many instances are told. A striking one is that of David himself who rescued the lamb of his father’s flock from the mouth of the lion and the bear (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/17-34.htm" title="And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:">1Samuel 17:34-37</a>). That self-sacrifice that would lead the shepherd to risk his own life for that of his flock has its ideal fulfilment in Him who is the Good Shepherd, and will give His life for mankind. The word rendered “giveth is life,” should be almost certainly <span class= "ital">layeth down His life.</span> They are found only in St. John’s writings. The other passages are <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-15.htm" title="As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.">John 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.">John 10:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-37.htm" title="Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now?

The wolf signifies an enemy who by force or fraud attacks the Christian’s faith, liberty, or life. Observe, reader, it is not the bare receiving hire, which denominates a man a <span class="ital">hireling, </span>(for the <span class="ital">labourer is worthy of his hire, </span>Jesus Christ himself being judge: yea, <span class="ital">and the Lord hath ordained that they who preach the gospel should live by the gospel,</span>) but the <span class="ital">loving </span>hire; the loving the hire more than the work; the working <span class="ital">for the sake </span>of the hire. He is a hireling who would not work were it not for the hire; to whom this is the great, if not only, motive of working. O God! if a man who works only <span class="ital">for hire </span>is such a wretch, a mere <span class="ital">thief and a robber; </span>what is he who continually takes the hire, and yet does not work at all! <span class="ital">The hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling </span>— Because he loves the hire, not the sheep; and takes the work upon him merely for the wages he is to receive. From what our Lord here says, it plainly appears to be the duty of every minister of the gospel, intrusted with the care of a flock, to reside ordinarily among them. For, if approaching danger to himself, or them, is no excuse for his fleeing away and leaving them, far less will interest, or pleasure, or any lesser matter, be an excuse for such unfaithfulness. <span class="ital">I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep </span>— With a tender regard and special care. Being the good shepherd, and the owner of the sheep, I pay such earnest and constant attention to my flock, and take such care of it, that I not only know every particular sheep, but I know every thing relating to each. I know the circumstance, wherein they are placed, am well acquainted with their wants, and can judge what aids they stand in need of. Besides, I love them all with an ardent affection, and approve of their obedience to me, because, though it is imperfect, it is sincere. <span class="ital">And am known of mine </span>— With a holy confidence and affection. As I know, love, and approve my sheep, so I am known and beloved of them in return, for they have just apprehensions of my dignity and character; in particular, they know that I am their Shepherd and Saviour, sent from God, and that I am able to feed them with knowledge, and to deliver them from the punishment of sin, and to bestow on them everlasting life. <span class="ital">As the Father knoweth me, </span>&c. — That is, <span class="ital">I know my sheep, and am known of mine, even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; </span>for so the passage ought to be rendered, and construed in connection with the foregoing verse; as if he had said, The mutual knowledge subsisting between me and my sheep, is like that which subsists between the Father and me. It is a knowledge which implies an inexpressible union. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/17-21.htm" title="That they all may be one; as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that you have sent me....">John 17:21-22</a>. <span class="ital">And I lay down my life for the sheep </span>— He speaks of the present time: for his whole life was only a going unto death. I show the greatness of the love which I bear to my sheep by dying for them, which no hireling did, or ever will do.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:10-18 Christ is a good Shepherd; many who were not thieves, yet were careless in their duty, and by their neglect the flock was much hurt. Bad principles are the root of bad practices. The Lord Jesus knows whom he has chosen, and is sure of them; they also know whom they have trusted, and are sure of Him. See here the grace of Christ; since none could demand his life of him, he laid it down of himself for our redemption. He offered himself to be the Saviour; Lo, I come. And the necessity of our case calling for it, he offered himself for the Sacrifice. He was both the offerer and the offering, so that his laying down his life was his offering up himself. From hence it is plain, that he died in the place and stead of men; to obtain their being set free from the punishment of sin, to obtain the pardon of their sin; and that his death should obtain that pardon. Our Lord laid not his life down for his doctrine, but for his sheep.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The good shepherd - The faithful and true shepherd, willing to do all that is necessary to defend and save the flock.<p>Giveth his life - A shepherd that regarded his flock would hazard his own life to defend them.

I am the good shepherd&#8212;emphatically, and, in the sense intended, exclusively so (Isa 40:11; Eze 34:23; 37:24; Zec 13:7).<p>the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep&#8212;Though this may be said of literal shepherds, who, even for their brute flock, have, like David, encountered "the lion and the bear" at the risk of their own lives, and still more of faithful pastors who, like the early bishops of Rome, have been the foremost to brave the fury of their enemies against the flock committed to their care; yet here, beyond doubt, it points to the struggle which was to issue in the willing surrender of the Redeemer's own life, to save His sheep from destruction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That good Shepherd prophesied of, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a></span>. I cannot agree with those who think that Christ here speaketh not of himself as <span class="bld">the good Shepherd, </span> with reference to his office, as he was the Messiah, but only in opposition to the hirelings after mentioned.

Our Saviour therefore, doubtless, in this place showeth wherein he was the most excellent Shepherd, far excelling the best shepherds in the world, because he was come, not only to expose, hazard, and adventure his life, but actually, willingly, and freely to lay it down. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I am the good shepherd,.... A shepherd of his Father's appointing, calling, and sending, to whom the care of all his sheep, or chosen ones, was committed; who was set up as a shepherd over them by him, and was entrusted with them; and who being called, undertook to feed them; and being promised, was sent unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel; and under the character of a shepherd, died for them, and rose again, and is accountable to his Father for everyone of them; the shepherd, the great and chief shepherd, the famous one, so often spoken and prophesied of, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>. And discharging his office aright, he is the good shepherd; as appears in his providing good pasture, and a good fold for his sheep; in protecting them from their enemies; in healing all their diseases; in restoring their souls when strayed from him; in watching over them in the night seasons, lest any hurt them; in searching for them, when they have been driven, or scattered in the dark and cloudy day; in caring for them, so that he lose none of them; and in nothing more than in what follows, <p>the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep: not only exposes it to danger, as David did his, for the sake of his father's flock, but gives it away freely and voluntarily, for the sake of the sheep; in their room and stead, as a ransom for them, that they may be delivered from death, and might have eternal life: the Ethiopic version renders it, "the good shepherd gives his life for the redemption of his sheep"; so Nonnus paraphrases it, the "ransom price of his own sheep": this belongs to Christ's priestly office, and with the Jews priests were sometimes shepherds hence we read (q) of , "shepherds that were priests". Philo the Jew speaks (r) of God as a shepherd and king; and of his setting his word, his firstborn Son, over the holy flock, to take care of it: and a good shepherd is thus described by the (s) Jews; <p>"as , "a good shepherd", delivers the flock from the wolf, and from the lions, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a>) so he that leads Israel, if he is good, delivers them from the idolatrous nations, and from judgment below and above, and leads them to the life of the world to come, or eternal life; (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).'' <p>Which description agrees with Christ, the good shepherd; and so the Lord is said to be , "the good shepherd", and merciful, and there is none like him (t). <p>(q) Misn.

In these verses Jesus designates Himself “the Good Shepherd” and emphasises two features by which a good shepherd can be known: (1) his giving his life for the sheep, and (2) the reciprocal knowledge of the sheep and the shepherd. These two features are both introduced by the statement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm" title="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.">John 10:11</a>) <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ποιμὴν ὁ καλός</span>, “the good shepherd”; “good” probably in the sense in which we speak of a “good” painter or a “good” architect; one who excels at his business.

Christ is the Perfect Shepherd, as opposed to His own imperfect ministers; He is the true Shepherd, as opposed to the false shepherds, who are hirelings or hypocrites; He is the Good Shepherd, who gives His life for the sheep, as opposed to the wicked thief who takes their lives to preserve his own. Thus in Christ is realised the ideal Shepherd of O.T. Psalms 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm" title="He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with young.">Isaiah 40:11</a>; Jeremiah 23; Ezekiel 34, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-7.htm" title="And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. And I took to me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.">Zechariah 11:7</a>. Perhaps no image has penetrated more deeply into the mind of Christendom: Christian prayers and hymns, Christian painting and statuary, and Christian literature are full of it, and have been from the earliest ages. And side by side with it is commonly found the other beautiful image of this Gospel, the Vine: the Good Shepherd and the True Vine are figures of which Christians have never wearied.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">giveth his life</span>] Better, <span class="bld">layeth down</span> <span class="ital">His life</span>. The phrase is a remarkable one and peculiar to S. John, whereas ‘to <span class="ital">give</span> His life’ occurs in the Synoptists (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-20.htm" title="Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.">Matthew 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-45.htm" title="For even the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Mark 10:45</a>). ‘To <span class="ital">lay</span> down’ perhaps includes the notion of ‘to <span class="ital">pay</span> down,’ a common meaning of the words in classical Greek; if so, it is exactly equivalent to the Synoptic phrase ‘to give as a <span class="ital">ransom</span>.’ It occurs again, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-15.htm" title="As the Father knows me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.">John 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm" title="Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.">John 10:17</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-37.htm" title="Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake....">John 13:37-38</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-13.htm" title="Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.">John 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1 John 3:16</a>. In this country the statement ‘the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep’ seems extravagant when taken apart from the application to Christ. It is otherwise in the East, where dangers from wild beasts and armed bands of robbers are serious and constant. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-5.htm" title="And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.">Genesis 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-12.htm" title="And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelled in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.">Genesis 14:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/31-39.htm" title="That which was torn of beasts I brought not to you; I bore the loss of it; of my hand did you require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night....">Genesis 31:39-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/32-7.htm" title="Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;...">Genesis 32:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-33.htm" title="And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.">Genesis 37:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-17.htm" title="While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell on the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.">Job 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/17-34.htm" title="And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:...">1 Samuel 17:34-35</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm" title="I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.">John 10:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ποιμὴν ὁ καλός</span>, <span class="ital">the Good Shepherd</span>) He, concerning whom it was foretold by the prophets. The Shepherd, whose peculiar property the sheep are: <span class="ital">good</span>, as being the One who lays down His life for the sheep; also as being He to whom they are an object of care, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-13.htm" title="The hireling flees, because he is an hireling, and cares not for the sheep.">John 10:13</a>, “The hireling <span class="ital">careth</span> not for the sheep.” In our day, they who tend for pay the flocks of one town, or one village, are called pastors; but in this passage the signification of the term, <span class="ital">pastor</span>, is more noble. [<span class="ital">The whole and complete office of Christ is contained in this parabolic discourse concerning</span> the pastor and the door.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">τίθησιν</span>, <span class="ital">lays down</span>) This is five times said, thereby there being expressed the greatest force. In this, the highest benefit, all the remaining benefits conferred by the Shepherd are presupposed, included, and are to be inferred [<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm" title="Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he has put him to grief: when you shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.">Isaiah 53:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm" title="All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.">Isaiah 53:6</a>, When Thou shall make His soul an offering for sin, He shall <span class="ital">see His seed</span>, He shall prolong His clays, and the <span class="ital">pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand</span>: All we like <span class="ital">sheep</span> have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way: and the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all],—<span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῶν προβάτων</span>, <span class="ital">for the sheep</span>) Christ here declares what kind of a shepherd He evinces Himself towards the sheep: for which reason, it cannot be inferred from this, that He did not die also for the rest of men.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-21.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">The functions and responsibilities of the veritable Shepherd</span>, <span class="accented">and the relation of the Shepherd to the flock</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am the good Shepherd</span>. The word here rendered "good" means more than the "true" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) or the" veritable" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); more than <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, good, in the sense of being morally excellent and inwardly fulfilling God's purpose that the sheep should be shepherded. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> suggests a "goodness" that is conspicuous, that shows and approves itself to the experience and observation of all. Thus the Lord fills up the meaning of the first parable by emphasizing another element in it. There may be many shepherds worthy of the name, but he alone justifies the designation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23</a>.). This imagery has inwrought itself into Christian literature and art. The earliest representations of Christ in the catacombs depict him as "the good Shepherd" (Tertullian, 'De Fuga.,' c. 11; Hermas, 'Sire.,' 6:2); the earliest hymns and latest minstrelsy of the Church dwell fondly on the image which portrays his individual watchfulness, his tender care, his self-sacrificing love. <span class="cmt_word">The good Shepherd layeth</span> <span class="cmt_word">down his life for the sheep</span>; not only does his work with his life in his hand, but he deliberately lays down his life and consciously divests himself of his life, and is doing it now. The Shepherd dies that the sheep may live (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>). Elsewhere Jesus says, "The Son of man gives his life a ransom for many" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>). The thought is very grand, and is a strange addition to the claim to be the Shepherd of Israel, and gives intense pathos to the language of our Lord to Simon Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-6.htm">John 21:6</a>), "Shepherd my sheep." The further development of the parable shows that in the metaphor he regards his death as no disastrous termination of the Shepherd's function, but as an event in his career. Hence it is not just of Reuse ('Theol. Chretien,' 2.) to contend that our Lord does not here suggest a vicarious or propitiatory death on his part. This is a veritable death, which secures the life of the sheep, and does not arrest the Shepherd's care (see vers. 17, 18). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The good shepherd (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Literally, the shepherd the good (shepherd). &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;, though not of frequent occurrence in John, is more common than &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, good, which occurs but four times and three times out of the four in the neuter gender, a good thing, or that which is good. &#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; in John is applied to wine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-10.htm">John 2:10</a>), three times to the shepherd in this chapter, and twice to works (<a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-32.htm">John 10:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>). In classical usage, originally as descriptive of outward form, beautiful; of usefulness, as a fair haven, a fair wind. Auspicious, as sacrifices. Morally beautiful, noble; hence virtue is called &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;. The New Testament usage is similar. Outwardly fair, as the stones of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-5.htm">Luke 21:5</a>): well adapted to its purpose, as salt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-50.htm">Mark 9:50</a>): competent for an office, as deacons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-6.htm">1 Timothy 4:6</a>); a steward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>); a soldier (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3</a>): expedient, wholesome (<a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-45.htm">Mark 9:45</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-47.htm">Mark 9:47</a>): morally good, noble, as works (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>); conscience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-18.htm">Hebrews 13:18</a>). The phrase it is good, i.e., a good or proper thing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-21.htm">Romans 14:21</a>). In the Septuagint &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; is the most usual word for good as opposed to evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-15.htm">Luke 8:15</a>, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; and &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; are found together as epithets of the heart; honest (or virtuous, noble) and good. The epithet &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;, applied here to the shepherd, points to the essential goodness as nobly realized, and appealing to admiring respect and affection. As Canon Westcott observes, "in the fulfillment of His work, the Good Shepherd claims the admiration of all that is generous in man."<p>Giveth his life (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>The phrase is peculiar to John, occurring in the Gospel and First Epistle. It is explained in two ways: either (1) as laying down as a pledge, paying as a price, according to the classical usage of the word &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;. So Demosthenes, to pay interest or the alien tax. Or (2) according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4</a>, as laying aside his life like a garment. The latter seems preferable. &#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;, in the sense of to pay down a price, does not occur in the New Testament, unless this phrase, to lay down the life, be so explained. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4</a>, layeth aside His garments (&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;) is followed, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-12.htm">John 13:12</a>, by had taken His garments (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;). So, in this chapter, giveth (&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) His life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), and I lay down (&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;) my life (<a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>), are followed by &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; "to take it again." The phrases &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; He laid down His life, and &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to lay down our lives, occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm">1 John 3:16</a>. The verb is used in the sense of laying aside in the classics, as to lay aside war, shields, etc. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;, to give His life.<p>For the sheep (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3c1;)<p>On behalf of. </body></html>
