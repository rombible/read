Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.">John 1:28</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;">Matthew 19:1</a> we have the fuller expression, “the coasts of Judæa beyond Jordan,” referring to the same locality. The whole of Judæa proper was Cis-Jordanic, and the “Judah upon Jordan” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-34.htm" title="And then the coast turns westward to Aznothtabor, and goes out from there to Hukkok, and reaches to Zebulun on the south side, and reaches to Asher on the west side, and to Judah on Jordan toward the sun rise.">Joshua 19:34</a>) was the boundary “toward the sun-rising” of the tribe of Naphthali—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> it answered to what was afterwards known as Gaulonitis, and is now known as the <span class= "ital">Jolan.</span> Josephus [<span class= "ital">Wars,</span> iii. 3) expressly enumerates Gaulonitis as belonging to Judæa in the time of our Lord. For the explanation of this spread of the name, which has always been a geographical crux, see von Raumer’s argument in Dr. Caspari’s summary (<span class= "ital">Chron. and Geogr., Introd.,</span> Eng. Trans., p. 90). We have to think, then, probably of Bethania or <span class= "ital">Tellanihje,</span> to the north of the Sea of Galilee, on the eastern side of the Jordan, as the place of our Lord’s retirement. He had taught the Jews by divine words, and they had sought to stone Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-31.htm" title="Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.">John 10:31</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm" title="Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the middle of them, and so passed by.">John 8:59</a>). He had appealed to divine works, and they had attempted to take Him by force (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-39.htm" title="Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,">John 10:39</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-30.htm" title="Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.">John 7:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-32.htm" title="The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.">John 7:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-44.htm" title="And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.">John 7:44</a>). He sees in all this the darkness which foreshadows the night, and He retires from the city to visit it no more until the final Passover, when the night will be at hand. “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!”<p><span class= "bld">And there he abode.</span>—How long we have no means of judging. The time from Dedication to Passover (December to April) is divided, by the visit to Bethany near Jerusalem, and the raising of Lazarus, into two parts of uncertain duration, one of which is spent in Gaulonitis and the other in Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm" title="Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went there to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.">John 11:54</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-40.htm" title="And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he stayed....">John 10:40-42</a></span>. <span class="ital">And, </span>presently departing from Jerusalem, <span class="ital">he went again beyond Jordan </span>— Into Perea, a country for the most part desert and rocky; <span class="ital">the place where John at first baptized </span>— Called Bethabara, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.">John 1:28</a>; <span class="ital">and there he abode </span>— Probably till he came into Judea, to raise Lazarus from the dead, that being the next particular mentioned by this evangelist. If so, the time of his abode in these parts must have been considerable: and, as appears from what follows, was not spent there in vain. For <span class="ital">many </span>of the inhabitants of that place, who had been formerly acquainted with John the Baptist, and remembered the strong and repeated testimonies which he had borne to Jesus, <span class="ital">resorted unto him </span>— To attend his ministry; <span class="ital">and said, John did no miracle </span>— For it seems John was not endued with the power of working miracles, that the authority of Jesus might be more conspicuous and unquestionable; <span class="ital">but all things that John spake of this man were true</span> — The character which John gave of one that was to come after him, is completely verified by the doctrine and miracles of this person. <span class="ital">And many believed on him there </span>— Believed him to be the Messiah, the Son of God. And thus they happily improved this season of Christ’s recess among them, as the means of their instruction, and establishment in piety. Thus we see the testimony of John the Baptist was recollected to excellent purposes, while he himself was mouldering in his tomb. And what can a faithful minister account a greater happiness, or more earnestly desire, than that, even while he is dead, he may yet speak for the honour of Christ, and the salvation of souls? <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:39-42 No weapon formed against our Lord Jesus shall prosper. He escaped, not because he was afraid to suffer, but because his hour was not come. And He who knew how to deliver himself, knows how to deliver the godly our of their temptations, and to make a way for them to escape. Persecutors may drive Christ and his gospel our of their own city or country, but they cannot drive him or it out of the world.

The hostility of the hierarchy being invincible and becoming more and more dangerous Jesus retires into Peraea for quiet and safety before His Passion. This interval was between three and four months, from the latter part of December to the middle of April. But some portion of this time was spent at Ephraim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm" title="Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went there to a country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.">John 11:54</a>) after going to Bethany in Judaea to raise Lazarus.

No forger would ever have thought of the periphrasis ‘where John at first baptized’ … ‘John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.’ It would be impossible to find a stronger incidental proof that the author of the Gospel had been originally a disciple of the Baptist, or at least his contemporary, and also that he is writing of things that he had heard and seen. A Gnostic, writing in Asia Minor, even though he had come into relation with disciples of John, would not have introduced the Baptist in this way. In circles that had been affected by the Baptist’s teaching, and were hesitating whether they should attach themselves to Jesus, this is precisely the sort of comment that would be heard.” S. p. 179.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-40.htm" title="And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he stayed.">John 10:40</a>.[292] <span class="greekheb">Ἰωάννης</span>, <span class="ital">John</span>) The posthumous fruits of the services of John.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[292] <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀπῆλθε</span>, <span class="ital">and went away</span>) Immediately after the Feast of Dedication; as is evident from the omission of the phrase <span class="greekheb">μετὰ ταῦτα</span>, and of the name of Jesus.
