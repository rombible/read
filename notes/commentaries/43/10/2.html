The original expression is manifestly intended to denote the constant, not the peculiar, use which the shepherd makes of the door, as opposed to the constant use of thieves and robbers, to force their entrance by breaking or climbing over the fence. The comparison is made, not to the folds used by the common people in remote parts of the country, but to those belonging to the rich in the neighbourhood of a populous city, where the walls and other fences need to be stronger, and the entrance more carefully kept, on account of the greater danger from thieves.” — Campbell. <span class="ital">To him the porter openeth — </span>As the shepherd will always choose to enter in by that which is the regular appointed way, so, as soon as he approaches, the door-keeper opens the fold; that is, God in his providence, and by the influence of his Spirit, makes way for such a one to exercise his ministry among his people, and gives success to it. For as it is not unworthy of Christ to be styled <span class="ital">the door, </span>by which both the sheep and the true pastors enter, so neither is it unworthy of God the Father to be styled <span class="ital">the door-keeper. </span>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-27.htm" title="And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.">Acts 14:27</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-14.htm" title="And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended to the things which were spoken of Paul.">Acts 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-8.htm" title="I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it: for you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.">Revelation 3:8</a>. It was supposed by Sir Isaac Newton, that as the words were spoken near the temple, where sheep were kept in folds to be sold for sacrifices, Christ here alludes to what was peculiar in those folds; that as they were kept locked, they not only excluded the thief, but the shepherd, till the door-keeper opened them. “But I cannot think,” says Dr. Doddridge, “whatever occasion Christ might take from the sight of sheep to represent his people under that image, and himself as a shepherd, he would describe them like sheep shut up in a pen to be sold for sacrifice: nor does the <span class="ital">shepherd’s leading them out, </span>&c., agree with this circumstance. In countries where there were so many savage beasts, it might be ordinarily necessary to have the folds better secured than among us; and the chief shepherd might often leave a servant to watch them while thus shut up, and come himself to lead them out to pasture in the morning.” <span class="ital">And the sheep hear his voice </span>— The people of God, knowing him to be a true pastor, hearken unto him. All the circumstances here mentioned exactly agree with the customs of the ancient eastern shepherds. They <span class="ital">called </span>their <span class="ital">sheep by name, went before </span>them, and the sheep <span class="ital">followed </span>them. So real Christians hear, attend to, understand, and obey the voice of a shepherd whom Christ hath sent: and he counteth them <span class="ital">his own, </span>dearer than any friend or brother; <span class="ital">calleth them by name </span>— That is, instructs, advises, directs, encourages each by name, and leadeth them out in the paths of righteousness, beside the waters of comfort. <span class="ital">And when he putteth forth his own sheep </span>— Leads them out into the pastures of the ordinances, invites them to the enjoyment of the privileges, and urges them to the practice of the duties of true Christianity; <span class="ital">he goeth before them </span>— In all these particulars, and in all the ways of God, teaching them in every point by example, as well as by precept; <span class="ital">and the sheep follow him </span>— They tread in his steps; <span class="ital">for they know his voice </span>— Having the witness in themselves, that his words are the <span class="ital">truth, </span>the <span class="ital">wisdom, </span>and the <span class="ital">power of God. </span>Reader, art thou a shepherd of souls? Then answer to God: is it thus with thee and thy flock? <span class="ital">And a stranger will they not follow </span>— One whom Christ hath not sent, who does not answer the preceding description. Him <span class="ital">they will not follow; </span>and who can constrain them to it? <span class="ital">But will flee from him </span>— As from the plague. <span class="ital">For they know not the voice of strangers </span>— They cannot relish it. It is harsh and grating to them. They find nothing of God therein. In other words, as sheep will not follow a strange shepherd, so the people of God will not hearken to false teachers, or to such as do not declare, plainly, fully, and with a divine unction, the very word of the truth of the gospel: but will avoid them, for they can easily distinguish them from the true messengers of God by their fruits, that is, by their doctrine and practice, and the inefficacy of their preaching to convert, sanctify, and save the souls of men.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 Here is a parable or similitude, taken from the customs of the East, in the management of sheep. Men, as creatures depending on their Creator, are called the sheep of his pasture. The church of God in the world is as a sheep-fold, exposed to deceivers and persecutors. The great Shepherd of the sheep knows all that are his, guards them by his providence, guides them by his Spirit and word, and goes before them, as the Eastern shepherds went before their sheep, to set them in the way of his steps. Ministers must serve the sheep in their spiritual concerns. The Spirit of Christ will set before them an open door. The sheep of Christ will observe their Shepherd, and be cautious and shy of strangers, who would draw them from faith in him to fancies about him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that entereth by the door - This was the way in which a shepherd had access to his flock.

For this he is said to be sent; and often makes himself known to us under the notion of him whom the Father hath sent. And the under shepherds must also derive from Christ: as the Father’s will in sending Christ was his door, so the will of Christ in sending others is their door; that is, their only true way of entering upon the charge of the flock of Christ. <span class="ital">As my</span> <span class="ital">Father hath sent me, even so send I you, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.">John 20:21</a></span>.

Whosoever entereth into any place in the church, for the feeding and governing of it, that way which God hath directed in his word, he entereth in by the door, he is the true shepherd. Concerning Christ’s title, and his way of entrance, and the first preachers of the gospel, immediately sent by Christ, and declared to be sent by the effusion of the Spirit in the days of Pentecost, there can be no question made by any who believeth the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament. This text declares, that whosoever cometh into the church with right, and as a true shepherd to it, must come in at the door, by a call from God, (as Christ was sent), or from Christ; either by an extraordinary mission, or in such a method and order as Christ hath in his word directed, either from his own month, or by the mouths of his apostles, whom he, ascending up into heaven, left in the first charge of his church. This is that which every one ought in the first place to look after. We shall observe in God’s whole course with his church, that in the corruption of the state of the church, when it was eminently deviated from the rule he had set, he sent some by an extraordinary mission. Such were the prophets, whose writings make up a part of Scripture. Such were the apostles, and first ministers of the gospel. Such, we say, were our first reformers in Germany, and other parts: nor is it any prejudice to it, that they were able to work no miracles; we read of no miracles wrought by the prophets of old, unless by two or three of them. Their faithful declaring the will of God, and calling men back to the plain law of God in a time when the generality were obviously departed from it; together with their spirit of courage and boldness in their work, was evidence enough that God had sent them. But this text only declareth this general truth, That every true shepherd coming into the church, must come in the right way, by the door. So the great Shepherd of the sheep did, being sent by his Father, whose the church is, to take care of it: so must all inferior shepherds do, by him whom God the Father hath made the door; according to whose directions all the affairs of the church must be ordered. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But he that entereth in by the door,....

It has been incorrectly maintained (by Bengel, Luthardt, Hengstenberg, and others), that although <span class="greekheb">ἰδία</span> is first associated with <span class="greekheb">πρόβατα</span> when it occurs for the second time, the <span class="greekheb">πρόβατα</span> which hear must necessarily be the same as those which are afterwards described as <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἴδια πρόβατα</span>.

Thus the particular Church belongs to the Universal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[61] Similarly even Luther: “It denotes the Christian freedom from the law and judgment.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-2.htm" title="But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.">John 10:2</a>. On the other hand, <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ εἰσερχόμενος</span> … <span class="greekheb">προβάτων</span>, “but he that entereth by the door is shepherd of the sheep”. The shepherd is known by his using the legitimate mode of entrance. What that is, He does not here explicitly state. The shepherd is further recognised by his treatment of the sheep, <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἴδια πρόβατα καλεῖ</span> [better <span class="greekheb">φωνεῖ</span>] <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ὄνομα</span>, “his own sheep he calls by name”. <span class="greekheb">ἴδια</span> perhaps as distinguished from others in the same fold; perhaps merely a strong possessive. As we have names for horses, dogs, cows, so the Eastern shepherds for their sheep. [“Many of the sheep have particular names,” Van Lennep, <span class="ital">Bible Lands</span>, i. 189. It was also a Greek custom to name sheep, and Wetstein quotes from Longus, <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ Δάφνις ἐκάλεσέ τινας αὐτῶν ὀνομαστί</span>]—<span class="greekheb">ὅταν</span> … <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>. When he has put all his own out of the fold, they follow him, because they know his voice: the shepherd walking in front as is still the custom in the East. This method cannot be adopted by strangers “because the sheep know not the voice of strangers”. “There is a story of a Scotch traveller who changed clothes with a Jerusalem shepherd and tried to lead the sheep; but the sheep followed the shepherd’s voice and not his clothes.” Plummer. So that the shepherd’s claim is justified not only by his method of entrance but by his Knowledge of the names of the individual sheep and by their knowledge of him and confidence in him. The different methods are illustrated in Andrewes and Laud, the former saying “Our guiding must be mild and gentle, else it is not <span class="ital">duxisti</span>, but <span class="ital">traxisti</span>, drawing and driving and no leading”; the latter, of whom it was said that he “would never convince an opponent if he could suppress him”.

There is more than one flock in the fold, and therefore more than one shepherd to visit the fold. The Good Shepherd has not yet appeared in the allegory. The allegory indeed is two-fold; in the first part (1–5), which is repeated (7–9), Christ is the Door of the fold; in the second part (11–18) He is the Shepherd; <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm" title="The thief comes not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.">John 10:10</a></span> forming a link between the two parts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-2.htm" title="But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.">John 10:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ δὲ εἰσερχόμενος</span>, <span class="ital">but he who enters</span>) through Christ: <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-9.htm" title="I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.">John 10:9</a>, “The door.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he that enters in by the door is a shepherd of the sheep</span>. Let him be who he may, Pharisee or priest, prophet or king, pastor or evangelist, unless he approach the sheep by the right "way" he demeans and condemns himself. If he come by the door into the fold, he may be so far presumably a shepherd. One fold might contain several flocks, and a shepherd might lead these flocks into different enclosures according to his wisdom and care for his sheep. Neander, Godet, and Watkins think it possible that the whole imagery may have been borrowed from the eye. The shepherds towards evening were probably gathering their scattered flocks, according to Oriental custom, into their well-known enclosures, and Jesus with his audience might have seen them doing it if they gazed out from the courts of the temple over the neighboring hills (see also Thomson, 'The Land and the Book,' 1:301, a passage which provides an admirable commentary on this parable). There is no absolute need that the customary and well-known habit of the country-side should have been visible at the moment. The abundantly attested practice furnished to his hearers all needful corroboration. The deeper significance of the passage lies in the prophetic symbolism of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-52.htm">Psalm 78:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>. Jehovah was the Shepherd of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>), and he would appoint once more in their Messiah-King a David, who should be his gracious Representative and Agent. All these representations were gathered up in Christ's wonderful parable of the lost sheep (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-3.htm">Luke 15:3-7</a>). Thoma endeavors to credit the author of the Gospel with this ideal picture of the contrast between the true and false shepherd. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The shepherd (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>Better, a shepherd.
