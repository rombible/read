It was a great trial to Mary, that the body was gone. Weak believers often make that the matter of complaint, which is really just ground of hope, and matter of joy. It is well when those more honoured than others with the privileges of disciples, are more active than others in the duty of disciples; more willing to take pains, and run hazards, in a good work. We must do our best, and neither envy those who can do better, nor despise those who do as well as they can, though they come behind. The disciple whom Jesus loved in a special manner, and who therefore in a special manner loved Jesus, was foremost. The love of Christ will make us to abound in every duty more than any thing else. He that was behind was Peter, who had denied Christ. A sense of guilt hinders us in the service of God. As yet the disciples knew not the Scripture; they Christ must rise again from the dead.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For an account of the resurrection of Christ, see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28.htm">Matthew 28</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-10. Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came first to the sepulchre&#8212;These particulars have a singular air of artless truth about them. Mary, in her grief, runs to the two apostles who were soon to be so closely associated in proclaiming the Saviour's resurrection, and they, followed by Mary, hasten to see with their own eyes. The younger disciple outruns the older; love haply supplying swifter wings. He stoops, he gazes in, but enters not the open sepulchre, held back probably by a reverential fear. The bolder Peter, coming up, goes in at once, and is rewarded with bright evidence of what had happened.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> John stooped down and looked into the sepulchre, and saw the linen clothes lying, but he would not adventure to go in. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he stooping down and looking in,....

It was a necessary preliminary of the subsequent act of Peter, though Luke does not refer to it. Peter himself uses the same word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>).

If so, then Peter, before he came to the conclusion that there was no death in the sepulcher, broke a ritual law which John respected. There seems also rabbinical authority for the fact that disciples might carry "the just" to their grave without such tear of pollution.
