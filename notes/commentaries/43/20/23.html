Assuming what has there been said, it will be sufficient to add that this power is here immediately connected with the representative character of the disciples as apostles sent by Christ, as He was Himself sent by the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.">John 20:21</a>), and that its validity is dependent upon their reception of the Holy Ghost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-22.htm" title="And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:">John 20:22</a>), by whom Christ Himself is present in them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/16-7.htm" title="Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send him to you.">John 16:7-11</a>). Sent as He was sent, they are not sent to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved; but in their work, as in His, men are condemned because the light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather than light.<p>The ultimate principles upon which this power rests are those stated above—the being sent by Christ, and the reception of the Holy Ghost. God has promised forgiveness wherever there is repentance; He has not promised repentance wherever there is sin. It results from every declaration of forgiveness made in the name of the Father through Jesus Christ, that hearts which in penitence accept it receive remission of their sins, and that the hardness of the hearts which wilfully reject it is by their rejection increased, and the very words by which their sins would be remitted become the words by which they are retained. (Comp. especially Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-17.htm" title="For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.">John 3:17</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a><span class= "ital"> et seq.;</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/2-15.htm" title="For we are to God a sweet smell of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:">2Corinthians 2:15-16</a>.)<p>On individual words in this verse it is important to note that in the better text the tense of that rendered “are remitted” is a strict present, while that rendered “are retained” is in the perfect-present. The difference is not easy to preserve in English, but the thought seems to be, “Whose soever sins ye remit—a change in their condition is taking place—their sins are being remitted by God; whose soever ye retain—their condition remains unchanged—they have been, and are retained.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:19-25 This was the first day of the week, and this day is afterwards often mentioned by the sacred writers; for it was evidently set apart as the Christian sabbath, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. The disciples had shut the doors for fear of the Jews; and when they had no such expectation, Jesus himself came and stood in the midst of them, having miraculously, though silently, opened the doors. It is a comfort to Christ's disciples, when their assemblies can only be held in private, that no doors can shut out Christ's presence. When He manifests his love to believers by the comforts of his Spirit, he assures them that because he lives, they shall live also. A sight of Christ will gladden the heart of a disciple at any time; and the more we see of Jesus, the more we shall rejoice. He said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost, thus showing that their spiritual life, as well as all their ability for their work, would be derived from him, and depended upon him. Every word of Christ which is received in the heart by faith, comes accompanied by this Divine breathing; and without this there is neither light nor life. Nothing is seen, known, discerned, or felt of God, but through this. After this, Christ directed the apostles to declare the only method by which sin would be forgiven. This power did not exist at all in the apostles as a power to give judgment, but only as a power to declare the character of those whom God would accept or reject in the day of judgment. They have clearly laid down the marks whereby a child of God may be discerned and be distinguished from a false professor; and according to what they have declared shall every case be decided in the day of judgment. When we assemble in Christ's name, especially on his holy day, he will meet with us, and speak peace to us. The disciples of Christ should endeavour to build up one another in their most holy faith, both by repeating what they have heard to those that were absent, and by making known what they have experienced. Thomas limited the Holy One of Israel, when he would be convinced by his own method or not at all. He might justly have been left in his unbelief, after rejecting such abundant proofs. The fears and sorrows of the disciples are often lengthened, to punish their negligence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whose soever sins ... - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-18.htm">Matthew 18:18</a>. It is worthy of remark here that Jesus confers the same power on all the apostles. He gives to no one of them any special authority. If Peter, as the Papists pretend, had been appointed to any special authority, it is wonderful that the Saviour did not here hint at any such pre-eminence. This passage conclusively proves that they were invested with equal power in organizing and governing the church. The authority which he had given Peter to preach the gospel first to the Jews and the Gentiles, does not militate against this. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18-19</a>. This authority given them was full proof that they were inspired. The meaning of the passage is not that man can forgive sins that belongs only to God <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a> but that they should be inspired; that in founding the church, and in declaring the will of God, they should be taught by the Holy Spirit to declare on what terms, to what characters, and to what temper of mind God would extend forgiveness of sins. It was not authority to forgive individuals, but to establish in all the churches the terms and conditions on which men might be pardoned, with a promise that God would confirm all that they taught; that all might have assurance of forgiveness who would comply with those terms; and that those who did not comply should not be forgiven, but that their sins should be retained. This commission is as far as possible from the authority which the Roman Catholic claims of remitting sin and of pronouncing pardon. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, &c.&#8212;In any literal and authoritative sense this power was never exercised by one of the apostles, and plainly was never understood by themselves as possessed by them or conveyed to them. (See on [1919]Mt 16:19). The power to intrude upon the relation between men and God cannot have been given by Christ to His ministers in any but a ministerial or declarative sense&#8212;as the authorized interpreters of His word, while in the actings of His ministers, the real nature of the power committed to them is seen in the exercise of church discipline.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whether <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-18.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.">Matthew 18:18</a></span> be a parallel text to this, I doubt: <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-18.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.">Matthew 18:18</a>"</span>. Our Lord here speaks of the sins of persons, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whose soever sins remit, </span>& c.; he saith there, <span class="ital">Whatsoever ye shall bind or loose.</span> This text hath caused a great deal of contest. All remission of sins is either authoritative; so it is most true, that none can forgive sin but God; and if we had no Scripture to prove it, yet reason will tell us none can discharge the debtor but the creditor, to whom the debt is owing: or else ministerial; thus he who is not the creditor (amongst men) may remit a debt by virtue of a letter of attorney made to him, authorizing him so to do. The question therefore amongst divines is, Whether Christ in this text hath given authority to his ministers actually to discharge men of the guilt of their sins; or only to declare unto them, that if their repentance and faith be true, their sins are really forgiven them? The former is by many contended for; but it doth not seem reasonable, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That God should entrust men with such a piece of his prerogative. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That God, who knoweth the falsehood of men’s hearts, and the inability in the best ministers to judge of the truth of any man’s faith or repentance, as also the passions to which they are subject, should give unto any of the sons of men an absolute power under him, and in his name, to discharge any from the guilt of sin; for certain it is, that without true repentance and faith in Christ no man hath his sins forgiven; so as no minister, that knoweth not the hearts of men, can possibly speak with any certainty to any man, saying, his sins are forgiven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What knowledge the apostles might have by the Spirit of discerning, we cannot say. But certain it is, none hath any such certainty of knowledge now of the truth of any man, declaring his faith and true repentance; from whence it is to me apparent, that no man hath any further power from Christ, than to declare to them, that if indeed they truly believe and repent, their sins are really forgiven. Only the minister, being Christ’s interpreter and ambassador, and better able to judge of true faith and repentance than others, (though not certainly and infallibly), such declarations from a faithful, able minister, are of more weight and authority than from others. And this is the most I can conceive should be in this matter; and that if by those words any further power be granted to the apostles, it was by reason of that power of <span class="ital">discerning of spirits, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:">1 Corinthians 12:10</a></span>, which ordinary ministers since the apostles’ times, or in latter ages, cannot with any modesty pretend unto. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Whose soever sins ye remit,.... God only can forgive sins, and Christ being God, has a power to do so likewise; but he never communicated any such power to his apostles; nor did they ever assume any such power to themselves, or pretend to exercise it; it is the mark of antichrist, to attempt anything of the kind; who, in so doing, usurps the divine prerogative, places himself in his seat, and shows himself as if he was God: but this is to be understood only in a doctrinal, or ministerial way, by preaching the full and free remission of sins, through the blood of Christ, according to the riches of God's grace, to such as repent of their sins, and believe in Christ; declaring, that all such persons as do so repent and believe, all their sins are forgiven for Christ's sake: and accordingly, <p>they are remitted unto them; in agreement with Christ's own words, in his declaration and commission to his disciples; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>. On the other hand he signifies, that <p>whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained: that is, that whatsoever sins ye declare are not forgiven, they are not forgiven; which is the case of all final unbelievers, and impenitent sinners; who dying without repentance towards God, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, according to the Gospel declaration, shall be damned, and are damned; for God stands by, and will stand by and confirm the Gospel of his Son, faithfully preached by his ministering servants; and all the world will sooner or later be convinced of the validity, truth, and certainty, of the declarations on each of these heads, made by them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; <i>and</i> whose soever <i>sins</i> ye retain, they are retained.</span><p>(6) The publishing of the forgiveness of sins by faith in Christ, and the setting forth and proclaiming the wrath of God in retaining the sins of the unbelievers, is the sum of the preaching of the gospel.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/20.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-23.htm" title="Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.">John 20:23</a>. The peculiar authority of the apostolical office, for the exercise of which they were fitted and empowered by this impartation of the Spirit. It was therefore an individual and specific charismatic endowment, the bestowal of which the Lord knew must be still connected with His personal presence, and was not to be deferred until after His ascension,[268] namely, that of the valid remission of sins, and of the opposite, that of the moral disciplinary authority, consisting not merely in the authorization to <span class="ital">receive into the Church</span> and to expel therefrom,[269] but also in the authorization of pardoning or of inflicting penal discipline on their <span class="ital">fellow-members</span>. The apostles exercised both authorizations, and it is without reason to understand only the former, since both essentially belonged to the <span class="ital">mission</span> (<span class="greekheb">πέμπω</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.">John 20:21</a>) of the apostles.

The apostolic power of the keys in the sense of the Church is contained directly in the present passage, in Matt. only indirectly. It had its <span class="ital">regulator</span> in the <span class="ital">Holy Spirit</span>, who separated its exercise from all human arbitrariness, so that the apostles were therein <span class="ital">organs of the Spirit</span>. That was the divine guarantee, as the consecration of moral certainty through the illumination and sanctification of the judgment in the performance of its acts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span>. instead of <span class="greekheb">ἐάν</span>, see Hermann, <span class="ital">ad Viger</span>. pp. 812, 822; frequently also in the Greek prose writers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀφίενται</span>] <span class="ital">They are remitted</span>, that is, by God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κρατῆτε</span>] He abides by the figure; opposite of loosing: <span class="ital">hold fast</span> (Polyb. viii. 20. 8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-24.htm" title="Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held of it.">Acts 2:24</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κεκράτ</span>] <span class="ital">They are held fast</span>, by God.

The authorisation of the Apostles is completed in the words: <span class="greekheb">ἄν τινων</span> … <span class="greekheb">κεκράτηνται</span>. “Whosesoever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven to them: whosesoever ye retain, they are retained.” The meaning of <span class="greekheb">κεκράτηνται</span> is determined by the opposed <span class="greekheb">ἀφέωνται</span> [the better reading]. The announcement is unexpected. Yet if they were to represent Him, they must be empowered to continue a function which He constantly exercised and set in the forefront of His ministry. They must be able in His name to pronounce forgiveness, and to threaten doom. This indeed formed the main substance of their ministry, and it was by receiving His Spirit they were fitted for it.

It must be noticed (1) that it is given to the whole company present; not to the Apostles alone. Of the Apostles one was absent, and there were others who were not Apostles present: no hint is given that this power is confined to the Ten. The commission therefore <span class="ital">in the first instance</span> is to the Christian community as a whole, not to the Ministry alone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It follows from this (2) that the power being conferred on the community and never revoked, the power continues so long as the community continues. While the Christian Church lasts it has the power of remitting and retaining along with the power of spiritual discernment which is part of the gift of the Spirit. That is, it has the power to declare the conditions on which forgiveness is granted and the fact that it has or has not been granted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It should be noted (3) that the expression throughout is plural on both sides. As it is the community rather than individuals that is invested with the power, so it is classes of men rather than individuals on whom it is exercised. <span class="ital">God</span> deals with mankind not in the mass but with personal love and knowledge soul by soul. His <span class="ital">Church</span> in fulfilling its mission from Him, while keeping this ideal in view, is compelled for the most part to minister to men in groups and classes. The plural here seems to indicate not what must always or ought to be the case, but what generally is.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">are remitted … are retained</span>] Both verbs are perfects, though there is some doubt about the reading as regards the former. The force of the perfect is—‘are <span class="ital">ipso facto</span> remitted’—‘are <span class="ital">ipso facto</span> retained.’ When the community under the guidance of the Spirit has spoken, the result is complete.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">retain</span>] i.e. ‘hold fast,’ so that they do not depart from the sinner.

Nor, however, is power of this kind not applicable to (nor does it not belong to) <span class="ital">all</span>, who <span class="ital">are endued with the Holy Spirit</span>, whether they discharge the public duty of the ministry of the word, or do not. Nay, but <span class="ital">the word of the Gospel</span> can be available for the remission of sins to those who yield themselves up to the influence of the Holy Spirit, even though it be not applied by the mediation of <span class="ital">ministers</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-16.htm" title="He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not shall be damned.">Mark 16:16</a>, “He that <span class="ital">believeth and is baptized</span>, shall be saved, but he that <span class="ital">believeth not</span>, shall be damned;” and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-47.htm" title="And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.">Luke 24:47</a>, “That <span class="ital">repentance and remission of sins</span> should be <span class="ital">preached</span> in His name,” are parallel to this passage.[399]—V. g.]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[399] Which therefore is not to be interpreted of sacerdotal absolution and penance.—E. and T.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/20.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Remit (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Only here in this Gospel in connection with sins.
