(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-38.htm" title="But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works: that you may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.">John 10:38</a>, and references in Note there.) But the words seem to carry us forwards as well as backwards. In the next chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-23.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.">John 11:23</a>) our Lord says. “The hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified,” and the reference is to His death. Is that thought absent from the words here? The sickness of Lazarus would not indeed issue in death, though it would end in what men call death, and would be the immediate cause leading to the death of the Son of Man. The one would be as a sleep from which he would awake, the other should be the glorifying the Son of God, which would issue in the life of the world.<p>“Thereby” is probably to be interpreted “by means of the illness,” not “by means of the glory.”<p>This verse should be compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a>. Here, as there, part of the meaning is that the glory of God would be effected in the person of him upon whom the miracle would be wrought. It was a spiritual crisis in the case of the man born blind. It cannot have been otherwise in the case of Lazarus.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-6 It is no new thing for those whom Christ loves, to be sick; bodily distempers correct the corruption, and try the graces of God's people. He came not to preserve his people from these afflictions, but to save them from their sins, and from the wrath to come; however, it behoves us to apply to Him in behalf of our friends and relatives when sick and afflicted. Let this reconcile us to the darkest dealings of Providence, that they are all for the glory of God: sickness, loss, disappointment, are so; and if God be glorified, we ought to be satisfied. Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. The families are greatly favoured in which love and peace abound; but those are most happy whom Jesus loves, and by whom he is beloved. Alas, that this should seldom be the case with every person, even in small families. God has gracious intentions, even when he seems to delay. When the work of deliverance, temporal or spiritual, public or personal, is delayed, it does but stay for the right time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This sickness is not unto death - The word "death" here is equivalent to remaining under death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. "The wages of sin is death" - permanent or unchanging death, opposed to eternal life. Jesus evidently did not intend to deny that he would die. The words which he immediately adds show that he would expire, and that he would raise him up to show forth the power and glory of God. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a>. Those words cannot be understood on any other supposition than that he expected to raise him up. The Saviour often used expressions similar to this to fix the attention on what he was about to say in explanation. The sense may be thus expressed: "His sickness is not fatal. It is not designed for his death, but to furnish an opportunity for a signal display of the glory of God, and to furnish a standing proof of the truth of religion. It is intended to exhibit the power of the Son of God, and to be a proof at once of the truth of his mission; of his friendship for this family; of his mild, tender, special love as a man; of his power and glory as the Messiah; and of the great doctrine that the dead will rise.<p>For the glory of God - That God may be honored. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm">John 9:3</a>.<p>That the Son of God ... - The glory of God and of his Son is the same. That which promotes the one promotes also the other. Few things could do it more than the miracle which follows, evincing at once the lovely and tender character of Jesus as a man and a friend, and his power as the equal with God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death&#8212;to result in death.<p>but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby&#8212;that is, by this glory of God. (See Greek.) Remarkable language this, which from creature lips would have been intolerable. It means that the glory of God manifested in the resurrection of dead Lazarus would be shown to be the glory, personally and immediately, of THE Son.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God hath not sent this sickness upon Lazarus to determine his being upon the earth; or such a separation of the soul of Lazarus from his body, as there shall be no reunion of it before the general resurrection (which is our ordinary notion of death); God hath not sent this sickness for that purpose, but that he might be glorified by his Son raising him from the dead. God is glorified when his Son is glorified; and Christ is glorified when his Divine power is manifested, so as men acknowledge him to be what indeed he is. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When Jesus heard that,.... That his friend Lazarus was sick, <p>he said; either to his disciples, or to the messenger or messengers that brought the account to him, and that on purpose to yield some relief to the afflicted family when it should be reported to them: <p>this sickness is not unto death; it was to issue in death, but not in death which was to continue, or under which Lazarus was to continue till the general resurrection; for though he should die, yet he should be so quickly restored again to life, that it scarcely deserved the name of death. The Jews distinguish between sickness and sickness; there are some that are sick, the greater part of whom are,  "for life"; and there are others that are "sick", the greater part of whom are,  "for death" (z), or are sick unto death, whose sickness issues in death; but this of Lazarus's was not to be unto death, at least not finally: <p>but for the glory of God; of his power and goodness in raising him again: <p>that the Son of God might be glorified thereby; that is, that his glory, as the Son of God, might be made manifest in the resurrection of him from the dead; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>. <p>(z) T.
