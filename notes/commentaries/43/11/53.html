Words of prophecy in the mouth, are not clear evidence of a principle of grace in the heart. The calamity we seek to escape by sin, we take the most effectual course to bring upon our own heads; as those do who think by opposing Christ's kingdom, to advance their own worldly interest. The fear of the wicked shall come upon them. The conversion of souls is the gathering of them to Christ as their ruler and refuge; and he died to effect this.

This utterance of Caiaphas brought sudden light to the members of the Sanhedrim, and so influenced their perplexed mind that <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ ἐκείνης ἡμέρας συνεβουλεύσαντο ἵνα ἀποκτείνωσιν αὐτόν</span>.

The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> shows that the advice of Caiaphas was followed, and whereas before this, minor courts and synagogues had plotted the ruin of Jesus, and they themselves had excommunicated his followers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9.htm">John 9</a>.), yet, after this evil counsel, they deliberated on the surest and safest way of <span class="accented">destroying</span> him. The sentence had gone forth. They bound themselves to secure his arrest for this purpose. Some of their number, a small minority, including Joseph of Arimathaea, disapproved of this counsel, and withdrew from their society (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-51.htm">Luke 23:51</a>), but the majority overruled the dissidents. This is the very climax of their perversity. They have resolved on the death-penalty. The sentence has been recorded against the Holiest. Priesthood and prophecy have pronounced their final verdict. They have extinguished themselves. Nevertheless, that which proved the occasion of their malice became a further proof of his Divine goodness and superhuman claims. </body></html>
