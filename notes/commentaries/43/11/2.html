He came not to preserve his people from these afflictions, but to save them from their sins, and from the wrath to come; however, it behoves us to apply to Him in behalf of our friends and relatives when sick and afflicted. Let this reconcile us to the darkest dealings of Providence, that they are all for the glory of God: sickness, loss, disappointment, are so; and if God be glorified, we ought to be satisfied. Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. The families are greatly favoured in which love and peace abound; but those are most happy whom Jesus loves, and by whom he is beloved. Alas, that this should seldom be the case with every person, even in small families. God has gracious intentions, even when he seems to delay. When the work of deliverance, temporal or spiritual, public or personal, is delayed, it does but stay for the right time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was that Mary ... - See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a> note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/7-36.htm">Luke 7:36-50</a> notes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, &c.&#8212;This, though not recorded by our Evangelist till Joh 12:3, was so well known in the teaching of all the churches, according to our Lord's prediction (Mt 26:13), that it is here alluded to by anticipation, as the most natural way of identifying her; and she is first named, though the younger, as the more distinguished of the two. She "anointed THE Lord," says the Evangelist&#8212;led doubtless to the use of this term here, as he was about to exhibit Him illustriously as the Lord of Life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> We read of a woman, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37</a>,38</span>, that came behind our Saviour while he was at dinner, in the house of Simon the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box of ointment, stood at his feet behind him weeping, washing his feet with her tears, and wiping them with her hair; but it appears by the story, she had been before a notorious sinner. We read of another woman, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-6.htm" title="Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,">Matthew 26:6</a>,7 Mr 14:3</span>, that poured a box of ointment on our Saviour’s head as he was at dinner in the house of Simon the leper: but we, in those two evangelists, read nothing of her washing his feet with her tears, or wiping them with her hair; but in the next chapter of this Gospel, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a></span>, we have a story which (whether it be the same with the other or no, I cannot tell) is that doubtless to which this verse refers: the names and circumstances much agree.

In order further to identify Lazarus it is added: “Now it was (that) Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill”. This act of Mary’s has not yet been narrated by John (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a>), but it was this which distinguished her at the time John was writing; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-13.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman has done, be told for a memorial of her.">Matthew 26:13</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">It was that Mary which anointed</span>] This of course does not necessarily imply that the anointing had already taken place, as those who identify Mary with the ‘sinner’ of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37</a> would insist: it merely implies that when S. John wrote, this fact was well known about her, as Christ had promised should be the case (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-13.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman has done, be told for a memorial of her.">Matthew 26:13</a>). S. John tells two facts omitted in the earlier Gospels; (1) that the village of Martha and Mary was Bethany, (2) that the anointing at Bethany was Mary’s act. The identification of Mary of Bethany with the prostitute of Luke 7 is altogether at variance with what S. Luke and S. John tell us of her character. Nor is there any sufficient reason for identifying either of them with Mary Magdalene. Mary of Bethany, Mary of Magdala, and the ‘sinner’ of Luke 7 are three distinct persons.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-2.htm" title="(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)">John 11:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἦν δὲ Μαρία</span>, <span class="ital">moreover it was the Mary</span>) John proves Mary’s pious affection towards Jesus at the present time (as he elsewhere in a similar way proves the absence of pious affection on the part of the traitor) by a subsequent act, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-3.htm" title="Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.">John 12:3</a> [Mary’s anointing Jesus’ feet with costly ointment of spikenard, and wiping His feet with her hair].

In classical Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was used of costly ointments used by women. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was the common oil used by men for purposes of health, which might be perfumed. Our Lord clearly draws a distinction between the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-46.htm">Luke 7:46</a>. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> has been said to be used for the more superfluous anointings and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;</span> for the sanitary anointing with oil. No trace of such distinction is found in the New Testament (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a>). One great distinction in biblical Greek is that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is used of religious anointings, from its association with <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in the LXX. is only twice used in this sense, while <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is used times without number (Archbishop Trench, 'New Test. Syn.,' &sect; 38.). The use of the term <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Lord," shows that the story was widely known, and that when the Gospel was written it had passed into a commonplace of Christian experience and illustration. The anointing has not yet been referred to by John, but he is looking back upon the events and anticipates his own subsequent record. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Anointed (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;)<p>Three words for anointing are found in the New Testament: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;, &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;, and its compounds, and &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;. The last is used but once, <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>, of anointing the Lord's body for burying. Between the two others the distinction is strictly maintained. &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;, which occurs five times, is used in every case but one of the anointing of the Son by the Father With the Holy Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>). In the remaining instance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-21.htm">2 Corinthians 1:21</a>) of enduing Christians with the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Thus the word is confined to sacred anointing. &#x391;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c9; is used of all actual anointings. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm">Matthew 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-13.htm">Mark 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-38.htm">Luke 7:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14</a>. The same distinction is generally maintained in the Septuagint, though with a few exceptions, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-3.htm">Numbers 3:3</a>. </body></html>
