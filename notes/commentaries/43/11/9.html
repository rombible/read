His answer would say that the darkness of the night which they dreaded could not come yet. The natural night would come not until its appointed hour, until the twelve hours of the day had run their course. The day of His life is marked out by limits no less sure. The night indeed cometh, but it is as yet full day, and in that day He and they must do the work which is appointed of the Father.

We are apt to think ourselves zealous for the Lord, when really we are only zealous for our wealth, credit, ease, and safety; we have therefore need to try our principles. But our day shall be lengthened out, till our work is done, and our testimony finished. A man has comfort and satisfaction while in the way of his duty, as set forth by the word of God, and determined by the providence of God. Christ, wherever he went, walked in the day; and so shall we, if we follow his steps. If a man walks in the way of his heart, and according to the course of this world, if he consults his own carnal reasonings more than the will and glory of God, he falls into temptations and snares. He stumbles, because there is no light in him; for light in us is to our moral actions, that which light about us to our natural actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Twelve hours - The Jews divided the day from sunrise to sunset into twelve equal parts. A similar illustration our Saviour uses in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4-5</a>. See the notes at that place.<p>If any man walk - If any man travels. The illustration here is taken from a traveler. The conversation was respecting a journey into Judea, and our Lord, as was his custom, took the illustration from the case before him.<p>He stumbleth not - He is able, having light, to make his journey safely. He sees the obstacles or dangers and can avoid them.<p>The light of this world - The light by which the world is illuminated that is, the light of the sun.<p>In the night - In darkness he is unable to see danger or obstacles, and to avoid them. His journey is unsafe and perilous, or, in other words, it is not a proper time to travel.<p>No light in him - He sees no light. It is dark; his eyes admit no light within him to direct his way. This description is figurative, and it is difficult to fix the meaning. Probably the intention was the following:<p>1. Jesus meant to say that there was an allotted or appointed time for him to live and do his Father's will, represented here by the 12 hours of the day.<p>2. Though his life was nearly spent, yet it was not entirely; a remnant of it was left.<p>3. A traveler journeyed on until night. It was as proper for him to travel the twelfth hour as any other.<p>4. So it was proper for Jesus to labor until the close. It was the proper time for him to work. The night of death was coming, and no work could then be done.<p>5. God would defend him in this until the appointed time of his death. He had nothing to fear, therefore, in Judea from the Jews, until it was the will of God that he should die. He was safe in his hand, and he went fearlessly into the midst of his foes, trusting in him. This passage teaches us that we should be diligent to the end of life: fearless of enemies when we know that God requires us to labor, and confidently committing ourselves to Him who is able to shield us, and in whose hand, if we have a conscience void of offence, we are safe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?&#8212;(See on [1829]Joh 9:4). Our Lord's day had now reached its eleventh hour, and having till now "walked in the day," He would not mistime the remaining and more critical part of His work, which would be as fatal, He says, as omitting it altogether; for "if a man (so He speaks, putting Himself under the same great law of duty as all other men&#8212;if a man) walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Look as in the day there are twelve hours, in which the sun shineth, and by giving its light directs men in their courses; so as they know how to guide their feet, and do not stumble, because they have the light of the sun, which God hath ordained, to direct men that walk up and down in the world. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus answered, are there not twelve hours in the day?.... So the Jews reckoned, and so they commonly say (a),    , "twelve hours are a day", or a day consists of twelve hours, which they divided into four parts, each part consisting of three hours this was a matter well known, and Christ puts the question as such, it being what might be easily answered, and at once assented to: <p>if any man walk in the day: within any of the twelve hours, even in the last of them, <p>he stumbleth not, at any stone or stumbling block in the way, <p>because he seeth the light of this world; the sun in the horizon not being as yet set, by the light of which he sees what is before him, and avoids it; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>. So our Lord intimates, that as yet it was day with him, his time of life was not expired; and so, as yet, it was a time of walking and working; nor did he fear any danger he was exposed to, or any snares that were laid for him, since he could not be hurt by any, nor his life taken from him before his time. <p>(a) T.

If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world....">John 11:9-10</a>. The sense of the allegorical answer is this: “<span class="ital">The time appointed to me by God for working is not yet elapsed; as long as it lasts, no one can do anything to me; but when it shall have come to an end, I shall fall into the hands of my enemies</span>, like him who walketh in the night, and who stumbleth, because he is without light.” In this way Jesus sets aside the anxiety of His disciples, on the one hand, by directing their attention to the fact that, as His time is not yet expired, He is <span class="ital">safe</span> from the apprehended dangers; and, on the other, by reminding them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-10.htm" title="But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.">John 11:10</a>) that He must make <span class="ital">use</span> of the time apportioned to Him, before it come to an end.[72] So substantially Apollinaris (<span class="greekheb">διδάσκει ὁ κύριος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι πρὸ τοῦ καιροῦ τοῦ πάθους οὐκ ἂν ὑπὸ Ἰουδαίων πάθοι</span>· <span class="greekheb">καὶ διδάσκει τοῦτο διὰ παραβολῆς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡμέρας μὲν καιρὸν ὀνομάζων τὸν πρὸ τοῦ πάθους</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸν δὲ τοῦ πάθους νύκτα</span>), Ruperti (only partially), Jansen, Maldonatus, Corn.a Lapide, Wolf, Heumann, and several others; also Maier and B. Crusius; comp. Ewald and Hengstenberg. On individual points, note further: (1) <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΏΔΕΚΑ</span></span></span> is placed emphatically at the beginning, signifying that the day referred to is <span class="ital">still running on</span>, and that anxiety is still premature (not: <span class="ital">only</span> twelve hours; Bengel correctly remarks: “jam multa erat hora, sed tamen adhuc erat dies”). The supposition that Jesus spoke the words early in the morning, at sunrise (Godet, Gumlich), is as arbitrary as it is unnecessary. (2) <span class="greekheb">τὸ φῶς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κόσμ</span>. is the <span class="ital">light of the sun</span>, so designated in harmony with the elevated tone which marks the entire saying; the words <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> … <span class="greekheb">βλέπει</span> belong merely to the <span class="ital">details</span> of the picture, and are not intended to be specially <span class="ital">interpreted</span> (for example, of the guidance of the divine will, as Godet thinks, following older commentators). (3) Applying the figure to Jesus, <span class="ital">night</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-10.htm" title="But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.">John 11:10</a>) commenced with the <span class="greekheb">ἐλήλυθεν ἡ ὥρα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you:">John 17:1</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.">John 12:27</a>); the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΜΈΡΑ</span></span></span> with its twelve hours was then over for Him, and, according to the divine decree, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΚΟΠΉ</span></span></span> in His path which, with the close of the twelfth hour, had become dark, must now follow,[73] in that He fell into the hands of His enemies; till then, however, <span class="greekheb">οὔπω ἐληλύθει ἡ ὥρα αὐτοῦ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-30.htm" title="Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.">John 7:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-20.htm" title="These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.">John 8:20</a>. (4) The expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ΤῸ Φῶς ΟὐΚ ἜΣΤΙΝ ἘΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span></span></span>, which is also a detail not intended for interpretation, is not equivalent to: <span class="ital">he has not</span>, etc. (Ewald; it is also inadmissible to take this view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-10.htm" title="The days of our years are three score years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.">Psalm 90:10</a>), but is an outflow of the notion that, in the case of a man walking in the night, it is dark <span class="ital">in him</span>, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. <span class="ital">his representation</span> of his surroundings is dark and without light, so that he cannot discover his whereabouts <span class="ital">in his consciousness</span> of that which is round about him. Grotius: “in <span class="ital">oculis</span> ejus;” but the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> suggests the inner intuition and representation. (5) Substantially the same, and decisive for the view which the disciples would take, are the thought and figure in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a> f.; hence also here neither is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἩΜΈΡΑ</span></span></span> to be taken as an image of <span class="ital">tempus opportunum</span> (Morus, Rosenmüller, Paulus, Kuinoel), nor <span class="greekheb">νύξ</span> of <span class="ital">tempus importunum</span>; nor is it any more allowable to say, with Gumlich and Brückner (comp. Melanchthon, Beza, and Calvin), that <span class="greekheb">φῶς τοῦ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. is <span class="ital">God</span>, who shows the Son the way, so that this latter thus walks <span class="ital">in the day</span>, and His person and work remain unendangered (<span class="greekheb">οὐ προσκόπτει</span>[74]); similarly Baeumlein; Lücke, on the other hand, rightly refers <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ἩΜΈΡΑς</span></span></span> to the “<span class="ital">day’s work</span>” of Christ, which has its <span class="ital">definite limit</span> (its twelve hours); but then he explains <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ</span> of fulfilling the <span class="ital">duties of His calling</span> (comp. Melanchthon), which is always the way of safety, and takes <span class="greekheb">νύξ</span> as an image of <span class="ital">unfaithfulness to one’s calling</span>, which leads to destruction. In this way, however, <span class="ital">two</span> totally <span class="ital">different</span> meanings are assigned to the figurative term <span class="greekheb">ἡμέρα</span>, the second of which is the more decidedly to be rejected, as the mention of twelve hours is evidence that the <span class="ital">temporal</span> explanation alone is correct. For this reason, further, we must reject not only the view taken by De Wette, who regards the day as the image of “<span class="ital">upright, innocent, clear action</span>,” the twelve hours, as the <span class="ital">ways and means</span> of action, and the night as the <span class="ital">lack of prudence and singlemindedness;</span> but also that of Luthardt: “He who keeps within the limits of his calling will not strike against anything, will not make false steps, for the light of the world, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. the will of God, gives him light; he, however, who passes beyond the limits of his calling will go wrong in his doings, seeing that he is guided, not by God’s will, but by his own pleasure.” Tholuck also diverges from the consistent carrying out of the temporal view; for, though understanding the twelve hours of the day of the fixed <span class="ital">time</span> of the vocation, he afterwards introduces the calling itself: “Whoso abides not by his calling will come to damage.” Comp. Schweizer, p. 106; also Lange, who combines several very different views. According to Chrysostom, Theophylact, and Euth. Zigabenus, the walking in the day denotes either a <span class="ital">blameless walk</span>, in which a man has no need to be afraid; <span class="ital">or fellowship with Christ</span> (so also Erasmus: “quamdiu vobis luceo, nihil est periculi; veniet nox, quando a me semoti conturbabimini.”[75] Vatablus, Clarius, Lampe, Neander). Both are incorrect, for the simple reason that the disciples had expressed concern, not for <span class="ital">themselves</span>, but for <span class="ital">Christ</span>, by their question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-8.htm" title="His disciples say to him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone you; and go you thither again?">John 11:8</a> (Chrysostom and his followers arbitrarily remark that they had been more in anxiety, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ ἑαυτῶν</span>); and because the former of these views would furnish no explanation of the <span class="ital">mention of the hours</span>, which is just the key to the figure. This objection holds good also against Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr</span>. p. 263, who brings out as the meaning of Jesus: He has the light absolutely in Himself, and for Him, therefore, no dark point can exist in His earthly course. On this view, moreover, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-10.htm" title="But if a man walk in the night, he stumbles, because there is no light in him.">John 11:10</a> remains without explanation. Olshausen, adopting the second view of Chrysostom, is prepared to accept an unhermeneutical double meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἡμέρα</span>;—in the one case, mindful of His near brotherly relationship to men, Jesus regarded Himself as accomplishing His ordained <span class="ital">day’s work;</span> but, in the other case, He had in view His higher dignity as the <span class="ital">spiritual enlightener</span>, in the rays of whose brightness the disciples would have nothing to fear.[76] Comp. Bengel, who thinks that <span class="greekheb">τὸ φῶς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κόσμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τούτου</span> signifies the “providentia <span class="ital">Patris</span> respectu <span class="ital">Jesu</span>, et providentia <span class="ital">Christi</span> respectu <span class="ital">fidelium</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[72] Not, as Godet interprets: that He <span class="ital">dare not lengthen</span> the working time appointed to Him by the divine will, that He may not venture to <span class="ital">add to it as it were a thirteenth hour</span>. Such a thought was totally foreign to the minds of the disciples in giving their warning. All that they desired was, that He should not <span class="ital">shorten</span> His life by exposing Himself to the threatening danger of death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[73] The idea set forth is therefore not “the wish to be active <span class="ital">beyond the ordained goal and limit of life</span>,” which would, indeed, be absurd (Tholuck’s objection); but to be set free of activity <span class="ital">on the attainment of the ordained goal of life</span>. When the twelfth hour has passed, <span class="ital">night</span> falls on the wanderer, and he stumbles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[74] Ver. 10. <span class="greekheb">τὸ φῶς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ</span> is then explained by Brückner, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-22.htm" title="The light of the body is the eye: if therefore your eye be single, your whole body shall be full of light.">Matthew 6:22</a> f., to mean that the eye, which has received the light, becomes itself a lamp, and so the whole man is illumined. But how could Jesus expect the disciples to understand so far-fetched an illusion? If such had been His meaning, He must have used, in agreement with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-23.htm" title="But if your eye be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you be darkness, how great is that darkness!">Matthew 6:23</a>, some such words as: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι τὸ φῶς τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ σχότος ἐστιν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[75] So in the <span class="ital">Paraphr.</span> But in the <span class="ital">Annotat.</span> he takes substantially our view: “Dies habet suas horas, nec is nostro arbitrio fit brevior aut longior; et ego tempus habeo praescriptum, quo debeam redimendi orbis negotium peragere, id Judaeorum malitia non potest anticipari: proinde nihil est, quod mihi timeatis.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[76] Ebrard adopts Olshausen’s view in the following more definite shape: “The day has its determinate measured duration. If a man use the day as <span class="ital">day, i.e.</span> the time for working given him by God <span class="ital">as a time of working</span>, he needs to be in no fear that his working will bring him mischief, for the light of the mundane sun illumines him. But he who walks <span class="ital">as though it were night, i.e. without working the will of God</span>, would procure for himself eternal mischief, because he had not in him the light (in the absolute sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-5.htm" title="And the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.">John 1:5</a>).” In this way the essential elements are read into the passage; and what a strange difference in the conceptions found in the same expressions! How could the disciples have possibly understood their Master!<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

The night cometh, when I can no longer work; but it has not yet come.’ Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>. Thus it is practically equivalent to ‘Mine hour is not yet come;’ it is still safe for Him to work: but the figure here adopted is of wider application, and contains a moral for the disciples and all Christians as well as an application to Christ. The expression throws no light on S. John’s method of reckoning time. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-14.htm" title="And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he said to the Jews, Behold your King!">John 19:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the light of this world</span>] The sun.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-9.htm" title="Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day?

Comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm" title="I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.">John 9:4</a>, “<span class="ital">I</span> must work, etc.: the night cometh, when <span class="ital">no man</span> can work.” This applies to the disciples, who were afraid, even for themselves.—<span class="greekheb">οὐ προσκόπτει</span>, <span class="ital">he does not stumble</span>) in the midst of snares of the world lying in his way.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ φῶς τοῦ κόσμου τούτου</span>, <span class="ital">the light of this world</span>) beaming out from the sun.

But in both instances the clause, which is expressed, is especially suited to its own passage respectively: for during the day, <span class="ital">the light of the world, which each one sees</span>, as it were absorbs the sense of the light which he has in himself. By night the light of the world, being not seen, increases the sense of his defect in the case of him <span class="ital">who hath no light in himself.</span><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</span> The answer of Jesus is a further deliverance concerning the human law and season (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) of work - a parable drawn from earthly and human analogies, which will unquestionably have a direct bearing on the conditions of Divine service at all time, and is therefore applicable to the disciples with himself. It receives also special significance from some aspects of Christ's own ministry, and from the step he had just now declared that he intended to take. Of course, the parable is based upon the conditions of human work; one of these conditions is <span class="accented">light</span>, another of them is <span class="accented">time</span>. Light is necessary for all the wise efforts of men - the light of day, the light of this world or the sun; we must see whither we are going, in order to avoid the occasions of stumbling. We must submit to this comprehensive condition, or we fail (cf. here <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>, "I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day; the night cometh, when no man can work"). There are two kinds of night of which he speaks. One is the night which arrests all labor, the night of death; and the other is the night of ignorance and unbelief, when the light that is in a man becomes darkness, when, if a man does attempt to work or walk, he will stumble. Meyer and some others, from the reference to another condition, viz. that of <span class="accented">time</span>, persist in limiting the notion of the <span class="accented">day</span> to that of the period of service, about which the Lord says also some very solemn things; and Meyer objects to Luthardt and others, who give to the sun, to the light of this world, any moral or spiritual meaning. We need not limit the application. Light may mean knowledge of duty supplied by God's providence and the revelation of his will, and so far as "day" is made by light, it is important to notice it here. But <span class="accented">time</span> is an equally important condition, and whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4, 5</a> the Lord laid emphasis upon the <span class="accented">limited</span> amount of opportunity during which the light lasts and the work can be done; so here there is an <span class="accented">appointed</span> period during which stumbling is unnecessary: "twelve hours in the day." This (I take to be Christ's meaning) is one of these hours, and before the night comes "I must work." Godet suggests that the disciples, by this question, recommended him not to shorten his career by courting danger, and so to create for himself "a thirteenth hour" to the day, in which he would secure no blessing; that the Lord condemned the proposal, knowing that he was immortal till his hour had come; and that if we shrink from a call of duty, and thus save ourselves, adding an unhallowed increment to our day of useless work, we incur the like condemnation, we shall stumble. Let it be observed that the reason for working in the night is not because we have twelve hours for duty and no more, but because, though we have a time of service and an opportunity, we have let both slip past us, and then the work is difficult and perilous if we do attempt it. Some have said that Judas, Peter, Thomas, <span class="accented">etc</span>., walked in the night, and that they stumbled and fell. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Walk (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;)<p>Walk about, in the pursuit of his ordinary business.
