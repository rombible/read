The present word means not the cry of lamentation nor the wail of excessive grief, but the calm shedding of tears. They are on the way to the sepulchre, near to which they have now arrived. He is conscious of the power which He is about to exercise, and that the first result will be the glory of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a>); but He is conscious also of the suffering hearts near Him, and the sympathy with human sorrow is no less part of His nature than the union with divine strength. Men have wondered to find in the Gospel which opens with the express declaration of the divinity of our Lord, and at a moment when that divinity was about to receive its fullest manifestation, these words, which point them still to human weakness. But the central thought of St. John’s Gospel is “The Word was made flesh,” and He is for us the Resurrection and the Life, because He has been manifested to us, not as an abstraction which the intellect only could receive, but as a person, living a human life, and knowing its sorrows, whom the heart can grasp and love. A “God in tears” has provoked the smile of the stoic and the scorn of the unbeliever; but Christianity is not a gospel of self-sufficiency, and its message is not merely to the human intellect. It is salvation for the whole man and for every man; and the sorrowing heart of humanity has never seen more clearly the divinity of the Son of Man than when it has seen His glory shining through His human tears.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:33-46 Christ's tender sympathy with these afflicted friends, appeared by the troubles of his spirit. In all the afflictions of believers he is afflicted. His concern for them was shown by his kind inquiry after the remains of his deceased friend. Being found in fashion as a man, he acts in the way and manner of the sons of men. It was shown by his tears. He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. Tears of compassion resemble those of Christ. But Christ never approved that sensibility of which many are proud, while they weep at mere tales of distress, but are hardened to real woe. He sets us an example to withdraw from scenes of giddy mirth, that we may comfort the afflicted. And we have not a High Priest who cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities. It is a good step toward raising a soul to spiritual life, when the stone is taken away, when prejudices are removed, and got over, and way is made for the word to enter the heart. If we take Christ's word, and rely on his power and faithfulness, we shall see the glory of God, and be happy in the sight. Our Lord Jesus has taught us, by his own example, to call God Father, in prayer, and to draw nigh to him as children to a father, with humble reverence, yet with holy boldness. He openly made this address to God, with uplifted eyes and loud voice, that they might be convinced the Father had sent him as his beloved Son into the world. He could have raised Lazarus by the silent exertion of his power and will, and the unseen working of the Spirit of life; but he did it by a loud call. This was a figure of the gospel call, by which dead souls are brought out of the grave of sin: and of the sound of the archangel's trumpet at the last day, with which all that sleep in the dust shall be awakened, and summoned before the great tribunal. The grave of sin and this world, is no place for those whom Christ has quickened; they must come forth. Lazarus was thoroughly revived, and returned not only to life, but to health. The sinner cannot quicken his own soul, but he is to use the means of grace; the believer cannot sanctify himself, but he is to lay aside every weight and hinderance. We cannot convert our relatives and friends, but we should instruct, warn, and invite them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jesus wept - It has been remarked that this is the shortest verse in the Bible; but it is exceedingly important and tender. It shows the Lord Jesus as a friend, a tender friend, and evinces his character as a man. And from this we learn:<p>1. That the most tender personal friendship is not inconsistent with the most pure religion. Piety binds stronger the ties of friendship, makes more tender the emotions of love, and seals and sanctifies the affections of friends.<p>2. It is right, it is natural, it is indispensable for the Christian to sympathize with others in their afflictions. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>; "rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."<p>3. Sorrow at the death of friends is not improper. It is right to weep. It is the expression of nature and religion does not forbid or condemn it. All that religion does in the case is to temper and chasten our grief; to teach us to mourn with submission to God; to weep without complaining, and to seek to banish tears, not by hardening the heart or forgetting the friend, but by bringing the soul, made tender by grief, to receive the sweet influences of religion, and to find calmness and peace in the God of all consolation.<p>4. We have here an instance of the tenderness of the character of Jesus, The same Savior wept over Jerusalem, and felt deeply for poor dying, sinners. To the same tender and compassionate Saviour Christians may now come <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>; and to him the penitent sinner may also come, knowing that he will not cast him away. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. Jesus wept&#8212;This beautifully conveys the sublime brevity of the two original words; else "shed tears" might have better conveyed the difference between the word here used and that twice employed in Joh 11:33, and there properly rendered "weeping," denoting the loud wail for the dead, while that of Jesus consisted of silent tears. Is it for nothing that the Evangelist, some sixty years after it occurred, holds up to all ages with such touching brevity the sublime spectacle of the Son of God in tears? What a seal of His perfect oneness with us in the most redeeming feature of our stricken humanity! But was there nothing in those tears beyond sorrow for human suffering and death? Could these effects move Him without suggesting the cause? Who can doubt that in His ear every feature of the scene proclaimed that stern law of the Kingdom, "The wages of sin is death" (Ro 6:23), and that this element in His visible emotion underlay all the rest?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-34.htm" title="And said, Where have you laid him?

As he was going along to the grave, see  <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-28.htm">John 11:28</a>; as he was meditating upon the state of his friend Lazarus, the distress his two sisters were in, and the greater damnation that would befall the Jews then present, who, notwithstanding the miracle, would not believe in him. This shows him to be truly and really man, subject to like passions, only without sin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Jesus wept.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-35.htm" title="Jesus wept.">John 11:35</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐδάκρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ Ἰ</span>.] He weeps, whilst on His way to the sepulchre, with those who were weeping.

It is also worthy of notice, that <span class="greekheb">δακρύειν</span> is here used, and not again <span class="greekheb">κλαίειν</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>His lamenting is a <span class="ital">shedding of tears</span> in quiet anguish, not a weeping with loud lamentation, not a <span class="greekheb">κλαυθμός</span> as over Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-41.htm" title="And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,">Luke 19:41</a>. It is a delicate discrimination of expressions, unforced, and true. According to Baur, indeed, tears for a dead man, whose grave was being approached in the certainty of his being raised to life again, could not be the expression of a true, genuinely human fellow-feeling. As though such feelings could be determined in a manner involving such deliberation, and as if the death of His friend, the grief of those by whom He was accompanied, as well as the wailings of the sisters, were not sufficient, <span class="ital">of themselves alone</span>, to arouse His loving sympathy to tears! It is precisely a genuine human emotion, which neither could nor should resist the painful impression produced by such a moment. But those obliterate the delicate character of this trait with their hard dogmatic hand, who make the tears shed by Christ refer to “the <span class="ital">misery of the human race</span> pictured forth in Lazarus” (Hengstenberg, comp. Gumlich).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">35</span>. <span class="ital">Jesus wept</span>] Or, <span class="bld">shed tears</span>.

He sheds tears on His way to their brother’s grave, not because He is ignorant or doubtful of what is coming, but because He cannot but sympathize with the intensity of His friends’ grief. “The intense humanity attributed to Jesus, His affection, His visible suffering, the effort with which He collects Himself, are all strong marks of authenticity, and the more so because they might be thought to conflict with the doctrine of the prologue. But this is but one more proof how little that doctrine has disturbed the Evangelist’s true historic recollection.” S. pp. 186, 7.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-35.htm" title="Jesus wept.">John 11:35</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐδάκρυσεν</span>, [<span class="ital">wept</span>] <span class="ital">shed tears</span>) not <span class="ital">cried aloud</span> [<span class="ital">lacrymatus est</span>, non <span class="ital">ploravit</span>]; nor did He weep at once; nor yet did He weep only after [not until after] He had seen Lazarus, but at the exact time when it was seasonable.

The shortest verse, but one of the most suggestive in the entire Scripture. The great wrath against death is subdued now into <span class="accented">tears</span> of love, of sympathy, and of deep emotion. Jesus shed tears of sympathetic sorrow. This is in sacred and eternal refutation of the theory which deprives the incarnate Logos of St. John of human heart and spirit. These tears have been for all the ages a grand testimony to the fullness of his humanity, and also a Diving revelation of the very heart of God (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>). It was not a <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as the weeping over Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>), but profound and wondrous fellow-feeling with human misery in all its forms, then imaged before him in the grave of Lazarus. It is akin to the judicial blindness which has obscured for the T&uuml;bingen school so much of the glory of Divine revelation, that Baur should regard this weeping of Jesus as unhistorical. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Wept (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>A different verb from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-31.htm">John 11:31</a>.

Only here in the New Testament. &#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;, to weep audibly, is once used of our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>. "The very Gospel in which the deity of Jesus is most clearly asserted, is also that which makes us best acquainted with the profoundly human side of His life" (Godet). How far such a conception of deity is removed from the pagan ideal, may be seen by even a superficial study of the classics. Homer's gods and goddesses weep and bellow when wounded, but are not touched with the feeling of human infirmity (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>). "The gods," says Gladstone, "while they dispense afflictions upon earth, which are neither sweetened by love, nor elevated by a distinct disciplinary purpose, take care to keep themselves beyond all touch of grief or care."<p>"The gods ordain<p>The lot of man to suffer, while themselves<p>Are free from care."<p>"Iliad," xxiv., 525.<p>So Diana, when appealed to by the wretched Hippolytus for sympathy, replies:<p>"I see thy love, but must not shed a tear."<p>Euripides, "Hippolytes," 1396.<p>The Roman satirist unconsciously bears witness to the profound truthfulness and beauty of this picture of the weeping Savior, in the words: "Nature confesses that she gives the tenderest of hearts to the human race by giving them tears: this is the best part of our sensations" (Juvenal, "Satire" xv., 131-133). </body></html>
