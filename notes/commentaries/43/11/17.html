(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/5-6.htm" title="And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.">Acts 5:6-10</a>.) The whole tone of the narrative places the time of death at the point indicated by the summons to go into Judæa, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-7.htm" title="Then after that said he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.">John 11:7</a> (see Note there). Counting the parts of the days on which they set out and on which they arrived as included in the four days, in accordance with the Jewish method, we have two whole days and parts of two other days spent upon the journey. There is no indication that they halted on the way, but everything suggests rather that they went as quickly as possible. The common view, which supposes the place where John was baptising to have been on the southern Jordan, cannot be made consistent with this long journey; and it is usual to assume that Lazarus died on the day that the message reached the Lord, that after his death our Lord remained two days where He was, and that the fourth day was occupied on the journey to Bethany. It is believed that the meaning of the narrative is brought out more fully by the interpretation which has been followed above, and that the four days for the journey is perfectly natural on the supposition which has been adopted, that the journey was from <span class= "ital">Tellanihje,</span> which was north of the Sea of Galilee.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/11-17.htm" title="Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already....">John 11:17-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">When Jesus came, he found — </span>When Jesus and his disciples were come nigh to Bethany, they were told by some of the inhabitants, whom, it seems, they met accidentally, that Lazarus had been buried four days. Therefore, as a day or two must have been spent in making preparation for the burial, he could not well be less than five days dead when Jesus arrived. <span class="ital">Now Bethany </span>— The place where Lazarus had lived; <span class="ital">was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off </span>— Or somewhat less than two miles: so that he was well known in the city, had many friends there; <span class="ital">and many of the Jews, </span>who dwelt there, <span class="ital">came to Martha and Mary</span> — When the funeral was over; that they might <span class="ital">comfort them </span>— In their trouble for the loss of their brother. “The evangelist mentions the vicinity of Bethany to Jerusalem, and speaks of the company of friends that were with the two sisters, to show that by the direction of Providence this great miracle had many witnesses, some of whom were persons of note, and inhabitants of Jerusalem.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:17-32 Here was a house where the fear of God was, and on which his blessing rested; yet it was made a house of mourning. Grace will keep sorrow from the heart, but not from the house. When God, by his grace and providence, is coming towards us in ways of mercy and comfort, we should, like Martha, go forth by faith, hope, and prayer, to meet him. When Martha went to meet Jesus, Mary sat still in the house; this temper formerly had been an advantage to her, when it put her at Christ's feet to hear his word; but in the day of affliction, the same temper disposed her to melancholy. It is our wisdom to watch against the temptations, and to make use of the advantages of our natural tempers. When we know not what in particular to ask or expect, let us refer ourselves to God; let him do as seemeth him good. To enlarge Martha's expectations, our Lord declared himself to be the Resurrection and the Life. In every sense he is the Resurrection; the source, the substance, the first-fruits, the cause of it. The redeemed soul lives after death in happiness; and after the resurrection, both body and soul are kept from all evil for ever. When we have read or heard the word of Christ, about the great things of the other world, we should put it to ourselves, Do we believe this truth? The crosses and comforts of this present time would not make such a deep impression upon us as they do, if we believed the things of eternity as we ought. When Christ our Master comes, he calls for us. He comes in his word and ordinances, and calls us to them, calls us by them, calls us to himself. Those who, in a day of peace, set themselves at Christ's feet to be taught by him, may with comfort, in a day of trouble, cast themselves at his feet, to find favour with him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the grave - It was sometimes the custom to embalm the dead, but in this case it does not seem to have been done.

But possibly it is better judged by others, that Christ was not yet come into Bethany, but only to the place where he met Martha; because it is said after this, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-30.htm" title="Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.">John 11:30</a></span>, that <span class="ital">Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him; </span> which it is probable was at Lazarus’s sepulchre, out of the town, but near it, as all the Jewish burying places were; where he heard from the relation of Martha how long Lazarus had been buried. Our Saviour could have come sooner had he pleased, for though Bethabara was on the other side of Jordan, (so out of the confines of Judea), yet, if we may give any credit to those who have laboured in the study of places, it was not above four miles off Jerusalem, so as it could not be six miles from Bethany, which our Saviour could have travelled in a less time than four or five days.

The Alexandrian copy, and all the Oriental versions add, "to Bethany"; though it seems by what follows, that he was not come to the town itself, but near it; and it looks as if it was not far from Lazarus's grave; and it was usual to bury without the city; and here he had intelligence of his, Lazarus's, death, and how long he had been dead: <p>for he found he had lain in the grave four days already; it is very likely that he died the same day that Mary and Martha sent to Christ to acquaint him with his sickness, and the same day he was buried; for the Jews used to bury the same day a person died, and so they do now: and after Christ had this account, he stayed two days where he was, and on the third day, he proposed to his disciples to go into Judea; and very probably on that, or on the next day, which was the fourth, they set out and came to Bethany; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-17.htm" title="Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.">John 11:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐλθών</span>] into the neighbourhood of Bethany, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-30.htm" title="Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.">John 11:30</a>.

No material objection can be urged against this supposition, seeing that we do not know how far northwards in Peraea Jesus was sojourning when He received the message announcing the illness. The <span class="ital">usual</span> opinion—still entertained even by Luthardt, Ebrard, Gumlich, Hengstenberg, Godet—is, that Lazarus died and was buried on the very day on which Jesus received the message. Were this the case, Jesus must have remained that day and the two following in Peraea, and have first begun the journey on the fourth day (a journey which some suppose to have occupied merely ten or eleven hours, or even a shorter time),[80] and completed it on the same (Ebrard) or on the following day. On this supposition, however, Jesus would either not have known of the death of His friend before the third day, which would be quite opposed to the character and wording (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-6.htm" title="When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he stayed two days still in the same place where he was.">John 11:6</a>) of the narrative; or else He would know of it as soon as it happened, and therefore at the time of the arrival of the messenger, which would alone accord with the tone of the entire history; in this latter case, the two days’ postponement of His departure, which, notwithstanding He had resolved on, would be unnatural and aimless, and the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-4.htm" title="When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.">John 11:4</a>, which treat the sickness of Lazarus as still continuing, would have been inappropriate. Correctly, therefore, have Bengel (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm" title="These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.">John 11:11</a> with the comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-52.htm" title="Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend.

It would seem as if Christ’s miraculous power of knowing without the ordinary means of information was not in constant activity, but like His other miraculous powers was employed only on fitting occasions.

Jehu ordered Jezebel to be buried a few hours after death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-34.htm" title="And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter.">2 Kings 9:34</a>); Ananias and Sapphira were buried at once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-6.htm" title="And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.">Acts 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-10.htm" title="Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.">Acts 5:10</a>). If Christ started just after Lazarus died, as seems probable, the journey had occupied four days. This fits in well with the conclusion that Bethabara or Bethany was in the north of Palestine, possibly a little south of the Sea of Galilee; near Galilee it must have been (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-28.htm" title="These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing....">John 1:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-43.htm" title="The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and finds Philip, and said to him, Follow me.">John 1:43</a>). But on the other hand Lazarus may have died soon after Christ heard of his illness; in which case the journey occupied barely two days.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So</span>; or, <span class="accented">thereupon</span>; for <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> not infrequently indicates the relation between two narratives, as well as between two state-meats or arguments. <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus came into the neighborhood of the village</span> (see ver. 30), <span class="cmt_word">he found, on inquiry, that he</span> (Lazarus) <span class="cmt_word">already</span> <span class="cmt_word">during four days had been</span> <span class="cmt_word">in the grave</span>; or literally, <span class="accented">had had four days</span>. These four days are differently counted. Alford, Luthardt, Hengstenberg, Lange, Gorier, Westcott, and Moulton believe that this mention proves that Lazarus died and was buried on the day on which the message was sent, which, if it took one day to deliver, and if one day had been consumed in the return of Jesus, would leave the other two days as those of the delay in Peraea. Meyer and Ewald, with Bengel and Watkins, think that he died at the conclusion of the <span class="accented">delay</span>, that Jesus became aware of it, and told his disciples of it, and spent the two days, or parts of them, in the journey; that on the fourth day he reached Bethany. The former and usual view is the more obvious one, although it must turn ultimately on the position of Bethany beyond Jordan. If the recent speculations of the Palestine Exploration Society and Caspari be correct, the distance between the two Bethanys may have required at least two days for the journey, and therefore favors the latter interpretation. If Bethany (Bethabara) be near Jericho, the distance between them would be much less, and the former and usual reckoning must prevail. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Had lain in the grave four days already (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>Literally, found him having already four days in the tomb. </body></html>
