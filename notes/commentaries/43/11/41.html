Nevertheless, being about to raise Lazarus from the dead, he prayed for his resurrection, to make the persons present sensible that in working his miracles, he [as man] acted by the assistance, not of devils, as his enemies maliciously affirmed, but of God; and that this miracle, in particular, could not be effected without an immediate interposition of the divine power. The evangelist, it is true, does not say directly, either that Jesus prayed, or that he prayed for this end. But the thanksgiving, which he tells us he offered up, implies both.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">I know that thou hearest me always </span>— And art most ready to answer all my petitions. Jesus had access to his Father on every occasion, and success with him in every errand. And we may be sure his interest with God is not the less for his going to heaven; which may encourage us to depend on his intercession for us, and to put all our petitions into his hand, for we are sure that the Father hears him always. <span class="ital">Because of the people which stand by I said it, </span>&c. — I did not pray for my own sake, as if I had entertained any doubt of having power to do this miracle; (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-19.htm" title="Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise....">John 5:19-26</a>;) but I prayed for the people’s sake, to make them sensible that thou lovest me, hast sent me, and art continually with me; and that I do all in union with thee, and nothing of myself, without, or separate from thee. <span class="ital">And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice </span>— Suitable to the majestic part which he was now acting, and the dominion he had, even in the empire of death itself, as well as that it might appear to all present, that even the dead were subject to his voice; <span class="ital">Lazarus, come forth </span>— He could have raised Lazarus by a silent exertion of his will and power, and the undiscernible operation of the Spirit of life; but he did it by a call, a loud call, to signify the power then put forth for the raising of Lazarus, and the greatness of the work.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:33-46 Christ's tender sympathy with these afflicted friends, appeared by the troubles of his spirit. In all the afflictions of believers he is afflicted. His concern for them was shown by his kind inquiry after the remains of his deceased friend. Being found in fashion as a man, he acts in the way and manner of the sons of men. It was shown by his tears. He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. Tears of compassion resemble those of Christ. But Christ never approved that sensibility of which many are proud, while they weep at mere tales of distress, but are hardened to real woe. He sets us an example to withdraw from scenes of giddy mirth, that we may comfort the afflicted. And we have not a High Priest who cannot be touched with a feeling of our infirmities. It is a good step toward raising a soul to spiritual life, when the stone is taken away, when prejudices are removed, and got over, and way is made for the word to enter the heart. If we take Christ's word, and rely on his power and faithfulness, we shall see the glory of God, and be happy in the sight. Our Lord Jesus has taught us, by his own example, to call God Father, in prayer, and to draw nigh to him as children to a father, with humble reverence, yet with holy boldness. He openly made this address to God, with uplifted eyes and loud voice, that they might be convinced the Father had sent him as his beloved Son into the world. He could have raised Lazarus by the silent exertion of his power and will, and the unseen working of the Spirit of life; but he did it by a loud call. This was a figure of the gospel call, by which dead souls are brought out of the grave of sin: and of the sound of the archangel's trumpet at the last day, with which all that sleep in the dust shall be awakened, and summoned before the great tribunal. The grave of sin and this world, is no place for those whom Christ has quickened; they must come forth. Lazarus was thoroughly revived, and returned not only to life, but to health. The sinner cannot quicken his own soul, but he is to use the means of grace; the believer cannot sanctify himself, but he is to lay aside every weight and hinderance. We cannot convert our relatives and friends, but we should instruct, warn, and invite them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lifted up his eyes - In an attitude of prayer.

The thanks which Jesus renders here are evidently in view of the fact that power had been committed to him to raise up Lazarus. On account of the people, and the signal proof which would be furnished of the truth of his mission, he expressed his thanks to God. In all his actions, he recognized his union to the Father, and his dependence upon him as Mediator. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. Jesus lifted up his eyes&#8212;an expression marking His calm solemnity. (Compare Joh 17:1).<p>Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me&#8212;rather, "heardest Me," referring to a specific prayer offered by Him, probably on intelligence of the case reaching Him (Joh 11:3, 4); for His living and loving oneness with the Father was maintained and manifested in the flesh, not merely by the spontaneous and uninterrupted outgoing of Each to Each in spirit, but by specific actings of faith and exercises of prayer about each successive case as it emerged. He prayed (says Luthardt well) not for what He wanted, but for the manifestation of what He had; and having the bright consciousness of the answer in the felt liberty to ask it, and the assurance that it was at hand, He gives thanks for this with a grand simplicity before performing the act.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The servants, or friends, about the grave, removeth the stone from the mouth of the cave, within which the dead corpse of Lazarus lay. Christ, before his thanksgiving to his Father, is said to have <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">lifted up his eyes; </span> a posture often used in men’s addresses to God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm" title="I will lift up my eyes to the hills, from where comes my help.">Psalm 121:1</a></span>, and <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/123-1.htm" title="To you lift I up my eyes, O you that dwell in the heavens.">Psalm 123:1</a></span>, as an indication of their belief that heaven is God’s throne: though he filleth heaven and earth, yet heaven is his court, where he most gloriously showeth himself, the earth but his footstool. We read here of nothing that Christ had said before, yet he giveth thanks here to his Father that he had heard him. The meaning is, thou hast willed, or pleased to grant, those things which I desired. It is very hard to determine, whether Christ had used some audible words before this, upon this occasion, in prayer to his Father, which the evangelist could not or did not set down; or whether he only groaned in his spirit, as was said before, by those groans not only expressing his sorrow for Lazarus’s death, or rather sympathy with the afflictions of Mary and Martha, but also his desires to his Father, that he might be again restored to life; and his second groaning, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-38.htm" title="Jesus therefore again groaning in himself comes to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay on it.">John 11:38</a></span>, was of that nature: which groanings in the saints God understandeth, knowing the <span class="ital">mind of the Spirit, </span> making <span class="ital">intercession for the saints according to the will of God</span> (as the apostle teacheth us, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-27.htm" title="And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.">Romans 8:27</a></span>); much more did the Father, who was one in nature, essence, and will with the Son, understand them in him. Nothing in these cases can be determined, much less can any conclude from hence, that there is no need of our using any words in our prayers; for although there be no simple, absolute necessity that we should use them in order to God’s knowledge of what we need, and would have; for he that searcheth the heart, knows what we need, and what we desire, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-8.htm" title="Be not you therefore like to them: for your Father knows what things you have need of, before you ask him.">Matthew 6:8</a></span>; yet there is a necessity for our words, in order to our obeying God’s command, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-2.htm" title="Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say to him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.">Hosea 14:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-2.htm" title="And he said to them, When you pray, say, Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.

Jesus <span class="ital">knows</span> that His prayer, that God would suffer Him to raise Lazarus to life,—a prayer which He had previously offered up in stillness, perhaps only in the inarticulate yearnings of His heart,—has been heard, and He <span class="ital">thanks</span> God for hearing it.

Not that He offers thanks because the hearing of His prayer was unexpected and unhoped for (<span class="greekheb">εἶπον</span>); no, He for His part (<span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span>) knew, even whilst He was asking God in stillness, that God always heard Him;[89] but because of the people standing by, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some have stumbled at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-42.htm" title="And I knew that you hear me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that you have sent me.">John 11:42</a>, and looked on it either as <span class="ital">spurious</span> (Dieffenbach in Bertholdt’s <span class="ital">Krit.

But it is just He, the One who is most intimate with the Father, who may indulge in reflection even in prayer, if His reflections relate to God, and <span class="ital">are</span> prayer. The opposite judgment applies an arbitrary standard to the subject. Moreover, if it had been <span class="ital">his own</span> reflection, John would probably have said: <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοὺς Ἰουδαίους</span> instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὌΧΛΟΝ</span></span></span>.

Therefore He thanks the Father because it was essential that the miracle should be referred to its real source, and that all should recognise that it was the Father who had sent this power among men.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">41</span>. <span class="ital">from the place where the dead was laid</span>] These words, are omitted by an overwhelming number of authorities.

They lifted the stone, and <span class="cmt_word">Jesus lifted up his eyes</span> <span class="accented">to heaven</span>. This is not to be taken as an ordinary prayer, but a thanksgiving for prayer already heard. "Jesus lifted up his eyes," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to heaven - to that sublime symbol of the infinite activity of God, which surrounds us day and night, and which is in numerous religious systems made a type and image of the Divine Being himself; nor does our modern conception of the universe dethrone it from this high place. Christ's language is thanksgiving that God has already heard him. Godet and Hengstenberg say that Jesus thanked God in anticipation of the miracle, as though it were already done. Meyer and Alford look back to some earlier prayers. But surely there is some reason for the thanksgiving. The stone is <span class="accented">lifted</span>, or <span class="accented">removed</span>; there lies the corpse, but no dank sepulchral vapor issues from it; rather some sign is given that prayer offered by Christ had been already heard, and that death has not made the havoc with the frame which would otherwise have occurred. <span class="cmt_word">Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me</span>. When he uttered the prayer we cannot say; but we know that his mind was greatly exercised concerning his friend before he left Peraea. His words confess that his wishes have been in harmony with the Divine eternal will. So elsewhere the Lord tells his disciples, "If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "your desires will be in harmony with the Divine purpose; you will not be able to pray for anything either temporal or spiritual which God will not bestow, has not indeed prepared himself to bestow and you to receive." This is the true mystery and meaning of prayer. The hypothesis of the twofold nature of Christ, instead of being shipwrecked on the fact of his prayers and intercessions, throws light on the very nature of prayer itself. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>From the place where the dead was laid<p>Omit. </body></html>
