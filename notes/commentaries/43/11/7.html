But they expressed some unwillingness to undertake the journey; not imagining that it was proposed on Lazarus’s account, whom they supposed out of danger, because Jesus had said of his sickness, that it was not unto death. <span class="ital">His disciples say, The Jews of late sought to stone thee, </span>&c. — It seems the attempts which the inhabitants of Jerusalem lately made upon their Master’s life had frightened them exceedingly. <span class="ital">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? — </span>The Jews always divided the space from sunrise to sunset, whether the days were longer or shorter, into twelve parts, so that the hours of their day were all the year the same in number, though much shorter in winter than in summer. <span class="ital">If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not </span>— As the hours of the day are appointed for the various works necessary for human life, and as he who travels in the daytime needs not be afraid of stumbling, because he has the sun, the light of this world, to show him his way; even so the man who has a season allotted him for performing God’s work, and at the same time the light of God’s word showing him what it is, and the divine call requiring him to engage in it, needs not be afraid of any danger he exposes himself to in performing it, God, whom he serves, being always able to preserve him. Jesus, however, intended this to be applied to himself, as if he had said, So there is such a space, a determinate time, which God has allotted me: during that time I stumble not, how many snares soever may be laid for me. <span class="ital">But if a man walk in the night </span>— If a man undertake God’s work at an improper season, without a divine call requiring him to undertake it, or without understanding the will of God and his duty: if he has not light from God, through his word and Spirit; and if Divine Providence does no longer protect him; <span class="ital">he stumbleth </span>— He may be justly afraid of the danger to which he exposes himself: he will fall into error, sin, and misery. <span class="ital">Because there is no light in him </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">in it, </span>as <span class="greekheb">εν αυτω</span>, should be translated, referring to the noun, <span class="greekheb">κοσμου</span>, <span class="ital">world, </span>in the end of the preceding verse. For his stumbling in the night is occasioned by the want of that which prevents his stumbling in the day, namely, light, the sun not being above the horizon. Dr. Campbell, however, thinks that, <span class="ital">in it, </span>or, <span class="ital">in him, </span>is better omitted in English, where it would encumber rather than enlighten the expression. He therefore reads, <span class="ital">He stumbleth because there is no light. </span>“By these words,” says Cocceius, “our Lord reminds his disciples that he was the light of the world, and that as long as he was in the world he must necessarily shine; and that there was no danger if they walked with him; he also hints hereby the stated time fixed for him to be in the world, and the consequent darkness of those who should reject his light, and not walk in it, which they should enjoy always, who obeyed his word and followed his example.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:7-10 Christ never brings his people into any danger but he goes with them in it. We are apt to think ourselves zealous for the Lord, when really we are only zealous for our wealth, credit, ease, and safety; we have therefore need to try our principles. But our day shall be lengthened out, till our work is done, and our testimony finished. A man has comfort and satisfaction while in the way of his duty, as set forth by the word of God, and determined by the providence of God. Christ, wherever he went, walked in the day; and so shall we, if we follow his steps. If a man walks in the way of his heart, and according to the course of this world, if he consults his own carnal reasonings more than the will and glory of God, he falls into temptations and snares. He stumbles, because there is no light in him; for light in us is to our moral actions, that which light about us to our natural actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He abode two days - Probably Lazarus died soon after the messengers left him. Jesus knew that (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a>), and did not hasten to Judea, but remained two days longer where he was, that there might not be the possibility of doubt that he was dead, so that when he came there he had been dead four days, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-39.htm">John 11:39</a>. This shows, moreover, that he intended to raise him up.

This was about a day's journey, and it renders it probable that Lazarus died soon after the message was sent.
