The difficulty has arisen from taking the words “I will come again,” as necessarily referring to the same time as those which follow—“I will receive you unto Myself,” whereas they are in the present tense, and should be literally rendered, <span class= "ital">I am coming again.</span> They refer rather, as the same words refer when used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a>, to His constant spiritual presence in their midst; whereas the reception of them to Himself is to be understood of the complete union which will accompany that spiritual presence; a union which will be commenced in this life, advanced by the death of individuals, and completed in the final coming again. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm" title="Father, I will that they also, whom you have given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which you have given me: for you loved me before the foundation of the world.">John 17:24</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/john/14.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>John<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE FORERUNNER<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-2.htm" title="In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.

They carry us up into the unseen world, and beyond time; and yet a little child can lay hold on them, and mourning hearts and dying men find peace and sweetness in them. A very familiar image underlies them. It was customary for travellers in those old days to send some of their party on in advance, to find lodging and make arrangements for them in some great city. Many a time one or other of the disciples had been ‘sent before His face into every place where He Himself should come.’ On that very morning two of them had gone in, at His bidding, from Bethany to make ready the table at which they were sitting. Christ here takes that office upon Himself. The emblem is homely, the thing meant is transcendent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Not less wonderful is the blending of majesty and lowliness. The office which He takes upon Himself is that of an inferior and a servant. And yet the discharge of it, in the present case, implies His authority over every corner of the universe, His immortal life, and the sufficiency of His presence to make a heaven. Nor can we fail to notice the blending of another pair of opposites: His certainty of His impending death, and His certainty, notwithstanding and thereby, of His continual work and His final return, are inseparably interlaced here. How comes it that, in all His premonitions of His death, Jesus Christ never spoke about it as failure or as the interruption or end of His activity, but always as the transition to, and the condition of, His wider work? ‘I go, and if I go I return, and take you to Myself.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So, then, there are three things here, the departure with its purpose, the return, and the perfected union.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The Departure.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Our Lord’s going away from that little group was a journey in two stages. Calvary was the first; Olivet was the second. He means by the phrase the whole continuous process which begins with His death and ends in His ascension. Both are embraced in His words, and each co-operates to the attainment of the great purpose.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He prepares a place for us by His death. The High Priest, in the ancient ritual, once a year was privileged to lift the heavy veil and pass into the darkened chamber, where only the light between the cherubim was visible, because he bore in his hand the blood of the sacrifice. But in our New Testament system the path into ‘the holiest of all,’ the realisation of the most intimate fellowship with heavenly things and communion with God Himself, are made possible, and the way patent for every foot, because Jesus has died. And as the communion upon earth, so the perfecting of the communion in the heavens. Who of us could step within those awful sanctities, or stand serene amidst the region of eternal light and stainless purity, unless, in His death, He had borne the sins of the world, and, having ‘overcome’ its ‘sharpness’ by enduring its blow, had ‘opened the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers’?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Old legends tell us of magic gates that resisted all attempts to force them, but upon which, if one drop of a certain blood fell, they flew open. And so, by His death, Christ has opened the gates and made the heaven of perfect purity a dwelling-place for sinful men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the second stage of His departure is that which more eminently is in Christ’s mind here. He prepares a place for us by His entrance into and His dwelling in the heavenly places. The words are obscure because we have but few others with which to compare them, and no experience by which to interpret them. We know so little about the matter that it is not wise to say much; but though there be vast tracts of darkness round the little spot of light, this should only make the spot of light more vivid and more precious. We know little, but we know enough for mind and heart to rest upon. Our ignorance of the ways in which Christ by His ascension prepares a heaven for His followers should neither breed doubt nor disregard of His assurance that He does.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If Christ had not ascended, would there have been ‘a place’ at all? He has gone with a human body, which, glorified as it is, still has relations to space, and must be somewhere. And we may even say that His ascending up on high has made a place where His servants are. But apart from that suggestion, which, perhaps, is going beyond our limits, we may see that Christ’s presence in heaven is needful to make it a heaven for poor human souls. There, as here {Scripture assures us}, and throughout eternity as to-day, Jesus Christ is the Mediator of all human knowledge and possession of God. It is from Him and through Him that there come to men, whether they be men on earth or men in the heavens, all that they know, all that they hope, all that they enjoy, of the wisdom, love, beauty, peace, power, which flow from God. Take away from the heaven of the Christian expectation that which comes to the spirit through Jesus Christ, and you have nothing left. He and His mediation and ministration alone make the brightness and the blessedness of that high state. The very glories of all that lies beyond the veil would have an aspect appalling and bewildering to us, unless our Brother were there. Like some poor savages brought into a great city, or rustics into the presence of a king and his court, we should be ill at ease amidst the glories and solemnities of that future life unless we saw standing there our Kinsman, to whom we can turn, and who makes it possible for us to feel that it is home. Christ’s presence makes heaven the home of our hearts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Not only did He go to prepare a place, but He is continuously preparing it for us all through the ages. We have to think of a double form of the work of Christ, His past work in His earthly life, and His present in His exaltation. We have to think of a double form of His present activity-His work with and in us here on earth, and His work for us there in the heavens. We have to think of a double form of His work in the heavens-that which the Scripture represents in a metaphor, the full comprehension of which surpasses our present powers and experiences, as being His priestly intercession; and that which my text represents in a metaphor, perhaps a little more level to our apprehension, as being His preparing a place for us. Behind the veil there is a working Christ, who, in the heavens, is preparing a place for all that love Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. In the next place, note the Return.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The purpose of our Lord’s departure, as set forth by Himself here, guarantees for us His coming back again. That is the force of the simple argumentation of my text, and of the pathetic and soothing repetition of the sweet words, ‘I go to prepare a place for you; and if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto Myself.’ Because the departure had for its purpose the preparing of the place, therefore it is necessarily followed by a return. He who went away as the Forerunner has not done His work until He comes back, and, as Guide, leads those for whom He had prepared the place to the place which He had prepared for them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now that return of our Lord, like His departure, may be considered as having two stages. Unquestionably the main meaning and application of the words is to that final and personal coming which stands at the end of history, and to which the hopes of every Christian soul ought to be steadfastly directed. He will ‘so come in like manner as’ He has gone. We are not to water down such words as these into anything short of a return precisely corresponding in its method to the departure; and as the departure was visible, corporeal, literal, personal, and local, so the return is to be visible, corporeal, literal, personal, local too. He is to come as He went, a visible Manhood, only throned amongst the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. This is the aim that He sets before Him in His departure. He leaves in order that He may come back again.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And, oh, dear friends! remember-and let us live in the strength of the remembrance-that this return ought to be the prominent subject of Christian aspiration and desire. There is much about the conception of that solemn return, with all the convulsions that attend it, and the judgment of which it is preliminary, that may well make men’s hearts chill within them. But for you and me, if we have any love in our hearts and loyalty in our spirits to that King, ‘His coming’ should be ‘prepared as the morning,’ and we should join in the great burst of rapture of many a psalm, which calls upon rocks and hills to break forth into singing, and trees of the field to clap their hands, because He cometh as the King to judge the earth. His own parable tells us how we ought to regard His coming. When the fig-tree’s branch begins to supple, and the little leaves to push their way through the polished stem, then we know that summer is at hand. His coming should be as the approach of that glorious, fervid time, in which the sunshine has tenfold brilliancy and power, the time of ripened harvests and matured fruits, the time of joy for all creatures that love the sun. It should be the glad hope of all His servants.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We have a double witness to bear in the midst of this as of every generation. One half of the witness stretches backwards to the Cross, and proclaims ‘Christ has come’; the other reaches onwards to the Throne, and proclaims ‘Christ will come.’ Between these two high uplifted piers swings the chain of the world’s history, which closes with the return, to judge and to save, of the Lord who came to die and has gone to prepare a place for us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But do not let us forget that we may well take another point of view than this. Scripture knows of many comings of the Lord preliminary to, and in principle one with, His last coming. For nations all great crises of their history are ‘comings of the Lord,’ the Judge, and we are strictly in the line of Scripture analogy when, in reference to individuals, we see in each single death a true coming of the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That is the point of view in which we ought to look upon a Christian’s death-bed. ‘The Master is come, and calleth for thee.’ Beyond all secondary causes, deeper than disease or accident, lies the loving will of Him who is the Lord of life and of death. Death is Christ’s minister, ‘mighty and beauteous, though his face be dark,’ and he, too, stands amidst the ranks of the ‘ministering spirits sent forth to minister to them that shall be heirs of salvation.’ It is Christ that says of one, ‘I will that this man tarry,’ and to another, ‘Go!’ and he goeth. But whensoever a Christian man lies down to die, Christ says, ‘Come!’ and he comes. How that thought should hallow the death-chamber as with the print of the Master’s feet! How it should quiet our hearts and dry our tears! How it should change the whole aspect of that ‘shadow feared of man’! With Him for our companion, the lonely road will not be dreary; and though in its anticipation, our timid hearts may often be ready to say, ‘Surely the darkness shall cover me,’ if we have Him by our sides, ‘even the night shall be light about us.’ The dying martyr beneath the city wall lifted up his face to the heavens, and said, ‘Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!’ It was the echo of the Master’s promise, ‘I will come again, and receive you to Myself.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Lastly, notice the Perfected Union.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The departure for such a purpose necessarily involved the return again. Both are stages in the process, which is perfected by complete union-’That where I am there ye may be also.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Christ, as I have been saying, is Heaven. His presence is all that we need for peace, for joy, for purity, for rest, for love, for growth. To be ‘with Him,’ as He tells us in another part of these wonderful last words in the upper chamber, is to ‘behold His glory.’ And to behold His glory, as John tells us in his Epistle, is to be like Him. So Christ’s presence means the communication to us of all the lustre of His radiance, of all the whiteness of His purity, of all the depth of His blessedness, and of a share in His wondrous dominion. His glorified manhood will pass into ours, and they that are with Him where He is will rest as in the centre and home of their spirits, and find Him all-sufficient. His presence is my Heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That is almost all we know. Oh! it is more than all we need to know. The curtain is the picture. It is because what is there transcends in glory all our present experience that Scripture can only hint at it and describe it by negations-such as ‘no night,’ ‘no sorrow,’ ‘no tears,’ ‘former things passed away’; and by symbols of glory and lustre gathered from all that is loftiest and noblest in human buildings and society. But all these are but secondary and poor. The living heart of the hope, and the lambent centre of the brightness, is, ‘So shall we ever be with the Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And it is enough. It is enough to make the bond of union between us in the outer court and them in the holy place. Parted friends will fix to look at the same star at the same moment of the night and feel some union; and if we from amidst the clouds of earth, and they from amidst the pure radiance of their heaven, turn our eyes to the same Christ, we are not far apart. If He be the companion of each of us, He reaches a hand to each, and, clasping it, the parted ones are united; and ‘whether we wake or sleep we live together,’ because we both live with Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Brother! Is Jesus Christ so much to you that a heaven which consists in nearness and likeness to Him has any attraction for you? Let Him be your Saviour, your Sacrifice, your Helper, your Companion. Obey Him as your King, love Him as your Friend, trust Him as your All. And be sure that then the darkness will be but the shadow of His hand, and instead of dreading death as that which separates you from life and love and action and joy, you will be able to meet it peacefully, as that which rends the thin veil, and unites you with Him who is the Heaven of heavens.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He has gone to prepare a place for us. And if we will let Him, He will prepare us for the place, and then come and lead us thither. ‘Thou wilt show me the path of life’ which leads through death. ‘In Thy presence is fullness of joy, and at Thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.’<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-11 Here are three words, upon any of which stress may be laid. Upon the word troubled. Be not cast down and disquieted. The word heart. Let your heart be kept with full trust in God. The word your. However others are overwhelmed with the sorrows of this present time, be not you so. Christ's disciples, more than others, should keep their minds quiet, when everything else is unquiet. Here is the remedy against this trouble of mind, Believe. By believing in Christ as the Mediator between God and man, we gain comfort. The happiness of heaven is spoken of as in a father's house. There are many mansions, for there are many sons to be brought to glory. Mansions are lasting dwellings. Christ will be the Finisher of that of which he is the Author or Beginner; if he have prepared the place for us, he will prepare us for it. Christ is the sinner's Way to the Father and to heaven, in his person as God manifest in the flesh, in his atoning sacrifice, and as our Advocate. He is the Truth, as fulfilling all the prophecies of a Saviour; believing which, sinners come by him the Way. He is the Life, by whose life-giving Spirit the dead in sin are quickened. Nor can any man draw nigh God as a Father, who is not quickened by Him as the Life, and taught by Him as the Truth, to come by Him as the Way. By Christ, as the Way, our prayers go to God, and his blessings come to us; this is the Way that leads to rest, the good old Way. He is the Resurrection and the Life. All that saw Christ by faith, saw the Father in Him. In the light of Christ's doctrine, they saw God as the Father of lights; and in Christ's miracles, they saw God as the God of power. The holiness of God shone in the spotless purity of Christ's life. We are to believe the revelation of God to man in Christ; for the works of the Redeemer show forth his own glory, and God in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In my Father's house - Most interpreters understand this of heaven, as the special dwelling-place or palace of God; but it may include the universe, as the abode of the omnipresent God.<p>Are many mansions - The word rendered "mansions" means either the act of dwelling in any place (<a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>, "we will make our abode with him"), or it means the place where one dwells. It is taken from the verb to remain, and signifies the place where one dwells or remains. It is applied by the Greek writers to the tents or temporary habitations which soldiers pitch in their marches. It denotes a dwelling of less permanency than the word house. It is commonly understood as affirming that in heaven there is ample room to receive all who will come; that therefore the disciples might be sure that they would not be excluded. Some have understood it as affirming that there will be different grades in the joys of heaven; that some of the mansions of the saints will be nearer to God than others, agreeably to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-40.htm">1 Corinthians 15:40-41</a>. But perhaps this passage may have a meaning which has not occurred to interpreters.<p>Jesus was consoling his disciples, who were affected with grief at the idea of his separation. To comfort them he addresses them in this language: "The universe is the dwelling-place of my Father. All is his house. Whether on earth or in heaven, we are still in his habitation. In that vast abode of God there are many mansions. The earth is one of them, heaven is another. Whether here or there, we are still in the house, in one of the mansions of our Father, in one of the apartments of his vast abode. This we ought continually to feel, and to rejoice that we are permitted to occupy any part of his dwelling-place. Nor does it differ much whether we are in this mansion or another. It should not be a matter of grief when we are called to pass from one part of this vast habitation of God to another. I am indeed about to leave you, but I am going only to another part of the vast dwelling-place of God. I shall still be in the same universal habitation with you; still in the house of the same God; and am going for an important purpose - to fit up another abode for your eternal dwelling." If this be the meaning, then there is in the discourse true consolation. We see that the death of a Christian is not to be dreaded, nor is it an event over which we should immoderately weep. It is but removing from one apartment of God's universal dwelling-place to another - one where we shall still be in his house, and still feel the same interest in all that pertains to his kingdom. And especially the removal of the Saviour from the earth was an event over which Christians should rejoice, for he is still in the house of God, and still preparing mansions of rest for His people.<p>If it were not so ... - I have concealed from you no truth. You have been cherishing this hope of a future abode with God. Had it been ill founded I would have told you plainly, as I have told you other things. Had any of you been deceived, as Judas was, I would have made it known to you, as I did to him."<p>I go to prepare a place for you - By his going is meant his death and ascent to heaven. The figure here is taken from one who is on a journey, who goes before his companions to provide a place to lodge in, and to make the necessary preparations for their entertainment. It evidently means that he, by the work he was yet to perform in heaven, would secure their admission there, and obtain for them the blessings of eternal life. That work would consist mainly in his intercession, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12-13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25-27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>.<p>That where I am - This language could be used by no one who was not then in the place of which he was speaking, and it is just such language as one would naturally use who was both God and man - in reference to his human nature, speaking of his going to his Father; and in reference to his divine nature, speaking as if he was then with God.<p>Ye may be also - This was language eminently fitted to comfort them. Though about to leave them, yet he would not always be absent. He would come again at the day of judgment and gather all his friends to himself, and they should be ever with him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>. So shall all Christians be with him. And so, when we part with a beloved Christian friend by death, we may feel assured that the separation will not be eternal. We shall meet again, and dwell in a place where there shall be no more separation and no more tears. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

So as this is a third argument by which our Lord comforteth his disciples as to their trouble conceived for the want of His bodily presence with them, from the certainty of his return to them, and the end and consequent of his return: the end was to receive them to himself; the consequent, their eternal abiding with Christ where he was. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And if I go and prepare a place for you,....

And they took Jesus, and led him away.">John 19:16</a>). There is no doubt about the meaning of the going away; but the coming again may have various meanings, and apparently not always the same one throughout this discourse; either the Resurrection, or the gift of the Paraclete, or the death of individuals, or the presence of Christ in his Church, or the Second Advent at the last day. The last seems to be the meaning here (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-39.htm" title="And this is the Father's will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day....">John 6:39-40</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-3.htm" title="And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.">John 14:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐάν</span>, <span class="ital">if</span>) A mild particle, used for <span class="greekheb">ὅταν</span>, <span class="ital">when</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἔρχομαι</span>, <span class="ital">I come</span> [am coming]) The Present, as concerning His speedy coming: <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-18.htm" title="I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.">John 14:18</a>, “I will not leave you comfortless; <span class="ital">I come</span> to you.” It is a peculiar idiom of speech, that the Lord is not wont to say, <span class="ital">I will come</span>, but <span class="ital">I come</span>, even when another verb in the future tense is added. Comp., however, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a> concerning the forerunner [<span class="greekheb">Ἡλίας ἔρχεται</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀποκαταστήσει πάντα</span>], and the LXX., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm" title="So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.">2 Samuel 5:3</a> [<span class="greekheb">ἔρχονται</span>—<span class="greekheb">οἱ πρεσβύτεροι</span>—<span class="greekheb">καὶ διέθετο αὐτοῖς ὁ βασιλεύς</span>].—<span class="greekheb">καί</span>, <span class="ital">and</span>) The end of My departure infers [carries with it] this very consequence, that I am to come again.—<span class="greekheb">πρὸς ἐμαυτόν</span>, <span class="ital">to Myself</span>) An expression full of majesty.

I am coming to you, in my glory and power, and in my victory in you as well as for you over death and Hades, to receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. The full perspective of the Lord's approach to faithful souls is given in the extraordinary pregnancy of the "I am coming." Not until he comes m all his glory will the words be perfectly fulfilled; but the early Church, on the basis of communion with Christ himself in the power of his Spirit, expected that Christ had come and taken to himself one by one those who died in the faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>). Thus Stephen expected the Lord to receive his spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59</a>); and the dying thief was to be <span class="accented">with him</span>, in Paradise; and Paul knew that to be from home, so far as body is concerned, was to be "at home or present with the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>). "To be with Christ" was "far better" than to labor on in the flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>). The highest thought of peace and love was to the apostles union and presence with Christ. Our Lord asserts here that by his very nearness to them he will make their heaven for them. How soon this wonderful idea spread among men! Within twenty years, Thessalonians were comforted about their pious dead, with the thought that they slept in Jesus, and would together with them be "forever with the Lord." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>If I go (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;)<p>&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, go, of going with a definite object.

Not to be limited to the Lord's second and glorious coming at the last day, nor to any special coming, such as Pentecost, though these are all included in the expression; rather to be taken of His continual coming and presence by the Holy Spirit. "Christ is, in fact, from the moment of His resurrection, ever coming into the world and to the Church, and to men as the risen Lord" (Westcott).<p>And receive (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Here the future tense, will receive. Rev., therefore, much better: I come again and will receive you. The change of tense is intentional, the future pointing to the future personal reception of the believer through death. Christ is with the disciple alway, continually "coming" to him, unto the end of the world. Then He will receive him into that immediate fellowship, where he "shall see Him as He is." The verb &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; is used in the New Testament of taking along with (<a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/4-5.htm">Matthew 4:5</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-33.htm">Acts 16:33</a>, note): of taking to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>): of taking from, receiving by transmission; so mostly in Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-17.htm">Colossians 4:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>, etc. See also <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-40.htm">Matthew 24:40</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-41.htm">Matthew 24:41</a>). It is scarcely fanciful to see the first two meanings blended in the use of the verb in this passage. Jesus, by the Spirit, takes His own along with Him through life, and then takes them to His side at death. He himself conducts them to Himself.<p>Iam<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-34.htm">John 7:34</a>. </body></html>
