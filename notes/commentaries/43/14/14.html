In the second clause of the verse the pronoun “I” bears the stress. “I (on My part) will do it.” In the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-16.htm" title="You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.">John 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-23.htm" title="And in that day you shall ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, Whatever you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.">John 16:23</a> the Father is thought of as answering the prayer. The passage from one thought to the other is possible because the Father and Son are thought of as one.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:12-17 Whatever we ask in Christ's name, that shall be for our good, and suitable to our state, he shall give it to us. To ask in Christ's name, is to plead his merit and intercession, and to depend upon that plea. The gift of the Spirit is a fruit of Christ's mediation, bought by his merit, and received by his intercession. The word used here, signifies an advocate, counsellor, monitor, and comforter. He would abide with the disciples to the end of time; his gifts and graces would encourage their hearts. The expressions used here and elsewhere, plainly denote a person, and the office itself includes all the Divine perfections. The gift of the Holy Ghost is bestowed upon the disciples of Christ, and not on the world. This is the favour God bears to his chosen. As the source of holiness and happiness, the Holy Spirit will abide with every believer for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whatsoever ye shall ask - This promise referred particularly to the apostles in their work of spreading the gospel; it is, however, true of all Christians, if what they ask is in faith, and according to the will of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14</a>.<p>In my name - This is equivalent to saying on my account, or for my sake. If a man who has money in a bank authorizes us to draw it, we are said to do it in his name. If a son authorizes us to apply to his father for aid because we are his friends, we do it in the name of the son, and the favor will be bestowed on us from the regard which the parent has to his son, and through him to all his friends. So we are permitted to apply to God in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, because God is in him well pleased <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, and because we are the friends of his Son he answers our requests. Though we are undeserving, yet he loves us on account of his Son, and because he sees in us his image. No privilege is greater than that of approaching God in the name of his Son; no blessings of salvation can be conferred on any who do not come in his name.<p>That will I do - Being exalted, he will be possessed of all power in heaven and earth <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, and he therefore could fulfill all their desires.<p>That the Father may be glorified in the Son - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13, 14. whatsoever ye &#8230; ask in my name&#8212;as Mediator.<p>that will I do&#8212;as Head and Lord of the kingdom of God.

These words are much, the same with the former, and have been thought, by some, to have crept into the text from the margin; though they seem rather to be repeated by Christ, the more to strengthen and confirm the faith of his disciples in this matter; that whatsoever they asked <p>in my name, either calling upon it, he being equally the object of prayer with the Father, or making mention of it, pleading the merits of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice; whatever was according to the will of God, was for his glory, and their real good, he would do it for them, as well when absent from them, as present with them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-14.htm" title="If you shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.">John 14:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ αὐτὸ λέγει βεβαιῶν μάλιστα τὸν λόγον</span>, Euth.
