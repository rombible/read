This verse points out the successive degrees which led up to the full manifestation of Christ. The first step is the moral apprehension and practical observance of our Lord’s commandments, which necessarily result from love to Christ.<p><span class= "bld">He it is that loveth me.</span>—The next step is the special receptivity of the Father’s love which he who loves Christ possesses, and therefore there is a special sense in which the Father loves him. The words express with fulness of emphasis, “<span class= "ital">He</span> it is, and he only.”<p><span class= "bld">And I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</span>—The special love of the Son follows from the special love of the Father, and is accompanied by the full manifestation of the Son. This is further explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.">John 14:23</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:18-24 Christ promises that he would continue his care of his disciples. I will not leave you orphans, or fatherless, for though I leave you, yet I leave you this comfort, I will come to you. I will come speedily to you at my resurrection. I will come daily to you in my Spirit; in the tokens of his love, and visits of his grace. I will come certainly at the end of time. Those only that see Christ with an eye of faith, shall see him for ever: the world sees him no more till his second coming; but his disciples have communion with him in his absence. These mysteries will be fully known in heaven. It is a further act of grace, that they should know it, and have the comfort of it. Having Christ's commands, we must keep them. And having them in our heads, we must keep them in our hearts and lives. The surest evidence of our love to Christ is, obedience to the laws of Christ. There are spiritual tokens of Christ and his love given to all believers. Where sincere love to Christ is in the heart, there will be obedience. Love will be a commanding, constraining principle; and where love is, duty follows from a principle of gratitude. God will not only love obedient believers, but he will take pleasure in loving them, will rest in love to them. He will be with them as his home. These privileges are confined to those whose faith worketh by love, and whose love to Jesus leads them to keep his commandments. Such are partakers of the Holy Spirit's new-creating grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that hath ... - This intimate union is further manifested by these facts:<p>1. That true love to Jesus will produce obedience. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>.<p>2. That those who love him will be loved of the Father, showing that there is a union between the Father and the Son.<p>3. That Jesus also will love them, evincing still the same union. Religion is love. The love of one holy being or object is the love of all. The kingdom of God is one. His people, though called by different names, are one. They are united to each other and to God, and the bond which unites the whole kingdom in one is love.<p>Will manifest myself to him - To manifest is to show, to make appear, to place before the eyes so that an object may be seen. This means that Jesus would so show himself to his followers that they should see and know that he was their Saviour. In what way this is done, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Having Christ’s commandments and keeping them: they must both concur to make a true indication of our love to Christ. It is possible that men may have Christ’s commandments in their ears, in their notion, in their mouths, and yet not keep them; they may hear them, they may know and remember them, they may talk of them, yet they may not keep them; for keeping them denotes universal, diligent and industrious, steady and constant obedience to them; and this alone will speak our love to Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. And if any man thus declareth his love to Christ, Christ declareth, that both he and his Father will take a pleasure and delight in him to do him good; and he shall not live only under the real benefits of his love to him, but under the sensible manifestations of it. Here is no mention of the Spirit’s coming with the Father and the Son, because the Son dwelleth in us by the Spirit. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them,.... He that has not merely the external revelation of them in the Bible; but has them written on his heart, by the finger of the Spirit of God, and keeps them under the influence of grace and strength received from him: <p>he it is that loveth me: others may talk of loving Christ, but this is the man that truly does love him; for his observance of Christ's commands is a proof and evidence that he loves him not in word only, but in deed and in truth: and to encourage souls to love and obedience, Christ adds, <p>he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father; not that love to is the cause, condition, or motive of the Father's love to his people; nor does his love to them begin when they begin to love Christ; but this expression denotes some further and greater manifestation of the Father's love to such persons, and shows how grateful to the Father are love and obedience to the Son: <p>and I will love him; which must be understood in the same manner; Christ does not begin to love his people when they begin to love, and obey him; their love and obedience to him, spring from his love to them; which love of his towards them was from everlasting: but this phrase signs a clearer discovery of his love to them, which passeth knowledge; and some fresh mark and token of his affection for them; and which is explained in the next clause: <p>and will manifest myself to him; not in a visible way, or in a corporeal form, as he did to his disciples after his resurrection; but in a spiritual manner, as when he makes himself known to his people in ordinances, and favours them with communion with him, and they see his beauty, his fulness, his grace and righteousness, his power, and his glory. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> manifest myself to him.</span><p>(k) I will show myself to him, and be known by him, as if he saw me with his eyes: but this showing of himself is not bodily, but spiritual, yet so plain that no other showing could be more evident.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-21.htm" title="He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.">John 14:21</a>. The conditions on which depended the manifestation of the departed Christ are then exhibited, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἔχων</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐμαυτόν</span>. The love to which Christ promises a manifestation of Himself is not an idle sentiment or shallow fancy, but a principle prompting obedience, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἔχων τὰς ἐντολάς μου</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-7.htm" title="Brothers, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you have heard from the beginning.">1 John 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-21.htm" title="And this commandment have we from him, That he who loves God love his brother also.">1 John 4:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-5.htm" title="And now I beseech you, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to you, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.">2 John 1:5</a>; it means more than “hearing,” and is yet not equivalent to <span class="greekheb">τηρῶν</span>; it seems to point to the permanent possession of the commandments in consciousness. This finds its appropriate expression in <span class="greekheb">τηρῶν αὐτάς</span>—“keeping them,” observing them in the life. This is the expression and proof of love, and this love finds its response and reward in the love of the Father and of the Son, and in the manifestation of the Son to the individual. The appropriateness of introducing the Father and His love appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-24.htm" title="He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.">John 14:24</a>. The love of Christ is that which prompts the manifestation. <span class="greekheb">ἐμφανίσω</span>, the word is used by Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-13.htm" title="Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found grace in your sight, show me now your way, that I may know you, that I may find grace in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people.">Exodus 33:13</a>. Reynolds says: “This remarkable word implies that the scene or place of the higher manifestation will be in (<span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>) the consciousness of the soul”. The word however is currently used for outward manifestation; although here the manifestation alluded to is inward. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Judas’ words. The nature of the manifestation has already been explained, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm" title="Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.">John 14:19</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">hath my commandments, and keepeth them</span>] Bears them in his mind and observes them in his life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he it is</span>] With great emphasis; he and no one else.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">will manifest myself to him</span>] Once more willing obedience is set forth as the road to spiritual enlightenment (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>).

God the Father loves those who love the Son, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> love the object of his own superlative affection.

This remarkable word, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, implies that the scene and place of the higher manifestation will be "<span class="accented">in"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>) the consciousness of the soul.
