The Father's will is, that not one of those who were given to the Son, should be rejected or lost by him. No one will come, till Divine grace has subdued, and in part changed his heart; therefore no one who comes will ever be cast out. The gospel finds none willing to be saved in the humbling, holy manner, made known therein; but God draws with his word and the Holy Ghost; and man's duty is to hear and learn; that is to say, to receive the grace offered, and consent to the promise. None had seen the Father but his beloved Son; and the Jews must expect to be taught by his inward power upon their minds, and by his word, and the ministers whom he sent among them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the prophets - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>.

In the book of the prophets, as the Ethiopic version renders it: the Jews divided the books of the Old Testament into three parts, the Law, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa; now in that division which was called the Prophets, are the following words: or in one of the prophets, namely, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>; so the Syriac version reads, "in the prophet"; though some think reference is had to more prophets, and more passages than one, as besides the above mentioned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>; <p>and they shall be all taught of God; by his Spirit to know themselves, and Jesus Christ; that is, all that are ordained to eternal life; all that are given to Christ, and are chosen in him; all the children of Zion, and who are the children of God; these are all, sooner or later, in a special manner, taught of God: and which does not intend mere external instructions, and objective teachings by the ministry of the word, for many are so taught, who never come to Christ; but special teachings, such as are attended with the energy of divine grace, and the power of the Spirit of God, who guides into all truth, savingly and spiritually: for this is to be understood of their being taught in the Gospel of Christ, and not in the law, as the Targum paraphrases it, <p>"all thy children shall learn in the law of the Lord.'' <p>And that this prophecy refers to Gospel times, is clear from the citation and application of the first verse of it, to the church in the times of the apostles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-27.htm">Galatians 4:27</a>. The Jews themselves acknowledge the prophecy belongs to the times of the Messiah, to which they expressly apply (u) the words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>, "thy Maker is thy husband", &amp;c. And one of their modern commentators allows (w), that this very passage, "all thy children shall be taught of God", refers,  "to the time to come"; that is, to the times of the Messiah: in this citation, those words, "thy children", are left out, to show that the words are not to be restrained to the people of the Jews, as they might seem by that clause, and to whom the Jews would limit them: for so they say (x), <p>"they are truly taught of God from whom prophecy comes, which does not to all the world, but to Israel only, of whom it is written, "and all thy children are taught of God".'' <p>But our Lord, by these words, instructs us, and would have us observe, that all that the Father hath given him, whether Jews or Gentiles, of whom he had been speaking in the preceding verses, should be taught of God; and so taught, as to be drawn and brought to him, and believe in him, and have everlasting life: wherefore he infers from hence, that every man, whether a Jew or a Gentile, that is taught of God, will come to him in a spiritual way, and trust in him for eternal life and happiness, as follows: <p>every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me; everyone that has heard the voice of the Father's love, grace, and mercy in the Gospel, and has learned of him the way of peace, life, and salvation by Christ, under the influence of his grace, comes unto Christ; being encouraged by the declarations and promises of grace he has heard and learned, and ventures his soul on Christ, and commits it to him; trusting and relying on his person, blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, for justification, pardon, atonement, acceptance with God, and eternal life. <p>(u) Shemot Rabba, sect. 15. fol. 102. 4.

The divine life which was manifested in Christ upon earth was the personal life of His pre-existent state, as the prologue teaches, otherwise John had not given the original sense of the declaration of the Lord regarding Himself (to which conclusion Weizsäcker comes in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. D. Th</span>. 1862, p. 674), which, however, is inconceivable in so great and ever-recurring a leading point. It is the transcendent recollection in His temporal self-consciousness of that earlier divine condition, which makes itself known in such declarations (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you receive not our witness.">John 3:11</a>).

His certitude concerning the perfect revelation does not first begin with the baptism, but stretches back with its roots into His pre-human existence. See, against Weizsäcker, Beyschlag also, p. 79 ff., who, however (comp. p. 97 f.), in referring it to the sinless birth, and further to the pre-existent state of Jesus, <span class="ital">as the very image of God</span>, is not just to the Johannean view in the prologue, and in the first epistle, as well as here, and in the analogous testimonies of Jesus regarding Himself. See on ver. 62. Beyschlag renders: “<span class="ital">because</span> He is of God, He has seen God <span class="ital">in His historical existence</span>.” The far-fetched thought is here brought in, that only the pure in heart can see God.

In confirmation of His assertion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-44.htm" title="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:44</a>, Jesus, as is His wont, cites Scripture: <span class="greekheb">ἔστι γεγραμμένον ἐν τοῖς προφήταις</span>, that is, it is written in that part of Scripture known as “the Prophets”. The passage cited is <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-13.htm" title="And all your children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of your children.">Isaiah 54:13</a>, where, in describing Messianic times, the prophet says, “Thy children shall all be taught of God,” <span class="greekheb">ἔσονται πάντες διδακτοὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, and what this being taught of God means He more fully explains in the words <span class="greekheb">πᾶς οὖν</span> … <span class="greekheb">μαθὼν</span>, “every one who has heard from the Father and has learned comes to me”. Both the hearing and the learning refer to an inward spiritual process. The outward teaching of Scripture and of Christ Himself was enjoyed by all the people He was addressing; but they did not come to Him. It is therefore an inward and individual illumination by the special operation of God that enables men to come to Christ. Whether these verses teach “irresistible grace” may be doubted. That they teach the doctrine which Augustine asserted against Pelagius, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that power to use grace must itself be given by God, is undeniable. That is affirmed in the statement that no one can come to Christ unless the Father draw him. But whether it is also true that every one whom God teaches comes is not here stated; the <span class="greekheb">καὶ μαθὼν</span> introduces a doubtful element.

The quotation explains what is meant by the Father’s <span class="ital">drawing</span> men, viz., enlightening them. The ‘therefore’ in the second half of the verse is not genuine: ‘therefore’ is very common in the narrative portion of this Gospel, very rare in the discourses.

[LXX., 38.] 34, for the same thought in other words). Godet suggests that the former passage was in the <span class="accented">haphtora</span>, from the prophets - the lesson for the day. If the discourse was uttered in the synagogue of Capernaum, this is not impossible. At all events, the "and" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) which here follows suggests that the quotation is taken from Isaiah. And they shall all be taught of God; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. direct teaching by God is the prime requisite of any spiritual apprehension, even of the mysteries of Christ the Revealer. This solemn truth is affirmed by the entire history of Christ. The vision of his majesty, even contact with his ineffable love, the sight of his humiliation and of the shedding of his precious blood, did not, by any necessarily acting law of mind, induce faith. Divine teaching by the Spirit of the Father and Son is the preliminary (see notes on John 16:5-8, on the mission of the Comforter) to believing on Christ. "Taught of God" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), translated in Vulgate, <span class="accented">docibiles Dei</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>), means more than the reception of one lesson in the school of God, and suggests a prolonged experience and a rich communion between the Teacher and the taught. <span class="cmt_word">Every</span> <span class="cmt_word">one</span> (therefore)  [<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, referring to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 45<span class="accented">a</span>, and to the quotation, is not so much every human being, as the "all" of the Messianic kingdom - the "all" of God's "sons" and "<span class="accented">children</span> "] <span class="cmt_word">that hath heard</span>  <span class="cmt_word">from</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Father, and hath learned</span> (<span class="accented">of him</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>cometh unto me.</span> Hearing may end in heedlessness, even when the Lord God Almighty speaks with us. His revelations at great epochs, his inner voice at special moments in our religious history, may be disregarded. The voice of God may be heard, yet not obeyed; the voice of conscience and revelation and inspiration, the sacred monitions and warnings of the heart, may all be slighted. But every one that hath heard the Father, and has also accepted the lesson - has felt the Divine drawing; being willing to do the will of the Father, he knows of the doctrine, whether it be of God, and he comes to Christ. Later on, Christ said, "Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice." It is one thing to "hear," another to "learn," another to "come." These three stages still further illumine the "drawing" of the Father, and the method which the Father has adopted of so giving men to Christ that he may ultimately fold them in his arms and press them to his heart. Lest, however, the hearers of Jesus, then or now, should conclude that the kind of direct teaching of which the prophets spake, and which he endorsed, was of that immediate kind which himself enjoyed, and which alone justifies this language, he continued - <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Taught of God (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>The idea is thrown into a compound adjective, &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>. </body></html>
