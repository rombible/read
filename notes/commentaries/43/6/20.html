There may be perils and afflictions of this present time, where there is an interest in Christ. Clouds and darkness often surround the children of the light and of the day. They see Jesus walking on the sea. Even the approaches of comfort and deliverance often are so mistaken, as to become the occasions of fear. Nothing is more powerful to convince sinners than that word, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest; nothing more powerful to comfort saints than this, I am Jesus whom thou lovest. If we have received Christ Jesus the Lord, though the night be dark, and the wind high, yet we may comfort ourselves, we shall be at the shore before long.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this miracle of walking on the sea explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22-33</a>.

Hearing this, <span class="greekheb">ἤθελον οὖν λαβεῖν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ πλοῖον</span>, by which Lücke, Holtzmann, Weiss, Thayer, and others suppose it is meant, that they merely wished to take Him into the boat, but did not actually do so. The imperfect tense favours this sense; and so do the expressions <span class="greekheb">ἤθελον πιάσαι αὐτόν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-44.htm" title="And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.">John 7:44</a>; and <span class="greekheb">ἤθελον αὐτὸν ἐρωτᾷν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-19.htm" title="Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and you shall not see me: and again, a little while, and you shall see me?">John 16:19</a>; whereas two of the passages cited against this meaning by Alford are in the aorist, a tense which denotes accomplished purpose. On the other hand, the imperfect may here be used to express a continuous state of feeling, and accordingly the A.V[56], following the Geneva Bible, against Wiclif and Tindale, rendered “they willingly received Him”. So Grotius “non quod non receperint, sed quod cupide admodum”. So, too, Sanday: “The stress is really on the willingness of the disciples, ‘Before they shrank back through fear, but now they were glad to receive Him’ ”. And this seems right. The R.V[57] has “they were willing therefore to receive Him into the boat”. The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> with which the next clause is introduced is slightly against the supposition that Jesus was not actually taken into the boat (but see Weiss <span class="ital">in loc.</span>); and the Synoptic account represents Jesus as getting into the boat with Peter. The immediate arrival at the shore was evidently a surprise to those on board. Sanday thinks that the Apostle was so occupied with his devout conclusions that he did not notice the motion of the boat.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[56] Authorised Version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[57] Revised Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">It is I</span>] Literally, <span class="ital">I am</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-5.htm" title="They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth.

The Church has ever since regarded them as veritably  sacramental. In the darkest hour of men and Churches, in the throes of persecution in the furnace of temptation, on a million death-beds, the same voice has been heard. tits Divine Personality, his infinite power and perfect sympathy, the conviction of his specialized regard and veritable nearness (as we count nearness), have scattered doubt and fear. </body></html>
