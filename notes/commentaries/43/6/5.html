(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-8.htm" title="Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.">John 14:8</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) The impression of the immediate antecedents of the miracle is different from, but not opposed to, that of the other narratives. They all represent the request coming from the disciples as the first step. St. John does not say it was not so They represent what took place as seen from the outer circle; he, from the point of view of those near to his Master. We may think of the group of disciples seated round Him, and of the first-called Andrew and Peter, James and John, and Philip (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>) as closer to Him than the others, who come and speak to Him about the multitudes. While the wants of all are present, the wants of the individuals are not absent. There is something in the character of Philip which this occasion may test. To him is the question spoken which may yet have been an answer to their remark. For “saw a great company come,” read <span class= "ital">saw that a great multitude cometh.</span> It is the vivid present of the crowd coming. “Whence shall we buy bread . . .?” or rather, <span class= "ital">Whence are we to buy bread?</span> with the best MSS.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-5.htm" title="When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come to him, he said to Philip, From where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?...">John 6:5-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">When Jesus lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come to him </span>— That is, gathered round him; <span class="ital">he saith unto Philip </span>— Namely, after he had first taught the people many things, as we learn from the other evangelists, and had <span class="ital">healed them, that had need of healing, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-34.htm" title="And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.">Mark 6:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-11.htm" title="And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he received them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that had need of healing.">Luke 9:11</a>; <span class="ital">Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? </span>— He addressed himself to Philip particularly, because he, being a native of Bethsaida, was best acquainted with that country. <span class="ital">This he said to prove him </span>— To try what idea he had conceived of his divine power, and to give him an opportunity of observing what followed more attentively. <span class="ital">Philip answered, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient, </span>&c. — The Roman denarius, or penny, being equal to about seven pence half- penny of English money, two hundred of them were equal to about six pounds five shillings sterling, as much, probably, as their whole stock amounted to. <span class="ital">One of his disciples saith </span>— In answer to Jesus’s inquiring how many loaves they had, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-38.htm" title="He said to them, How many loaves have you? go and see.

The Pharisees despised them as not knowing the law; but they knew most of Him who is the end of the law.

See the differing circumstances considered in our annotations on those chapters. The other evangelists observe, that Christ had first been preaching to them, until it was near night; and then bring in the disciples first moving him (because they had eaten nothing) to send them away to provide themselves food. This evangelist begins with some words Christ should speak to Philip. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When Jesus then lift up his eyes,.... Being before engaged in close conversation with his disciples, and looking wistly and intently on them, whilst he was discoursing with them: <p>and saw a great company come unto him; who came on foot, over the bridge at Chammath, from Capernaum, and other cities of Galilee: <p>he saith unto Philip; he directed his discourse to him particularly, because he was of Bethsaida, near to which place Christ now was, and therefore might be best able to answer the following question: <p>whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? This, according to the other evangelists, must be said after Christ came from the mountain, and the people were come to him, and he had received them kindly, and had instructed them about the kingdom of God, and had healed the diseased among them, and expressed great compassion for them; and after the disciples had desired him to dismiss them, that they might go to the adjacent towns, and provide food for themselves; which Christ would not admit of and declared it unnecessary, and then put this question, with the following view. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{1}</span> When Jesus then lifted up <i>his</i> eyes, and saw a great company come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</span><p>(1) They that follow Christ sometimes hunger, but they are never without help.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-5.htm" title="When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come to him, he said to Philip, From where shall we buy bread, that these may eat?...">John 6:5-6</a>.

The fact that Jesus thus takes the <span class="ital">initiative</span> (as <span class="ital">host</span>, Ewald thinks, but this is not enough), and takes action without the prompting of any expressed need, however real, is not to be explained merely on the supposition that this is an abridgment (Lücke, Neander, Hengstenberg) of the synoptical account (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-15.htm" title="And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.">Matthew 14:15</a>); it is a <span class="ital">discrepancy</span>, which, however, does not destroy the fact that John was an eye-witness. It is purely arbitrary on Baur’s part to assume the design to be that of directing attention more directly to the spiritual purpose of the miracle, or, with Hilgenfeld, to regard all here as <span class="ital">composed</span> out of synoptical materials to prove the omnipotence of the Logos. The most simple and obvious course is to explain the representation given as flowing from the preponderating idea of the <span class="ital">Messiah’s autonomy</span>.[225] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-15.htm" title="And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.">Matthew 14:15</a>. It is an analogous case when Jesus <span class="ital">Himself gave occasion to</span> and introduced the miracle at Bethesda, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-6.htm" title="When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he said to him, Will you be made whole?">John 5:6</a>. It is a <span class="ital">supplement</span> to the narrative in the Synoptics, that Jesus discussed with <span class="ital">Philip</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>) the question of bread. Why with <span class="ital">him?</span> According to Bengel, because it fell to him to manage the <span class="ital">res alimentaria</span>, which is improbable, for <span class="ital">Judas</span> was treasurer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-29.htm" title="For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.">John 13:29</a>. Judging from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-6.htm" title="And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.">John 6:6</a>, we might say it was because Philip had to be tested according to his intellectual idiosyncrasy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-8.htm" title="Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.">John 14:8</a> ff.), and convinced of his <span class="ital">inability to advise.</span> The <span class="greekheb">πειράζειν</span> does not signify the trial of <span class="ital">faith</span> (so usually, even Hengstenberg), but, as <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς γὰρ ᾔδει</span> shows, was a <span class="ital">test whether he could here suggest any expedient;</span> and the <span class="ital">answer</span> of the disciple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-7.htm" title="Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.">John 6:7</a>) conveys only the impression that he knew of <span class="ital">none</span>. <span class="ital">This</span> consciousness, howzever, was intended also to prepare the disciple, who so closely resembled Thomas, and for whom the question, therefore, had an <span class="ital">educative</span> purpose, the more readily to feel, by the new and coming miracle, how the power of faith in the divine agency of his Lord transcended all calculations of the intellect. This was too important a matter for Jesus with respect to that disciple, to allow us to suppose that <span class="greekheb">πειράζων αὐτόν</span> is a mere notion of John’s own, which had its origin among the transfiguring recollections of a later time (Ewald). <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΗἼΔΕΙ ΤῶΝ ΜΑΘΗΤῶΝ ΤΟῪς ΜΆΛΙΣΤΑ ΔΕΟΜΈΝΟΥς ΠΛΕΊΟΝΟς ΔΙΔΑΣΚΑΛΊΑς</span></span></span>, Theodore of Mopsuestia; in which there is nothing to suggest our attributing to Philip a “<span class="ital">simplicité naïve</span>,” Godet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span>] <span class="ital">Himself</span>, without having any need to resort to the advice of another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[225] Amid such minor circumstances, the <span class="ital">idea</span> might certainly supplant the more exact <span class="ital">historical</span> recollection even in a John. We have no right, however, on that account, to compare Jesus, according to John’s representation, to a housewife, who, when she sees the guests coming in the distance, thinks in the first place of what she can set before them, as Hase (<span class="ital">Tübing.

Seeing the crowd approaching, He initiates the idea of giving them a meal. The synoptic account is different.—<span class="greekheb">λέγει πρὸς τὸν φίλιππον</span>. Why to Philip? The question was put to Philip not because he happened at the moment to be nearest to Jesus (Alford); nor, as Bengel suggests, because he had charge of the commissariat, “fortasse Philippus rem alimentariam curabat inter discipulos”; nor “because he knew the country best”; nor only, as Euthymius says, <span class="greekheb">ἵνα τὴν ἀπορίαν ὁμολογήσας</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀκριβέστερον καταμάθη τοῦ μέλλοντος γενέσθαι θαύματος τὸ μέγεθος</span>; but Cyril is right who finds the explanation in the character of Philip and in the word <span class="greekheb">πειράζων</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-6.htm" title="And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.">John 6:6</a> [<span class="greekheb">γυμνάζων εἰς πίστιν τὸν μαθήτην</span>].

Because he was nearest to Him; or because his forward spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-8.htm" title="Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.">John 14:8</a>) needed to be convinced of its own helplessness; or because, as living on the lake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-44.htm" title="Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.">John 1:44</a>) he would know the neighbourhood. Any or all of these suggestions may be correct. As Judas kept the bag it is not likely that Philip commonly provided food for the party. A more important question remains: “we notice that the impulse to the performance of the miracle comes in the Synoptists from the disciples; in S. John, solely from our Lord Himself.” This is difference, but not contradiction: S. John’s narrative does not preclude the possibility of the disciples having spontaneously applied to Christ for help either before or after this conversation with Philip. “For the rest the superiority in distinctness and precision is all on the side of S. John. He knows to whom the question was put; he knows exactly what Philip answered; and again the remark of Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother … Some memories are essentially pictorial; and the Apostle’s appears to have been one of these. It is wonderful with what precision every stroke is thrown in. Most minds would have become confused in reproducing events which had occurred so long ago; but there is no confusion here.

The first approach of the multitude was the occasion of a suggestion which Jesus made to Philip. The other evangelists record the reopening of the conversation on the same theme, stimulated by the question already put to Philip in the forenoon, and on this occasion originated by the disciples. The company arrived by the head of the lake (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-33.htm">Mark 6:33</a>, "They ran afoot out of all the cities"); and the first compassionate thought is attributed by John to the Lord himself: <span class="cmt_word">Whence are we to</span> <span class="cmt_word">buy</span> (bread) <span class="cmt_word">loaves, that these multitudes may eat?</span> This very question shows the intimate relations between our Lord and his disciples - the touch of nature. The identification of his interests with theirs is in the "we." Why should Philip be selected for the questioning or suggestion? Luthardt argues that it was a part of the needed education of that apostle that he should have been submitted to the searching anxiety.
