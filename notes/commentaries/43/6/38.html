He has spoken of the Father’s gift and of human action. He now once more identifies His own will with that of the Father, and yet states the fact of His possessing an independent will. It cannot be that He should cast out any one who comes. He knows, indeed, with the knowledge of human nature, how hard it is for men to read the spiritual through the sensuous, and what are the hindrances in the way of every seeker of truth. Added to this, He knows, with a divine knowledge, what is the infinite love of the Father, and He has Himself come down from heaven to fulfil heaven’s will in love to man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-38.htm" title="For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me....">John 6:38-40</a></span>. <span class="ital">For I came down from heaven — </span>Into this lower world; <span class="ital">not to do mine own will </span>— Or to seek any separate interest of my own; <span class="ital">but the will of him that sent me </span>— Who is loving to every man, and willeth not the death of a sinner. <span class="ital">And this is the Father’s will </span>— This he revealeth to be his will; <span class="ital">that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing </span>— It is the will of my Father that every thing necessary be done, both for the conversion of sinners and for the preservation of those in the paths of righteousness who are already converted. He even willeth all men to be saved, yea, eternally saved; and in order thereto, to <span class="ital">come to the knowledge of the truth, </span>and to persevere therein. But he willeth these things conditionally, and not absolutely: men through his grace must repent, and bring forth fruit worthy of repentance: they must believe in Christ, and in the truths and promises of his gospel, with a faith that worketh by love: they must resist the devil, steadfast in the faith; overcome the world, and crucify the flesh: they must <span class="ital">endure unto the end, </span>believing, loving, and obeying; must be <span class="ital">faithful unto death, </span>and then they shall receive <span class="ital">the crown of life. And this is </span>likewise <span class="ital">the will of him that sent me </span>— This also he wills conditionally; <span class="ital">that every one which seeth the Son </span>— Seeth the character and mission of the Son in the miracles which he works, and in the other evidences wherewith his mission is attended: as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-36.htm" title="But I said to you, That you also have seen me, and believe not.">John 6:36</a>; or who <span class="ital">recognises </span>the Son, <span class="ital">views him with an attentive mind; </span>as <span class="greekheb">θεωραω </span>seems evidently to imply; that <span class="ital">sees </span>him so as to <span class="ital">know </span>him; and in consequence of that knowledge, cordially <span class="ital">believeth on him </span>— Receiving him by faith, and trusting in him as an all-sufficient Saviour; <span class="ital">may have everlasting life </span>— It is the fixed determination of the Father, to bestow everlasting life on all who persevere in this faith; and therefore, in execution of my Father’s will; <span class="ital">I will raise </span>all such <span class="ital">up at the last day </span>— I will make them completely happy, both in soul and body, in the enjoyment of a glorious immortality: nor are there any purposes or decrees of God inconsistent with this. Thus did Jesus place the character of the Messiah in a light very different from that in which his hearers had been accustomed to view it; and taught them, that instead of temporal blessings, which they expected from him, they were to receive none but such as were spiritual.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:36-46 The discovery of their guilt, danger, and remedy, by the teaching of the Holy Spirit, makes men willing and glad to come, and to give up every thing which hinders applying to him for salvation. The Father's will is, that not one of those who were given to the Son, should be rejected or lost by him. No one will come, till Divine grace has subdued, and in part changed his heart; therefore no one who comes will ever be cast out. The gospel finds none willing to be saved in the humbling, holy manner, made known therein; but God draws with his word and the Holy Ghost; and man's duty is to hear and learn; that is to say, to receive the grace offered, and consent to the promise. None had seen the Father but his beloved Son; and the Jews must expect to be taught by his inward power upon their minds, and by his word, and the ministers whom he sent among them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I came down ... - This verse shows that he came for a specific purpose, which he states in the next verse, and means that, as he came to do his Father's will, he would be faithful to the trust.

The Jew (m) objects to this, and says, <p>"if this respects the descent of the soul, the soul of every man descended from thence; but if it respects the body, the rest of the evangelists contradict his words, particularly Luke, when he says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a> that his mother brought him forth at Bethlehem.'' <p>But this descent regards neither his soul nor body, but his divine person, which always was in heaven, and not any local descent of that; but, as before observed, an assumption of human nature, which he took of the virgin on earth; and so there is no contradiction between the evangelists; nor is descent from heaven unsuitable to Christ as a divine person, since it is ascribed to God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>; and if God may be said to go down from heaven by some display of his power, and intimation of his presence, Christ may be said to descend from heaven by that marvellous work of his, taking upon him our nature, and walking up and down on earth in the form of a servant; and which was done with this view, as he says, <p>not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me; that is, not to do his own will, as separate from his Father's, and much less as contrary to it; otherwise he did come to do his own will, which, as God, was the same with his Father's, he being one with him in nature, and so in power and will; and though his will, as man, was distinct from his Father's, yet not repugnant, but resigned unto it: and this will he came to do, was to preach the Gospel, fulfil the law, work miracles, and obtain the eternal redemption and salvation of his people. What the above Jewish writer (n) objects to this part of the text is of very little moment: whose words are; <p>"moreover, what he says, "not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me", shows, that he that sent, is not one and the same with him that is sent, seeing the will of him that is sent, is not as the will of him that sends.'' <p>It is readily granted that they are not one and the same person; they are two distinct persons, which sending, and being sent, do clearly show; but then they are one in nature, though distinct in person, and they agree in will and work. Christ came not to do any will of his own different from that of his Father's; nor do these words imply a difference of wills in them, much less a contrariety in them, but rather the sameness of them. <p>(m) R.

Everywhere Jesus forestalls the idea that He is speaking for Himself, and is uttering merely human judgments, or is in any way regulated in His action by what is arbitrary: it is the Supreme Will He represents. And this will requires Him to protect and provide for all that is committed to Him. <span class="greekheb">ἵνα πᾶν ὃ δέδωκέ μοι</span>, on this nominative absolute, see Lücke or Raphel, who justify it by many instances. The positive and negative aspects of the Redeemer’s work, and the permanence of its results, are indicated.

Four times in this discourse Christ declares that He is come down from heaven; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-38.htm" title="For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.">John 6:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-50.htm" title="This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die....">John 6:50-51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-58.htm" title="This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eats of this bread shall live for ever.">John 6:58</a>. The drift of these three verses (38–40) is;—How could I cast them out, seeing that I am come to do my Father’s will, and He wills that they should be received?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-38.htm" title="For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.">John 6:38</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καταβέβηκα</span>, <span class="ital">I came down</span>) This speech in many things flows from His personal union with the Father. For <span class="ital">His descent from heaven</span> refers to the nature which He had, prior to His birth from Mary according to the <span class="ital">flesh</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because I came down from heaven</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>), <span class="cmt_word">not that I might do my own will, but the will of him that sent me</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19, 30</a>, notes). The practical, ethical force of this statement is to shape and defend the previous assurance. Christ's gracious reception and benediction is in willing harmony with, and not in opposition to, the Father's heart. There is no schism between the Father and Son. A separate will in and of itself assigned to the Son is not inconceivable, nay, it is imperatively necessary to posit, or we should lose all distinctions whatever between the Father and Son, between God and Christ. But the very separateness of the wills gives the greater significance to their moral oneness. "Not my will, but thine be done," "Not as I will, but as thou wilt," involve submission, voluntary surrender, to the Father's will; but here the Lord insists on absolute harmony and free cooperation. The bare idea of the Incarnation suggests  the conditions of freedom which might conceivably issue in divarication of interest and aim. Christ declares that the Divine commission of his humanity is the spontaneous and free, but perfect, coincidence of his will with the Father's. Christ's embodiment of the Father's will, and coordination with it, make all his attractiveness to the human soul. His healing, feeding, and satisfying powers become a revelation of the Father's heart. If he will not cast out the coming ones, it is because he came down out of heaven to fulfil the Father's will (see further, vers. 44, 45), to explain the world wide hunger, to meet and execute the will of the Father. The frequent assertions by our Lord in this discourse (and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>) of his descent from heaven as One charged with a full knowledge of the Divine will, implies that the Lord was conscious of pre-existence in the very bosom of God. This was language which, with more of the same import, led St. John to the overwhelming conclusion that the Jesus whom he knew in the flesh was the Only Begotten of the Father - was the Logos made flesh. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>From heaven (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>But the best texts read &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;, from, instead of &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;, out of, the idea being rather that of departure (I came down) than of origin.
