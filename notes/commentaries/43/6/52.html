Observe, reader, the effects of this discourse of Christ: the Jews are tried here; the disciples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-60.htm" title="Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?">John 6:60</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-66.htm" title="From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him.">John 6:66</a>; the apostles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-67.htm" title="Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will you also go away?">John 6:67</a>. <span class="ital">Then Jesus </span>— Proceeding in the same figurative language he had used before, and without condescending to make any further explication; <span class="ital">said unto them, Verily, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, &c., ye have no life in you </span>— As if he had said, However you may censure my doctrine as unintelligible and absurd, yet nothing can be more certain than it, or more important to you. For except you be entirely united to me by a firm and lively faith in the truth and importance of my doctrine, and a cordial dependance, for acceptance with God, on the merit of the sacrifice which I shall offer for the sins of the world, thereby deriving spiritual strength and nourishment from me, through the influences of my Spirit, in the use of those means of grace which I shall institute, you can have no spiritual life in you here, nor attain eternal life hereafter. The reader will easily observe, that by <span class="ital">eating his flesh and drinking his blood, </span>our Lord did not mean any corporeal action whatever, but men’s receiving in faith, and with gratitude, those blessings, to confer which he assumed the human nature. The expression therefore implies a true and lively faith in “the revelation he came to make, concerning the merciful counsels of God for the salvation of sinners; or, as he himself expresses it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a>, <span class="ital">The word that he spake to them, </span>especially concerning his incarnation, and his dying to make atonement for sin. Which articles of the Christian faith, being particularly understood here, give propriety to the metaphors of <span class="ital">eating Christ’s flesh and drinking his blood, </span>by which the whole of that faith is denominated. The reason is, of all the discoveries made by Christ, those concerning his incarnation, and the nature and ends of his death, received and meditated upon with a lively faith, afford sovereign and salutary nourishment unto the minds of sinners. They are as effectual for sustaining the spiritual life in the soul, as flesh, fitly prepared, is for nourishing the animal life in the body.” The sacrament of the eucharist was plainly intended to affect our minds with a sense of these important truths, and our Lord might probably think of that intended institution while he spoke: but as this was a future thing, and utterly unknown to his hearers, it would be very unwarrantable to interpret this text as chiefly referring to that ordinance.

These are called the flesh and blood of Christ, because they are purchased by the breaking his body, and the shedding of his blood. Also, because they are meat and drink to our souls. Eating this flesh and drinking this blood mean believing in Christ. We partake of Christ and his benefits by faith. The soul that rightly knows its state and wants, finds whatever can calm the conscience, and promote true holiness, in the redeemer, God manifest in the flesh. Meditating upon the cross of Christ gives life to our repentance, love, and gratitude. We live by him, as our bodies live by our food. We live by him, as the members by the head, the branches by the root: because he lives we shall live also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The bread that I will give is by flesh - That is, his body would be offered as a sacrifice for sin, agreeably to his declaration when he instituted the Supper: "This is my body which is broken for you," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>.<p>Life of the world - That sinners might, by his atoning sacrifice, be recovered from spiritual death, and be brought to eternal life.

In this verse Jesus introduces the subject of his death and atonement. It may be remarked that in the language which he used the transition from bread to his flesh would appear more easy than it does in our language.

Instead now of explaining the <span class="ital">how</span> of their question, Jesus sets before them the absolute <span class="ital">necessity</span> of their partaking, and in still more extreme terms lays down the requirement, which seemed so paradoxical to them; for He nows adds the <span class="ital">drinking of His blood</span>, in order thus to bring more prominently into view the reference to His <span class="ital">death</span>, and its life-giving power to be experienced by believing appropriation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ υἱοῦ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>.] This prophetic and Messianic self-designation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-51.htm" title="And he said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.">John 1:51</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven....">John 3:13-14</a>), which could now less easily escape the notice of His hearers than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-27.htm" title="Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for that meat which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give to you: for him has God the Father sealed.">John 6:27</a>, serves as a still more solemn expression in place of <span class="greekheb">μου</span>, without, however, affecting the meaning of the eating and drinking.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔχετε ζωὴν ἐν ἑαυτ</span>.] “<span class="ital">ye have not life in yourselves</span>,” “<span class="ital">life</span> is foreign to and remote from your own inner nature,”—<span class="ital">death</span> is the power that ye have in you, spiritual and eternal death; life must first, by that eating and drinking, be inwardly united with your own selves.

They were not unanimous in their judgment. Some said one thing, and others said another. The "Jews" had not yet come to a unanimous opinion that this wonderful Being was talking sheer heresy or incomprehensible mystery. They knew his habit of metaphoric speech, and that underneath common imagery he was in the habit of conveying doctrines the full purport of which was not at once apparent. Some denounced him as uttering an intolerable riddle. Some saw, in a measure, through it, and hated the doctrine that was thereby conveyed. How could <span class="accented">he</span> be so essential to the life of the world? and how, said the pure materialist, "how can he give us his flesh to eat?" A question of great interest arises. He has already identified, in ver. 35, "coming to him," "reaching him" under the drawing of the Father, with the transcendent blessing of life eternal, of victory, over death, and resurrection. In ver. 40 "beholding" and "believing" are cognate or equivalent conditions of life and resurrection. In ver. 47, again, "believing," <span class="accented">per se</span>, is the essential and all-comprehensive condition. Now, has Christ added, in this verse, anything fresh to the fundamental ideas? Let it be pondered that he has already equated "believing" with eating a bread that endureth to everlasting life (vers. 27-29). He has declared himself to be the "Bread of life," and to be appropriated by "coming" and "believing." He has spoken of himself as "living Bread," which, coming for the life of the world from heaven itself, is offered as food. Now, what more than this has he said when he declared that he will offer his "<span class="accented">flesh"</span> as heavenly food? The Jews undoubtedly show, by their mutual contest, that he had put some part of the previous oracle in a still more enigmatical, if not offensive, form. So far the imagery was not altogether beyond them. Here it takes on a form which excites angry controversy. If they understood him to mean "doctrine," "truth," "cause," even "office," as Head of a spiritual school - as one providing by his gracious will ample nutriment for all who would eat of the rich banquet of his words - they would, to some extent, follow him. The eating of the tree of life was a well known figure in Hebrew Scripture (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-17.htm">Proverbs 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-5.htm">Proverbs 9:5</a>); cf. the language of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>), the action of Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a>), and the imagery of Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>). In the "Midrash on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>," "eating and drinking" is said always to refer to the Law (Edersheim and Wunsche). But when he spoke of giving his "<span class="accented">flesh"</span> for the life of the world, he passed beyond the limits of their interpreting power. They did not see through his imagery; nor did Jesus exactly answer the angry query which they were putting one to another. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Strove (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>The murmuring (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-41.htm">John 6:41</a>) now breaks out into open contention among the Jews themselves. </body></html>
