Its true relation to Him is shown in the fact that those who ate it afterwards died; whereas He is the true spiritual food for the world, and those who feed upon Him shall not afterwards die. That was manna, special in time and circumstance; this is bread, the true sustenance for all times and all circumstances. That seemed to them to come from heaven, and this from earth; but this outer earth-born form of flesh contains the true life, in the only way in which humanity could receive it.

All the while they were in the wilderness, for the space of forty years, till they came to the borders of the land of Canaan; this was their only food on which they lived, during their travels through the wilderness. It is observable, that Christ says, not "our fathers", but "your fathers"; for though Christ, as concerning the flesh, came of these fathers, yet in every sense they were rather theirs than his; because regard may be had to such of them more especially who ate the manna as common food, and not as spiritual meat, as typical of the Messiah, as others did; and whom these, their offspring, did very much resemble. Though perhaps the reason of the use of this phrase may be, because the Jews themselves had used it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31</a>, and Christ takes it up from them. <p>And are dead. This food, though it supported them in life for a while, could not preserve them from a corporeal death, and still less from an eternal one: for some of them not only died the first, but the second death. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-49.htm" title="Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead....">John 6:49-50</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οἱ πατέρες</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] “regeruntur Judaeis verba ipsorum <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-31.htm" title="Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.">John 6:31</a>,” Bengel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπέθανον</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀποθάνῃ</span>] a diversity in the reference which is full of meaning: loss of <span class="ital">earthly</span> life, loss of <span class="ital">eternal</span> life, whose development, already begun in time (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-15.htm" title="That whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.">John 3:15</a>), the death of the body does not interrupt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-25.htm" title="Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believes in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:">John 11:25</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ ἄρτος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] of <span class="ital">this</span> nature is the bread which cometh down from heaven: <span class="ital">one</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὶς</span>) <span class="ital">must eat thereof</span>, and (in consequence of this eating) <span class="ital">not die</span>.

In other words: The manna which was given to your fathers to maintain them in physical, earthly life, could not assert its power against death, and maintain them continually in life. Your fathers died physically. The bread which comes down from heaven does not give physical life; it is not sent for that purpose, but the life which it is given to maintain, it maintains in continuance and precludes death. Taken in connection with the context, the words interpret themselves. Godet however says: “Jesus, both here and elsewhere, certainly denies even physical death in the case of the believer. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.">John 8:51</a>. That which properly constitutes death, in what we call by this name, is the total cessation of moral and physical existence. Now this fact does not take place in the case of the believer at the moment when his friends see him die.” This seems to misrepresent the fact of death for the sake of misrepresenting the present passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">49</span>. Christ answers them out of their own mouths. They had spoken of the manna as superior to the multiplied loaves and fishes; but the manna did not preserve men from death. The same word is used both in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-49.htm" title="Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.">John 6:49</a></span> and <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-50.htm" title="This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.">John 6:50</a></span>; therefore for ‘are dead’ it will be better to substitute <span class="bld">died</span>.

The Heaven-given manna by which Jehovah sustained the temporal life of the fathers in the wilderness did not convey the antidote to death. "The carcases [of these fathers] fell in the wilderness." He does not say, "perished out of God's sight forever," or were condemned, but that there was nothing in the eating of manna which arrested, or averted, or triumphed, over death; yet he added: <span class="cmt_word">This</span> (<span class="cmt_word">Bread</span> <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">life</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is the Bread which cometh down from heaven, in order that</span> <span class="cmt_word">any one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">may eat thereof, and may not</span> die. The eating of the Bread of life (the life-giving Bread), which I myself am, the thorough assimilation, the entire acceptance of me as God's Gift of life to the world, confers the very principle of life; and, though a partaker may seem to perish, he does <span class="accented">not die</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm">John 8:51-11:26</a>, notes) - he will not "taste of death," "he will never die." The life will be stronger than death; it will survive apparent extinction. Meyer says that here Christ reserves to ver. 51 the positive offer "of his own concrete Personality, and is exhibiting the true Bread, according to its real nature." Still he has said, "I am the life-giving Bread," and is undoubtedly preparing for the following announcement, which adds a new and startling thought, calculated to sustain the former one. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Are dead (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The aorist points, not to their present condition but to the historical fact; they died.
