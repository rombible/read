All tell of the five loaves and two fishes. John knows that they are barley loaves—the ordinary black bread of the Galilean peasant; and that the loaves and fishes are not the property of the disciples, but of a lad or slave who has followed the crowd, in the hope, it may be, of finding a purchaser for them.<p>The word for “lad” is a diminutive occurring only here (not in the best text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-16.htm" title="But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,">Matthew 11:16</a>), and in many MSS. is accompanied by “one.” The word may mean a servant, but it more probably means a child. One lad! What could he bear for so many?<p><span class= "bld">Two small fishes.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">two fishes.</span> This word, too, is rightly regarded as a diminutive, but it is not a diminutive of “fish.” The original root means <span class= "ital">to boil;</span> thus the substantive is used, as in Homer, of boiled meat, and then of anything eaten as a relish with bread, and specially of fish. This diminutive is used in the New Testament only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-11.htm" title="And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.">John 6:11</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/21-9.htm" title="As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.">John 21:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-13.htm" title="Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.">John 21:13</a>. A comparison of the passages will make it clear that St. John means by the word the ordinary relish of fish, which formed, with bread, the staple food of the people.<p>The whole force of Andrew’s remark, with its diminutive words, rests upon the smallness of their power to help, while Philip had dwelt on the greatness of the need.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-14 John relates the miracle of feeding the multitude, for its reference to the following discourse. Observe the effect this miracle had upon the people. Even the common Jews expected the Messiah to come into the world, and to be a great Prophet. The Pharisees despised them as not knowing the law; but they knew most of Him who is the end of the law.

Who either belonged to Christ and his disciples, and was employed to carry their provisions for them; which, if so, shows how meanly Christ and his disciples lived; or he belonged to some in the multitude; or rather he came here to sell what he had got: <p>which hath five barley loaves. The land of Canaan was a land of barley, as well as wheat, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>; this sort of grain grew there in plenty, and was in much use; the Jews had a barley harvest, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/1-22.htm">Ruth 1:22</a>, which was at the time of the passover; for on the second day after the passover, the sheaf of the first fruits was waved before the Lord, which was of barley; hence the Targumist on the place just cited, paraphrases it thus; <p>"they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of the passover, and on the day the children of Israel began to reap the sheaf of the wave offering, which was of barley.'' <p>And it was now about the time of the passover, as appears from <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-4.htm">John 6:4</a>, and had it been quite the time, and the barley sheaf had been waved, it might have been thought that these loaves were made of the new barley; but though barley was in use for bread among the Jews, as is evident, from the mention that is made of barley loaves and cakes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42</a>; yet it was bread of the coarsest sort, and what the meaner sort of people ate; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>. Yea, barley was used for food for horses and dromedaries, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-28.htm">1 Kings 4:28</a>; and since therefore these loaves were, if not designed for the use of Christ and his twelve apostles, yet for some of his followers, and which they all ate of; it is an instance of the meanness and poverty of them: but however, they had better bread than this, even the bread of life, which is afterwards largely treated of in this chapter, which some of them at least ate of; and as our countryman Mr. Dod used to say, <p>"brown bread and the Gospel are good fare:'' <p>and it may be further observed, that the number of these loaves were but few; there were but "five" of them, for "five thousand" persons; and these do not seem to be very large ones, since one lad was able to carry them; and indeed, these loaves were no other than cakes, in which form they used to be made: <p>and two small fishes; there were but "two", and these "small"; it is amazing, that five thousand persons should everyone have something of them, and enough: these fishes seem to be what the Jews (c) call   and which the gloss interprets "small fishes": and by the word which is used of them, they seem to be salted, or pickled fishes, and such it is very probable these were; Nonnus calls them,  , "fishes which were broiled", or perhaps dried in the sun; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-42.htm">Luke 24:42</a>. <p>But what are they among so many? everyone cannot possibly have a taste, much less any refreshment, still less a meal. <p>(c) T.

The word occurs in the New Testament only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-13.htm">John 6:13</a>. An inferior sort of bread is indicated by the term.

Homer speaks of an onion as a relish (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) for drink ("Iliad," 11, 630). The term was applied to fish par excellence. Fish became among the Greeks a chief dainty to gourmands, so that Demosthenes describes a glutton and spendthrift as one who is extravagant in fish.<p>But what are they among so many?<p>Peculiar to John, though the idea is implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-13.htm">Luke 9:13</a>. </body></html>
