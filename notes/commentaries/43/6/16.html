There may be perils and afflictions of this present time, where there is an interest in Christ. Clouds and darkness often surround the children of the light and of the day. They see Jesus walking on the sea. Even the approaches of comfort and deliverance often are so mistaken, as to become the occasions of fear. Nothing is more powerful to convince sinners than that word, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest; nothing more powerful to comfort saints than this, I am Jesus whom thou lovest. If we have received Christ Jesus the Lord, though the night be dark, and the wind high, yet we may comfort ourselves, we shall be at the shore before long.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this miracle of walking on the sea explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22-33</a>.

After Jesus had reassured them by His call, <span class="ital">they wish to take Him into the ship, and straightway</span> (while entertaining this <span class="greekheb">ἐθέλειν</span>) <span class="ital">the ship is at the land, i.e</span>. by the wonder working power of Jesus, both with respect to the distance from the shore, which was still far off, and the fury of the sea, which had just been raging, but was now suddenly calmed. The idea that Jesus, to whom the disciples had stretched out their hands, had just <span class="ital">come on board</span> the ship, introduces a foreign element (against Luthardt and Godet), for the sake of bringing the account into harmony with Matthew and Mark. The discrepancy with Matthew and Mark, according to whom Christ was actually received into the ship, must not be explained away, especially as in John a more wonderful point, peculiar to his account, is introduced by the <span class="greekheb">καὶ εὐθέως</span>, etc., which makes the actual reception <span class="ital">superfluous</span> (Hengstenberg, following Bengel, regards it as implied). An unhappy attempt at harmonizing renders it, “<span class="ital">they</span> <span class="ital">willingly received Him”</span> (Beza, Grotius, Kuinoel, Ammon, etc.; see, on the contrary, Winer, p. 436 [E. T. p. 586]; Buttmann, <span class="ital">N. T. Gk</span>. p. 321 [E. T. p. 375]), which cannot be supported by a supposed antithesis of previous unwillingness (Ebrard, Tholuck), but would be admissible only if the text represented the will <span class="ital">and</span> the deed as undoubtedly simultaneous. See the passages given in Sturz, <span class="ital">Lex. Xen.;</span> Ast, <span class="ital">Lex. Plat</span>. I. 596. John would in that case have written <span class="greekheb">ἐθέλοντες οὖν ἔλαβον</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰς ἣ ὑπῆγον</span>] to which they were intending by this journey to remove.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The miracle itself cannot be resolved into a natural occurrence,[228] nor be regarded as a story invented to serve Docetic views (Hilgenfeld); see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/14-24.htm" title="But the ship was now in the middle of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary....">Matthew 14:24-25</a>. The latter opinion appears most erroneous, especially in the case of John,[229] not only generally because his Gospel, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a> onwards to its close, excludes all Docetism, but also because he only introduces, with all brevity, the narrative before us by way of transition to what follows, without taking pains to lay emphasis upon the miraculous, and without adding any remark or comment, and consequently without any special doctrinal purpose; and thus the attribution of the occurrence of any symbolical design, <span class="ital">e.g</span>. prophetically to shadow forth the meetings of the risen Lord with His disciples (Luthardt), or the restless sea of the world upon which Christ draws nigh to His people after long delay (Hengstenberg), is utterly remote from a true exegesis. Weizsäcker’s narrowing of the event, moreover,—abstracting the miraculous element in the development of the history,—into an intervention of the Lord to render help, does such violence to the text, and to the plain meaning of the evangelist, that the main substance of the narrative would be thus explained away. The design, however, which Baur propounds, viz. that the greedy importunity of the people might be set forth, only to experience the cold hand of denial, and to bring out the spiritual side of the miracle of the feeding, would not have required this miraculous voyage in order to its realization.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[228] Ewald probably comes to that conclusion, for he takes <span class="greekheb">θεωροῦσι</span>, ver. 19, to denote a <span class="ital">mere</span> vision (phantasmagoria?), and <span class="greekheb">ἐφοβήθησαν</span> to signify <span class="ital">disquietude of conscience:</span> “He finds them not pure in spirit.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[229] Who, moreover, in the deviations from Matthew and Mark, possesses the deciding authority (against Märcker, p. 14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16–21</span>.
