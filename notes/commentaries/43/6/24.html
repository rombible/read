It is not necessary to suppose that the whole 5,000 crossed over.

The sentence is long and involved, and this has been, as we may expect, followed by some variations in the text. “Saw,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-22.htm" title="The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one into where his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away alone;">John 6:22</a>, should be interpreted of the previous evening, and the same word here of the day of their own embarking. They knew there was only one boat, and that the disciples had gone away in it, but Jesus had not. They expected therefore to find Him among themselves, but did not. Meanwhile, other boats had come across from Tiberias.
