There may be perils and afflictions of this present time, where there is an interest in Christ. Clouds and darkness often surround the children of the light and of the day. They see Jesus walking on the sea. Even the approaches of comfort and deliverance often are so mistaken, as to become the occasions of fear. Nothing is more powerful to convince sinners than that word, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest; nothing more powerful to comfort saints than this, I am Jesus whom thou lovest. If we have received Christ Jesus the Lord, though the night be dark, and the wind high, yet we may comfort ourselves, we shall be at the shore before long.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See this miracle of walking on the sea explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm">Matthew 14:22-33</a>.

This thrilling touch in John's narrative makes it more than evident that the beloved disciple was on board. He had been expecting the Master to make his appearance in some form. He had looked long and eagerly to that point on the mountainside whither he knew that Jesus had retired. The dreary and disappointed expectation, the long and weary waiting, left an indelible impression. Their natural course towards Capernaum would have been almost parallel with the shore of <span class="cmt_word">the</span> lake; but it was dark and tempestuous, they could not steer. <span class="cmt_word">And the sea was being roused</span> from its slumber <span class="cmt_word">by reason of a high wind which was blowing.</span> If the wind came from the north, it would drift  them out into the darkness and the middle of the lake, which is there, at its widest, about five miles broad, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. forty stadia, or furlongs. The statement of the next verse comes then into undesigned coincidence with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-47.htm">Mark 6:47</a>, which shows that they were "in the midst of the sea," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. halfway from shore to shore.
