To cause death was not, then, the object in piercing the side; and yet it may have seemed to make death doubly sure. The word rendered “pierced” occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, but it is certain, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-27.htm" title="Then said he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.">John 20:27</a>, that the act caused a deep wound, and that the point of the lance therefore penetrated to the interior organs of the body.

We have to think of the disciple whom Jesus loved looking at the crucified and pierced body of his Lord, and remembering the picture in later years, and telling that there flowed from that pierced side both blood and water.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:31-37 A trial was made whether Jesus was dead. He died in less time than persons crucified commonly did. It showed that he had laid down his life of himself. The spear broke up the very fountains of life; no human body could survive such a wound. But its being so solemnly attested, shows there was something peculiar in it. The blood and water that flowed out, signified those two great benefits which all believers partake of through Christ, justification and sanctification; blood for atonement, water for purification. They both flow from the pierced side of our Redeemer. To Christ crucified we owe merit for our justification, and Spirit and grace for our sanctification. Let this silence the fears of weak Christians, and encourage their hopes; there came both water and blood out of Jesus' pierced side, both to justify and sanctify them. The Scripture was fulfilled, in Pilate's not allowing his legs to be broken, Ps 34:20. There was a type of this in the paschal lamb, Ex 12:46. May we ever look to Him, whom, by our sins, we have ignorantly and heedlessly pierced, nay, sometimes against convictions and mercies; and who shed from his wounded side both water and blood, that we might be justified and sanctified in his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>One of the soldiers - One of those appointed to watch the bodies until they were dead. This man appears to have doubted whether he was dead, and, in order to see whether he was not yet sensible, he pierced him with his spear. The Jews designed that his legs should be broken, but this was prevented by the providence of God; yet in another way more satisfactory proof was obtained of his death than would have been by the breaking of his legs. This was so ordered, no doubt, that there might be the fullest proof that he was truly dead; that it could not be pretended that he had swooned away and revived, and so, therefore, that there could not be the least doubt of his resurrection to life.<p>With a spear - The common spear which soldiers used in war. There can be no doubt that such a stroke from the strong arm of a Roman soldier would have caused death, if he had not been already dead; and it was, doubtless, to furnish this conclusive proof that he was actually dead, and that an atonement had thus been made for mankind, that John mentions so particularly this fact. Let the following circumstances be remembered, showing that death must have ensued from such a wound:<p>(1) The Saviour was elevated but a little from the ground, so as to be easily reached by the spear of a soldier.<p>(2) the wound must have been transversely upward, so as to have penetrated into the body, as he could not have stood directly under him.<p>(3) it was probably made with a strong arm and with violence.<p>(4) the spear of the Roman soldier was a lance which tapered very gently to a point, and would penetrate easily.<p>(5) the wound was comparatively a large wound. It was so large as to admit the hand <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>; but for a lance thus tapering to have made a wound so wide as to admit the hand, it must have been at least four or five inches in depth, and must have been such as to have made death certain. If it be remembered that this blow was probably in the left side, the conclusion is inevitable that death would have been the consequence of such a blow. To make out this fact was of special importance, probably, in the time of John, as the reality of the death of Jesus was denied by the Gnostics, many of whom maintained that he died in appearance only.<p>Pierced his side - Which side is not mentioned, nor can it be certainly known. The common opinion is that it was the left side. Car. Frid. Gruner (Commentatio Antiquaria Medica de Jesu Christi Morte, 30-36) has attempted to show that it must have been the left side. See Wiseman's Lectures, pp. 161, 162, and Kuinoel on <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>, where the arguments of Gruner are fully stated. It is clear that the spear pierced to the region of the heart.<p>And forthwith came ... - This was evidently a natural effect of thus piercing the side. Such a flowing of blood and water makes it probable that the spear reached the heart, and if Jesus had not before been dead, this would have closed his life. The heart is surrounded by a membrane called the pericardium. This membrane contains a serous matter or liquor resembling water, which prevents the surface of the heart from becoming dry by its continual motion (Webster). It was this which was pierced and from which the water flowed. The point of the spear also reached one of the ventricles of the heart, and the blood, yet warm, rushed forth, either mingled with or followed by the water of the pericardium, so as to appear to John to be blood and water flowing together. This was a natural effect, and would follow in any other case. Commentators have almost uniformly supposed that this was significant; as, for example, that the blood was an emblem of the eucharist, and the water of baptism, or that the blood denoted justification, and the water sanctification; but that this was the design there is not the slightest evidence.<p>It was strictly a natural result, adduced by John to establish one fact on which the whole of Christianity turns that he was truly dead. On this depends the doctrine of the atonement, of his resurrection, and all the prominent doctrines of religion. This fact it was of importance to prove, that it might not be pretended that he had only suffered a syncope, or had fainted. This John establishes. He shows that those who were sent to hasten his death believed that he had expired; that then a soldier inflicted a wound which would have terminated life if he had not been already dead; and that the infliction of this wound was followed by the fullest proof that he had truly expired. On this fact he dwells with the interest which became a subject of so much importance to the world, and thus laid the foundation for undoubted assurance that the Lord Jesus died for the sins of men. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34.

Whose name some pretend to say was Longinns, and so called from the spear with which he pierced Christ: <p>with a spear pierced his side; his left side, where the heart lies; though the painters make this wound on the right, and the Arabic version of Erpenius, as cited by Dr. Lightfoot, adds the word "right" to make the miracle the greater: this the soldier did, partly out of spite to Christ, and partly to know whether he was really dead; and which was so ordered by divine providence, that it might beyond all doubt appear that he really died, and was not taken down alive from the cross; so that there might be no room to call in question the truth of his resurrection, when he should appear alive again: <p>and forthwith came there out blood and water; this is accounted for in a natural way by the piercing of the "pericardium", which contains a small quantity of water about the heart, and which being pierced, a person, if alive, must inevitably die; but it seems rather to be something supernatural, from the asseverations the evangelist makes. This water and blood some make to signify baptism and the Lord's supper, which are both of Christ's appointing, and spring from him, and refer to his sufferings and death; rather they signify the blessings of sanctification and justification, the grace of the one being represented by water, as it frequently is in the Old and New Testament, and the other by blood, and both from Christ: that Christ was the antitype of the rock in the wilderness, the apostle assures us, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a> and if the Jews are to be believed, he was so in this instance; Jonathan ben Uzziel, in his Targum on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a> says that <p>"Moses smote the rock twice, at the first time , "blood dropped out": and at the second time abundance of waters flowed out.'' <p>The same is affirmed by others (h) elsewhere in much the same words and order. <p>(h) Shemot Rabba, sect. 3. fol. 94. 1.

Whether the blood and water issued forth <span class="ital">contemporaneously</span> or <span class="ital">after one another</span>, does not appear from the words. In the <span class="ital">natural</span>[252] mode of regarding this twofold issue, it is thought <span class="ital">either</span> (1) that Jesus was <span class="ital">not</span> yet <span class="ital">dead</span>, but simply <span class="ital">died</span> in consequence of the thrust, which pierced the pericardium with its watery lymph, and at the same time the chamber of the heart, from which the blood welled (so the two physicians Gruner in the <span class="ital">Commentat. de Jesu Chr. morte vera non simulata</span>, etc., Halle 1805), to which, however, the mode of contemplation of the entire apostolical church is opposed, which was certain, and had the personal testimonies of Christ Himself to the fact that in His <span class="ital">crucifixion itself</span> the putting to death was accomplished. <span class="ital">Or</span> (2) it is assumed that the blood had been <span class="ital">decomposed</span> in the corpse (Hase, Krabbe, and several others), so that <span class="ital">serum</span>, bloody water, and <span class="ital">placenta</span>, clots of blood, separately issued forth; which separate outflow, however, of the constituent parts of blood cannot, in the case of a fresh body that had been healthy, be anatomically established. Or (3) the <span class="ital">heart</span> is considered, just as the Gruners suppose, as having been pierced through, though the death of Jesus is assumed to have already <span class="ital">previously</span> taken place (Beza, Calvin, Grotius, Wetstein, and several others), as also Ewald, <span class="ital">Gesch. Chr</span>. p. 584 (the death of Jesus was a <span class="ital">sudden breaking of the heart</span>), holds to be most probable. Not substantially different is the view of the English physician William Stroud, <span class="ital">A Treatise on the physical cause of the death of Christ</span>, London 1847, comp. Tholuck, who, besides the cavity of the heart, brings into consideration also the two bags of the diaphragm, with the fact of their fluidity in corpses. This mode of regarding the matter renders unnecessary the entirely arbitrary theory of Ebrard, p. 563 ff., of <span class="ital">extravasations</span> and <span class="ital">sugillations</span> which the thrust occasioned,[253] and would be quite satisfactory if John had desired to give an account generally of a natural, physiological effect of the lance-thrust. But irrespective of the fact that he adduces nothing which would allow us to think in <span class="greekheb">ὕδωρ</span> not of actual <span class="ital">water</span>, but of <span class="ital">lymph</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἰχώρ</span>), he desires to set forth the phenomenon manifestly as something entirely <span class="ital">unexpected</span> (note also the <span class="greekheb">εὐθύς</span>), <span class="ital">extraordinary, marvellous</span>.

Comp. also Steinmeyer, who, however, ascribes to the water only the <span class="ital">subordinate</span> purpose, to place the blood under the point of view of the definite (purifying) operation. Luther: “our redemption is concealed in the miraculous work.” Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm" title="This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, because the Spirit is truth.">1 John 5:6</a>, where, however, <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὕδωρ</span>, agreeably to the standard of the <span class="ital">historical</span> point of view (<span class="greekheb">ἐλθών</span>), stands first. See also Weiss, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr</span>. p. 255. We must abide by this exegetical conclusion[254] (comp. Hengstenberg on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm" title="And again another scripture said, They shall look on him whom they pierced.">John 19:37</a>), and must renounce the demonstration of natural connection not less than in other miraculous appearances of the evangelical history.[255] The <span class="ital">figurative</span> interpretation or <span class="ital">explaining away of the fact itself</span> (Baur, p. 217 ff.: by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-38.htm" title="He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water....">John 7:38-39</a> : it is the representation, contemplated by the writer in a spiritual manner, of the idea that with the death of Jesus there immediately begins the fulness of spiritual life, which was to proceed from Him on behalf of the world) is only possible on the assumption that neither <span class="ital">John</span> nor He gave an <span class="ital">historical</span> account, as further Baur (see p. 272 ff.), whom Scholten follows, refers the entire narrative of the omission to break the legs, and of the side-thrust, simply to the dogmatic interest of representing Jesus as the true Paschal lamb, and thereby the turning-point at which the O. T. economy of religion ceased to exist, and the new began, the essence of which is contemplated in the blood and water that flowed out. See in opposition to Baur: Grimm in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1847, p. 181 ff., and 1849, p. 285 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[251] To this conclusion Hofmann also (<span class="ital">Weissag. u. Erfüll.</span> II. p. 148 f.) again involuntarily returned, understanding <span class="ital">undecomposed</span>, still <span class="ital">flowing</span> blood, as a sign that the body of Jesus was exempt from corruption. See, in opposition, also Luthardt. But Hofmann, in his <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 490, has renounced the above interpretation, and now has represented the matter thus: the bleeding away of the dead one had been so complete, that at last not blood, but water flowed, and this was to the apostle a proof that Jesus’ corpse remained exempt from corruption, which begins with the decomposition of the blood. Comp. also Baumgarten, p. 423 f., and Godet. But so physiological an observation and conclusion is not to be adopted without some more precise indication; and of the <span class="ital">complete</span> bleeding away on which, <span class="ital">finally</span>, water flowed, the text says nothing, but speaks simply and solely of blood and water, which issued forth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[252] In a natural way, but in a higher sense, Lange, II. p. 1614 f., explains the phenomenon from the process of <span class="ital">change</span> through which the body of Christ was passing. A precarious expedient, in which not only is the possibility of a clear representation wanting, but also the essential and necessary point of the reality of the <span class="ital">death</span>, as of the condition of separation from the body, is endangered, and instead of the <span class="ital">death</span>, the beginning of another modality of corporeal <span class="ital">life</span> is conceived; while, generally also, the process of this assumed change must have been passed through in a very material way. Besides, the body of the Risen One had not yet been transformed (He still eats, still drinks, etc.), though <span class="ital">altered</span> and become more spiritual, but the <span class="ital">transformation</span> first begins at the <span class="ital">ascension</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,...">1 Corinthians 15:51-53</a>). A possible <span class="ital">preparation</span> for this transformation from the moment of death onwards is beyond the scope of any more exact representation, and very precipitate is the conclusion that this preparation must also have announced itself by some sign in the wounded body.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[253] They originated, he thinks, through the distension of the muscles, and from them the water issued; but in penetrating deeper the lance also touched places of fluid blood.—But in this way not <span class="greekheb">αἷμα καὶ ὕδωρ</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ὕδωρ καὶ αἷμα</span> would have issued forth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[254] Fathers and artists have decked it out in monstrous colours, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Nonnus, <span class="greekheb">διδύμαις λιβάδεσσιν</span>, first blood, then <span class="greekheb">θέσκελον ὕδωρ</span> flowed; Prudentius, <span class="ital">Enchir</span>.

Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">Evang.</span> p. 317: “The redemptive death is the condition of the Christian sacrament generally, which here in its twofold form figuratively flows forth from the body of the crucified One.” This, he thinks, naturally suggested itself to John, since according to his representation Jesus was the true paschal sacrifice, the recognition of which in the <span class="ital">Gentile world</span> is brought into view by the lance-thrust of the <span class="ital">Roman</span> soldier. Other arbitrary explanations in Strauss.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[255] The symbolic signification in regard to the true <span class="ital">expiatio</span>, and the true <span class="ital">lavacrum</span>, is also assumed by Calvin; but he disputes the supernatural element in the fact: “<span class="ital">naturale</span> enim est, dum <span class="ital">coagulatur sanguis</span>, omisso rubore fieri <span class="ital">aquae similem</span>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/19.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-34.htm" title="But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water.">John 19:34</a>.

But <span class="greekheb">ἔγχεϊ νύξε</span> occurs in Homer (<span class="ital">Il.</span>, John v. 579), where death followed, and as the wound inflicted by this spear thrust seems to have been a hand-breadth wide (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-25.htm" title="The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the LORD. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.">John 20:25</a>) it may be presumed the soldier meant to make sure that Jesus was dead by giving Him a thrust which itself would have been fatal. The weapon with which the blow was inflicted was a <span class="greekheb">λόγχη</span>, the ordinary Roman <span class="ital">hasta</span>, which had an iron head, egg-shaped, and about a hand-breadth at the broadest part. Following upon the blow <span class="greekheb">εὐθὺς ἐξῆλθεν αἷμα καὶ ὕδωρ</span>. Dr. Stroud (<span class="ital">Physical Cause of the Death of Christ</span>) advocates the view that our Lord died from rupture of the heart, and thus accounts both for the speedy cessation of life and for the effusion of blood and water. Previous literature on the subject will be found in the <span class="ital">Critici Sacri</span> and select passages in Burton’s <span class="ital">Bampton Lec.</span>, 468–9. Without physiological knowledge John records simply what he saw, and if he had an eye to the Docetae, as Waterland (John v. 190) supposes, yet his main purpose was to certify the real death of Jesus. The symbolic significance of the blood and water so abundantly insisted on by the Fathers (see Burton, <span class="ital">B. L.</span>, 167–72, and Westcott’s additional note) is not within John’s horizon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34</span>. <span class="ital">pierced</span>] To make quite sure that He was dead. The Greek word is not the same as that used in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm" title="And again another scripture said, They shall look on him whom they pierced.">John 19:37</a></span>; this means either to ‘prick’ or to ‘stab,’ that to ‘pierce deeply.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">blood and water</span>] There has been very much discussion as to the <span class="ital">physical</span> cause of Christ’s death? and those who investigate this try to frame an hypothesis which will at the same time account for the effusion of blood and water. Two or three such hypotheses have been put forward. But it may be doubted whether they are not altogether out of place. It has been seen (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-30.htm" title="When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.">John 19:30</a></span>) how the Evangelists insist on the fact that the Lord’s death was a voluntary surrender of life, not a result forced upon Him. Of course it may be that the voluntariness consisted in welcoming causes which must prove fatal. But it is more simple to believe that He delivered up His life before natural causes became fatal. ‘No one,’ neither Jew nor Roman, ‘took it from Him’ by any means whatever: ‘He lays it down of Himself’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm" title="No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.">John 10:18</a>). And if we decline to investigate the physical cause of the Lord’s death, we need not ask for a physical explanation of what is recorded here. S. John assures us that he saw it with his own eyes, and he records it that we ‘may believe:’ i.e. he regards it as a ‘sign’ that the corpse was no ordinary one, but a Body that even in death was Divine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We can scarcely be wrong in supposing that the blood and water are symbolical. The order confirms this. Blood symbolizes the work of redemption which had just been completed by His death; and water symbolizes the ‘birth from above,’ with its cleansing from sin, which was the result of His death, and is the means by which we appropriate it. Thus the two great Sacraments are represented.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/19.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-34.htm" title="But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water.">John 19:34</a>. <span class="greekheb">Λὁγχῃ</span>, <span class="ital">with a lance</span> or <span class="ital">spear</span>) which would not [<span class="ital">i.e.</span> in such a way as that he did not] touch Jesus’ bones. Yet the wound was a large open one, wide enough to hold in it not merely a finger, but the whole hand: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-27.htm" title="Then said he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.">John 20:27</a>, Jesus said to Thomas, “Thrust thy <span class="ital">hand</span> into My side:” and an altogether deadly wound, if it were inflicted on any living person.—<span class="greekheb">πλευρὰν</span>, <span class="ital">side</span>) the left side perhaps.

From what quarter of the body the blood and water came, from the chest, or from the heart, or from some other part, who will define? The water was pure and real, just as the blood was pure and real: and the water is said to have flowed after the blood, that it might be perceived that the Saviour had wholly poured Himself out. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-15.htm" title="My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue sticks to my jaws; and you have brought me into the dust of death.">Psalm 22:15</a> (14), “I am poured out like water.” The verb <span class="greekheb">ἐξῆλθεν</span> may be either translated by the Singular [agreeing with each subject, <span class="greekheb">αἷμα</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὓδωρ</span>, separately] or by the Plural [the two neuter nouns being taken as a collective Plural, agreeing with the verb Singular].

Properly, the head of a spear. So Herodotus, of the Arabians: "They also had spears (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2;) tipped with an antelope's horn sharpened like a spear-point (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)" (vii., 96).

The question has been raised whether the Evangelist means to describe a gash or a prick. Another verb is rendered pierced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a>, the quotation from <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, which occurs also at <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>, with reference to Christ's crucifixion, and is used in classical Greek of putting out the eyes, or stabbing, and in the Septuagint of Saul's request to his armor-bearer: "Draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/10-4.htm">1 Chronicles 10:4</a>). The verb used here, however, &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;, is also used to describe severe and deadly wounds, as in Homer:<p>"As he sprang<p>Into his car, Idomeneus, expert<p>To wield the ponderous javelin, thrust (&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3be;) its blade<p>Through his right shoulder. From the car he fell,<p>And the dark night of death came over him."<p>"Iliad," v. 45-47.<p>It has been suggested that the body was merely pricked with the spear to ascertain if it were yet alive. There seems, on the whole, no reason for departing from the ordinary understanding of the narrative, that the soldier inflicted a deep thrust on the side of Jesus (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>); nor is it quite apparent why, as Mr. Field urges, a distinction should be kept up between the two verbs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a>.<p>Blood and water<p>It has been argued very plausibly that this was a natural phenomenon, the result of a rupture of the heart which, it is assumed, was the immediate cause of death, and which was followed by an effusion of blood into the pericardium. This blood, separated into its thicker and more liquid parts, flowed forth when the pericardium was pierced by the spear. I think, however, with Meyer, that John evidently intends to describe the incident as something entirely unexpected and marvelous, and that this explanation better suits the solemn asseveration of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-35.htm">John 19:35</a>. That the fact had a symbolic meaning to the Evangelist is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-6.htm">1 John 5:6</a>. </body></html>
