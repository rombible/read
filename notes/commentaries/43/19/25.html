The question cannot be answered with certainty; but upon the whole, the balance of evidence inclines to the view that we have four persons here mentioned in two pairs: “His mother and His mother’s sister; Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.” As early as the second century, the Peshito Syriac version adopted this view, and inserted “and” after the word sister.

Grotius justly observes, that it was a noble instance of fortitude and zeal. Now a sword (according to Simeon’s prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-35.htm" title="(Yes, a sword shall pierce through your own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.">Luke 2:35</a>) struck through her tender heart, and pierced her very soul; and perhaps the extremity of her sorrows might so overwhelm her spirits, as to render her incapable of attending the sepulchre, which we do not find that she did. Nor do we, indeed, meet with any thing after this in the sacred story concerning her, or in early antiquity: except that she continued among the disciples after our Lord’s ascension, which Luke observes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm" title="These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.">Acts 1:14</a>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And his mother’s sister, </span>&c. — See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/27-55.htm" title="And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him:...">Matthew 27:55-56</a>. <span class="ital">When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved </span>— Jesus was now in the depth of his own sufferings, yet when he saw his mother and her companions, their grief greatly affected him, particularly the distress of his mother. Therefore, though he was almost at the point of death, he spake a few words, in which he expressed his most affectionate regard to her. <span class="ital">He saith, Woman, behold thy son </span>— Meaning John. His words were intended to assure her that that disciple whom he loved would, for the sake of that love, supply the place of a son to her after he was gone; and therefore he desired her to consider him as such, and expect from him all the duty of a son. <span class="ital">And </span>— Besides expressing great filial affection toward his mother, he gave the beloved disciple also a token of his high esteem. <span class="ital">He saith to him, Behold thy mother </span>— To whom thou art now to perform the part of a son in my place; thus singling him out as that disciple on whom he could most depend to fulfil that duty, and thereby conferring upon him a peculiar honour. <span class="ital">And from that hour </span>— That is, from the time of our Lord’s death; <span class="ital">that disciple took her unto his own home — </span>And maintained her; Joseph, her husband, it seems, being dead. Thus, in the midst of the heaviest sufferings that ever human nature sustained, Jesus demonstrated a divine strength of benevolence. Even when his own distress was at the highest pitch, his friends had such a share of his concern, that their happiness for a while interrupted the feelings of his pains, and engrossed his thoughts.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:19-30 Here are some remarkable circumstances of Jesus' death, more fully related than before. Pilate would not gratify the chief priests by allowing the writing to be altered; which was doubtless owing to a secret power of God upon his heart, that this statement of our Lord's character and authority might continue. Many things done by the Roman soldiers were fulfilments of the prophecies of the Old Testament. All things therein written shall be fulfilled. Christ tenderly provided for his mother at his death. Sometimes, when God removes one comfort from us, he raises up another for us, where we looked not for it. Christ's example teaches all men to honour their parents in life and death; to provide for their wants, and to promote their comfort by every means in their power. Especially observe the dying word wherewith Jesus breathed out his soul. It is finished; that is, the counsels of the Father concerning his sufferings were now fulfilled. It is finished; all the types and prophecies of the Old Testament, which pointed at the sufferings of the Messiah, were accomplished. It is finished; the ceremonial law is abolished; the substance is now come, and all the shadows are done away. It is finished; an end is made of transgression by bringing in an everlasting righteousness. His sufferings were now finished, both those of his soul, and those of his body. It is finished; the work of man's redemption and salvation is now completed. His life was not taken from him by force, but freely given up.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let us not rend it - It would then have been useless.

So near as not only to see him, but to hear him speak: <p>his mother; the mother of Jesus, Mary; which showed her affection to Christ, and her constancy in abiding by him to the last; though it must be a cutting sight, and now was fulfilled Simeon's prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-35.htm">Luke 2:35</a> to see her son in such agonies and sorrow, and jeered and insulted by the worst of men; and though she herself was exposed to danger, and liable to be abused by the outrageous multitude; and it also showed that she stood in need, as others, of a crucified Saviour; so far was she from being a co-partner with him in making satisfaction for sin, as the Papists wickedly say: <p>and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas. The Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions distinguish Mary the wife of Cleophas from his mother's sister, by placing the copulative and between them, and so make two persons; whereas one and the same is intended, and who was the sister of Mary, the mother of Christ; not her own sister, for it is not likely that two sisters should be of the same name; but her husband Joseph's sister, and so her's; or else Cleophas was Joseph's brother, as Eusebius from Hegesippus says (k): and who was also not the daughter of Cleophas, as the Arabic version has here supplied it; much less the mother of him; but his wife, as is rightly put in our translation: for, according to the other evangelists, she was the mother of James and Joses, and who were the sons of Cleophas or Alphaeus; which are not the names of two persons, nor two names of one and the same person, but one and the same name differently pronounced; his true name in Hebrew was  or  or  "Chelphi", or "Chelphai", or "Chilphi", a name frequently to be met with in Talmudic and Rabbinic writings; and so a Jewish writer (l) observes, that  , "Chilpha is the same as Ilpha"; and in Greek may be pronounced either Cleophas, or Alphaeus, as it is both ways: ignorance of this has led interpreters to form different conjectures, as that either the husband of this Mary had two names; or that she was twice married to two different persons, once to Alphaeus, and after his death to Cleophas; or that Cleophas was her father, and Alphaeus her husband; for neither of which is there any foundation. She was no doubt a believer in Christ, and came and stood by his cross; not merely to keep her sister company, but out of affection to Jesus, and to testify her faith in him: <p>and Mary Magdalene; out of whom he had cast seven devils, and who had been a true penitent, a real believer in him, an hearty lover of him, was zealously attached to him, and followed him to the last. Three Marys are here mentioned as together; and it is observable, that the greater part of those that are taken notice of, as following Christ to the cross, and standing by it, were women, the weaker, and timorous sex, when all his disciples forsook him and fled; and none of them attended at the cross, as we read of, excepting John; no, not even Peter, who boasted so much of his attachment to him. These good women standing by the cross of Christ, may teach us to do, as they did, look upon a crucified Christ, view his sorrows, and his sufferings, and our sins laid upon him, and borne and taken away by him; we should look unto him for pardon, cleansing, and justification, and, in short, for the whole of salvation: we should also weep, as they did, whilst we look on him; shed even tears of affection for, and sympathy with him; of humiliation for sin, and of joy for a Saviour: and likewise should abide by him as they did, by his persons, offices, and grace; by the doctrine of the cross, continuing steadfastly in it; and by the ordinances of Christ, constantly attending on them, and that notwithstanding all reproaches and sufferings we may undergo. <p>(k) Emseb.

Ewald well remarks on such traits of individual significance in the Gospel of John: “it was for him at a late period of life a sweet reward to call up reminiscences of all that was most vivid, but for the readers it is also, without his will, a token that only he could have written all this.” If, indeed, the designation of the disciple <span class="ital">beloved</span> by Jesus as a <span class="ital">self</span>-designation were a <span class="ital">vanity</span> (Scholten), nay, an arrogant and scornful self-<span class="ital">exaltation</span> (Weisse), then it could <span class="ital">not</span> have been he who wrote all this. But the consciousness of pre-eminent love on the part of the Lord, true, clear, and still glowing with all intensity and strength, in the heart of the old man, is inconceivable without the deepest humility, and this humility, which has long since ceased to have anything in common with the feeling evinced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-35.htm" title="And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Master, we would that you should do for us whatever we shall desire.">Mark 10:35</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-54.htm" title="And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, will you that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did?">Luke 9:54</a>, has precisely in that most simple of all expressions, <span class="greekheb">ὃν ἠγάπα</span>, its most correspondent expression and its necessary and sacred justification, which is as little to be passed over in silence, or to be denied, as is the consciousness of Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm" title="But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[245] He does, indeed, name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-2.htm" title="There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.">John 21:2</a> his <span class="ital">father</span>. But the latter appears so without participation in the evangelical history, that he might appear to John’s mind in his Christian relation, especially in the late period of the composition of the appendix, chap. 21, more foreign and remote, and that consequently a hesitation might not exist in reference to naming him, as there did in the case of the mother, founded on a delicate and more spiritual consideration.—Scholten changes the mother into an <span class="ital">allegorical</span> person, in whom the <span class="ital">Church</span> is represented, to care for which was to be incumbent on John, not on Peter.

Of such a meaning, John gives not the slightest indication.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/19.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a>. This part of the scene is closed (that another may be introduced) with the common formula, <span class="greekheb">οἱ μὲν οὖν στρατιῶται ταῦτα ἐποίησαν</span>. (“Graeci … saepissime hujusmodi conclusiunculis utuntur.” Raphel <span class="ital">in loc.</span>) <span class="greekheb">οἱ μὲν</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἱστήκεισαν δὲ</span> … The soldiers for their part acted as has been related, but there were others beside the cross who were very differently affected. <span class="greekheb">ἡ μήτηρ</span> … <span class="greekheb">Μαγδαληνή</span>. It is doubtful whether it is meant that three or that four women were standing by the cross; for <span class="greekheb">Μαρία ἡ τοῦ Κλωπᾶ</span> may either be a further designation of <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀδελφὴ τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ</span>, or it may name the first member of a second pair of women. That four women are intended may be argued from the extreme improbability that in one family two sisters should bear the same name, Mary. The Synoptists do not name the mother of Jesus among those who were present, but Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm" title="Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.">Matthew 27:56</a>) and Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>) name Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome the mother of John. Two of these three are mentioned by John here, and it is natural to infer that the unnamed woman (<span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀδελφὴ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λ</span>.) is the third, Salome; unnamed possibly because of this writer’s shyness in naming himself or those connected with him. But the fact that Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-10.htm" title="It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.">Luke 24:10</a>) names Joanna as the third woman reflects some uncertainty on this argument. If Salome was Mary’s sister, then Jesus and John were cousins, and the commendation of Mary to John’s care is in part explained. <span class="greekheb">ἡ τοῦ Κλωπᾶ</span> may mean the mother, daughter, sister, or wife of Klopas; probably the last. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm" title="Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.">Matthew 27:56</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-10.htm" title="It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.">Luke 24:10</a>, the Mary here mentioned was the mother of James and Joses. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-3.htm" title="Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;">Matthew 10:3</a> we learn that James was the son of Alphaeus. Hence it is inferred that Klopas and Alphaeus are two slightly varying forms of the same name <span class="greekheb">תַלְפַי</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">Now there stood</span>] Or, But <span class="ital">there</span> <span class="bld">were standing</span>.

On the one hand, the four plundering soldiers with the centurion; on the other, the four ministering women with the beloved disciple.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his mother’s sister, Mary</span>] The Greek, like the English, leaves us in doubt whether we here have two women or one, whether altogether there are four women or three. The former is much the more probable alternative. (1) It avoids the very improbable supposition of two sisters having the same name. (2) S. John is fond of <span class="ital">parallel</span> expressions; ‘His mother and His mother’s sister, Mary of Clopas and Mary Magdalene’ are two pairs set one against the other. (3) S. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>) mentions Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less, and Salome. Mary Magdalene is common to both narratives, ‘Mary the mother of James the Less’ is the same as ‘Mary of Clopas:’ the natural inference is that Salome is the same as ‘His mother’s sister.’ If this is correct, (4) S. John’s silence about the name of ‘His mother’s sister’ is explained: she was his own mother, and he is habitually reserved about all closely connected with himself. We have seen already that he never mentions either his own name, or his brother’s, or the Virgin’s. (5) The very ancient Peshito or Syriac Version adopts this view by inserting ‘and’ before ‘Mary the (wife) of Clopas.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the wife of Cleophas</span>] Rather, <span class="ital">the wife of</span> <span class="bld">Clopas</span>. The Greek is simply ‘the of Clopas,’ and ‘the <span class="ital">daughter</span> of Clopas’ may be right, or ‘the <span class="ital">mother</span>,’ or even ‘the <span class="ital">sister:</span>’ but ‘wife’ is more probably to be supplied. There is no reason for identifying Clopas here with Cleopas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-18.htm" title="And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?">Luke 24:18</a> : Clopas is Aramaic, Cleopas is Greek. The spelling Cleop<span class="ital">h</span>as is a mistake derived from Latin MSS. All Greek authorities have Cleopas. If ‘wife’ is rightly inserted, and she is the mother of James the Less, Clopas is the same as Alphaeus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-3.htm" title="Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;">Matthew 10:3</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm" title="Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.">Matthew 27:56</a>). It is said that Clopas and Alphaeus may be different forms of the same Aramaic name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Mary Magdalene</span>] Introduced, like the Twelve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-67.htm" title="Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will you also go away?">John 6:67</a>) and Pilate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-29.htm" title="Pilate then went out to them, and said, What accusation bring you against this man?">John 18:29</a>) abruptly and without explanation, as being quite familiar to the readers of the Gospel. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm" title="Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.">Matthew 27:56</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-2.htm" title="And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,">Luke 8:2</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/19.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἱστήκεισαν</span>, <span class="ital">there were standing</span>) John from modesty does not mention his own mother Salome, who also stood by [<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>].—<span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀδελφὴ</span>, <span class="ital">the sister</span>) No <span class="ital">brother</span> of Mary is mentioned.

The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> of this verse implies that, in the courage of their love and tenderness, they had drawn nearer to the cross, led on as it would seem by <span class="cmt_word">his mother herself</span>, whom John with fuller knowledge mentions as the most important member of one group. John adds, and the sister of his mother, then (it must be admitted without any conjunctive <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) he adds, <span class="cmt_word">Mary</span> <span class="cmt_word">the</span> (wife) <span class="cmt_word">of Clopas, and Mary Magdalen</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> is by almost all admitted to be identifiable with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span>, Alphaeus, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a>. Consequently, "the Mary (of Clopos)" is none other than the mother of James the less-known disciple, as well as of others. And this second Mary is identically the same as the Mary spoken of in Matthew and Mark by slightly different phraseology. The question arises - Does John here speak, then, of four women? or does he say that this Mary was the sister of the Virgin Mary? If "Mary the wife of Clopas" be the sister of the Virgin, then James the less, Joses, and others are cousins of our Lord. This hypothesis has been used by those who identify these men with the "brethren of the Lord;" but it is rendered improbable by the fact referred to twice over in the synoptists and John, that his "brethren did not believe in him," and the growing certainty that "James the brother of our Lord" was not "James the less." Moreover, it is improbable that two sisters should have the same name. The other supposition is that the third woman mentioned by the synoptists (namely, Salome, the mother of Zebedee's sons) was the sister of the mother of Jesus. Against this is the non-appearance of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> between the second and third names. This absence may be simply due to the fact that John mentions "two and two," singling them out from "the many women," according to his wont. Against it, Godet and others have urged that we have no other hint of the relationship; but of many similar facts throughout the Gospel we have only the slenderest indications - take, for instance, the identification of Judas (not Iscariot) with Lebbaeus and Thaddseus; Nathanael with Bartholomew - and there is much which makes the identification natural. It is after the manner of John to omit the name of Salerno, as he always does his own throughout the Gospel and Epistles. But the entire narrative from beginning to end is illumined by the fact that John was the near relative of Jesus. The <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span> flashes into light and justification at once. Very much, both in the synoptic and Johannine narratives, receives a deeper meaning. The early friendship, the private ministry of our Lord, with John as his principal companion, the request of Salome, and the exquisite incident which now follows, all receive a richer meaning when it becomes clear that Salome was so nearly related to Jesus. In this conclusion Wieseler, Luthardt, Lange, Westcott, Sears, Moulton, Schaff, and others coincide, though Meyer and Hengstenberg take the other view. Hengstenberg thinks the tradition of three Marys is enough to counterbalance what he calls a learned device! Assuming, then, that John was so dear a friend, so near a relative, we understand better what follows. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/19.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>There stood<p>Imperfect tense, were standing.<p>Mary Magdalene<p>Strictly, the (&#x3b7;&#788;) Magdalene.
