It may be better to render the word here, as elsewhere, by “witness,” in order that we may get the full force of its frequent recurrence. The writer speaks of himself in the third person (comp. <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> p. 375), laying stress upon the specially important fact that it was an eye-witness—“he that saw it”—who testified to the fact, and one who therefore knew it to be true. The word rendered “true” in this clause is the emphatic word for “ideally true,” which is familiar to the readers of this Gospel. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>.) It answers to the idea of what evidence should be, because it is the evidence of one who himself saw what he witnesses.<p><span class= "bld">And he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</span>—The witness was ideally true, and therefore the things witnessed were actually true.

He died in less time than persons crucified commonly did. It showed that he had laid down his life of himself. The spear broke up the very fountains of life; no human body could survive such a wound. But its being so solemnly attested, shows there was something peculiar in it. The blood and water that flowed out, signified those two great benefits which all believers partake of through Christ, justification and sanctification; blood for atonement, water for purification. They both flow from the pierced side of our Redeemer. To Christ crucified we owe merit for our justification, and Spirit and grace for our sanctification. Let this silence the fears of weak Christians, and encourage their hopes; there came both water and blood out of Jesus' pierced side, both to justify and sanctify them. The Scripture was fulfilled, in Pilate's not allowing his legs to be broken, Ps 34:20. There was a type of this in the paschal lamb, Ex 12:46. May we ever look to Him, whom, by our sins, we have ignorantly and heedlessly pierced, nay, sometimes against convictions and mercies; and who shed from his wounded side both water and blood, that we might be justified and sanctified in his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that saw it - John himself.

When in the third person, in which John here speaks of <span class="ital">himself</span> while passing over His name, commentators have found the diversity of the writer and the witness betrayed (Weisse, Schweizer, Köstlin, Hilgenfeld, Tobler, Weizsäcker), this was simply a misapprehension, running counter to <span class="greekheb">κἀκεῖνος οἶδεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., of the circumstantially solemn style which fully corresponds to the quite extraordinary importance which John attributes to the phenomenon. The <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνος</span>, that is to say, is the <span class="ital">speaking subject himself</span> presented objectively, identical therefore with the <span class="greekheb">ἑωρακώς</span>, which clearly appears from the context by the pres. <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>, and the final clause <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πιστ</span>., especially also by the correlation of <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς</span> with the subject. Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-37.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he that talks with you.">John 9:37</a>. Hence we are by no means to assume that the <span class="ital">secretary</span> of the apostle speaks of him by <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνος</span> as of a third person (Ewald, <span class="ital">Jahrb</span>. 10, p. 88), but <span class="ital">the apostle himself</span> presents himself objectively as the <span class="ital">ille</span>, like a third person; he may at the same time have employed another as amanuensis (which does not follow even from chap. 21) or not; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-24.htm" title="This is the disciple which testifies of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.">John 21:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀληθνή</span>] placed with emphasis at the head of the clause (<span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> has then the next emphasis); not, however, equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἀληθής</span>, as is usually assumed, contrary to the constant usage of John (and the moment of <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθεια</span> first follows afterwards), but: a <span class="ital">true</span> testimony is <span class="ital">his</span> witness, which corresponds in reality to the idea of a <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρία</span>—namely, for the very reason that he himself has seen what he testifies. Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-16.htm" title="And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.">John 8:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>] Neither to be taken as dependent on <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἑωρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μεμαρτ</span>. (Lücke), nor as independently: “and therefore should,” etc. (De Wette), but, as the position of the words requires, stating the purpose of <span class="greekheb">λέγει</span>: he knows that he says true, says <span class="ital">that you also</span> (his readers) <span class="ital">may believe</span>, as he himself has believed through means of that miraculous appearance, namely, <span class="ital">on Jesus the Son of God</span>. As frequently in John (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>), <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span> is also here not first the entrance into faith, but <span class="ital">a higher and stronger degree of faith</span>, which one experiences, the <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span> in a new and exalted potency. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-2.htm" title="There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.">John 21:2</a>. Others, as Baeumlein, still have incorrectly referred <span class="greekheb">πιστ</span>. merely to what was last mentioned as object, whereby in truth the comparison with John himself, which lies in <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμεῖς</span>, would not be at all appropriate, because John has <span class="ital">seen</span> (not merely believed) what took place. The <span class="ital">solemn absolute</span> <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span>, with its destination of purpose, makes the assumption of special designs in view, which have been ascribed to John in his testimony of the outflow of blood and water, appear unwarranted, namely, that he desired to prove the actual death of Jesus (Beza, Grotius, and many others), especially in opposition to <span class="ital">docetic</span> error, Hammond, Paulus, Olshausen, Ammonius, Maier, and several others. Doubts of a naturalistic and docetic kind might rather have derived support than have been precluded by the enigmatic outflow, which excited the derision of Celsus, in Or. 2:36. The Valentinians maintained: <span class="greekheb">ἐξεκέντησαν δὲ τὸ φαινόμενον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἦν σὰρξ τοῦ ψυχικοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">Exc. ex Theod</span>. 62.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/19.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-35.htm" title="And he that saw it bore record, and his record is true: and he knows that he said true, that you might believe.">John 19:35</a>. When he goes on to testify, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἑμρακὼς</span> … it is not the phenomenon of the blood and water he so emphatically certifies, but the veritable death of Christ. To one who was about to relate a resurrection it was a necessary preliminary to establish the <span class="ital">bona-fide</span> death. That John here speaks of himself in the third person is quite in his manner. Here, as in chap. 20, he shows that he understood the value of an eye-witness’s testimony. It is that which constitutes his <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρία</span> as <span class="greekheb">ἀληθινή</span>, it is adequate. Besides being adequate, its contents are true, <span class="greekheb">ἀληθῆ</span>. “Testimony may be sufficient (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, of a competent eye-witness) but false; or it may be insufficient (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, of half-witted child) but true. St. John declares that his testimony is both sufficient and true.” Plummer. The reason of his utterance, or record of these facts, is <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ὑμεῖς πιστεύσητε</span>, “that ye might believe,” first, this record, and through it in Jesus and His revelation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">35</span>. <span class="ital">And he … is true</span>] Rather, <span class="ital">He that</span> <span class="bld">hath seen hath borne witness</span> <span class="ital">and his</span> <span class="bld">witness</span> <span class="ital">is true</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-19.htm" title="And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?">John 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-32.htm" title="And John bore record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it stayed on him.">John 1:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-34.htm" title="And I saw, and bore record that this is the Son of God.">John 1:34</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/8-13.htm" title="The Pharisees therefore said to him, You bore record of yourself; your record is not true....">John 8:13-14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-17.htm" title="The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bore record.">John 12:17</a>). Besides the change from ‘record’ to <span class="bld">witness</span>, for the sake of marking by uniform translation S. John’s fondness for this verb and substantive, the correction from ‘saw’ to <span class="bld">hath seen</span> must be noted. The use of the perfect rather than the aorist is evidence that the writer himself is the person who saw. If he were appealing to the witness of another person he would almost certainly have written, as the A. V., ‘he that <span class="ital">saw</span>.’ The inference that the author is the person who saw becomes still more clear if we omit the centre of the verse, which is somewhat parenthetical: ‘<span class="ital">He that hath seen hath borne witness, in order that ye all also may believe</span>.’ The natural sense of this statement is that the narrator is appealing to his own experience. Thus the Apostolic authorship of the Gospel is again confirmed. (See Westcott, <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, p. xxvii.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is true</span>] Not simply truthful, but genuine, perfect: it fulfils the conditions of sufficient evidence. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a> and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-16.htm" title="And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.">John 8:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-28.htm" title="Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.">John 7:28</a>)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">saith true</span>] Better, <span class="ital">saith</span> <span class="bld">things that are true</span>. There is no tautology, as in the A. V. S. John first says that his evidence is adequate; he then adds that the contents of it are true. Testimony may be sufficient (e.g. of a competent eyewitness) but false: or it may be insufficient (e.g. of half-witted child) but true. S. John declares that his testimony is both sufficient and true; both <span class="ital">alêthinos</span> and <span class="ital">alêthês</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that ye might</span>] Better, <span class="ital">that ye</span> also may; ye as well as the witness who saw for himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Why does S. John attest thus earnestly the trustworthiness of his narrative at this particular point? Four reasons may be assigned. This incident proved (1) the reality of Christ’s <span class="ital">humanity</span> against Docetic views; and these verses therefore are conclusive evidence against the theory that the Fourth Gospel is the work of a Docetic Gnostic (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-22.htm" title="You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.">John 4:22</a>): (2) the reality of Christ’s <span class="ital">Divinity</span>, against Ebionite views; while His human form was no mere phantom, but flesh and blood, yet He was not therefore a mere man, but the Son of God: (3) the reality of Christ’s <span class="ital">death</span>, and therefore of His <span class="ital">Resurrection</span>, against Jewish insinuations of trickery (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/28-13.htm" title="Saying, Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept....">Matthew 28:13-15</a>): (4) the clear and unexpected fulfilment of two Messianic prophecies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/19.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-35.htm" title="And he that saw it bore record, and his record is true: and he knows that he said true, that you might believe.">John 19:35</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ἑωρακὼς</span>, <span class="ital">he that saw it</span>) viz.

Concerning a third person, the writer could not have written, "He knoweth that he saith true things, that ye may believe," but rather, "We know that he saith true things, that we may believe." But John here speaks strongly of his own invincible conviction, and, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>, it is here given to induce a stronger faith on the part of his readers - not of himself and his readers in the supernatural death, in the signs that accompanied it, adapted to convince the bystanders of its marvel, and to fill up the prophetic picture, Hilgenfeld, with strange perversity, urges that the clever forger of the narrative "falls out of his part" and forgets himself (see Luthardt on 'Authorship of the Fourth Gospel,' p. 180). The symbolical and allegorical explanations are numerous. E.g. Toplady's well-known hymn, "Rock of Ages," contains the words - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Let the water and the blood,<br />From thy riven side which flowed,<br />Be of sin the double cure,<br />Cleanse me from its guilt and power."</span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/19.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He that saw it bare record (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., rendering the perfect tense in both verbs, he that hath seen hath born witness.

But <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-37.htm">John 9:37</a> shows clearly that a speaker can use this pronoun of himself; and it is, further, employed in this Gospel to indicate a person "as possessing the quality which is the point in question in an eminent or even exclusive degree" (Godet). See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>.<p>True (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;)<p>Literally, true things. As distinguished from false. Thus, by the use of the two words for true, there are brought out, as Westcott remarks, "the two conditions which testimony ought to satisfy; the first, that he who gives it should be competent to speak with authority; and the second, that the account of his experience should be exact." </body></html>
