By this is meant, of course, the power which was given to him by God, and the form in which it is expressed (“from above”) has a special force in connection with the question of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-8.htm" title="When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;">John 19:8</a>, “Whence comest Thou?” That power of which he boasted existed only because He against whom he boasts submitted to it of His own will. “He that cometh from above is above all” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-31.htm" title="He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.">John 3:31</a>). But that power was given to him of God for the carrying out of the Messianic purposes which rendered the death of Jesus necessary. The position of Pilate was that of a half-conscious agent wielding this power. He indeed had sin, for he acted against his own better nature; but not the greater sin, for he did not act against the full light of truth.<p><span class= "bld">He that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</span>—This cannot mean Judas, who is nowhere mentioned in this connection, and is excluded by the words “unto thee.” Judas delivered our Lord to the Jews. It was the Sanhedrin, and especially Caiaphas, the high priest, who, professing to represent God on earth, had delivered up the Son of God, and had declared that by the law He ought to die. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-49.htm" title="And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said to them, You know nothing at all,">John 11:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/18-14.htm" title="Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.">John 18:14-28</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:1-18 Little did Pilate think with what holy regard these sufferings of Christ would, in after-ages, be thought upon and spoken of by the best and greatest of men. Our Lord Jesus came forth, willing to be exposed to their scorn. It is good for every one with faith, to behold Christ Jesus in his sufferings. Behold him, and love him; be still looking unto Jesus. Did their hatred sharpen their endeavours against him? and shall not our love for him quicken our endeavours for him and his kingdom? Pilate seems to have thought that Jesus might be some person above the common order. Even natural conscience makes men afraid of being found fighting against God. As our Lord suffered for the sins both of Jews and Gentiles, it was a special part of the counsel of Divine Wisdom, that the Jews should first purpose his death, and the Gentiles carry that purpose into effect. Had not Christ been thus rejected of men, we had been for ever rejected of God. Now was the Son of man delivered into the hands of wicked and unreasonable men. He was led forth for us, that we might escape. He was nailed to the cross, as a Sacrifice bound to the altar. The Scripture was fulfilled; he did not die at the altar among the sacrifices, but among criminals sacrificed to public justice. And now let us pause, and with faith look upon Jesus. Was ever sorrow like unto his sorrow? See him bleeding, see him dying, see him and love him! love him, and live to him!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No power - No such power as you claim. You have not originated the power which you have. You have just as much as is given, and your ability extends no further.<p>Except it were given thee - It has been conceded or granted to you. God has ordered your life, your circumstances, and the extent of your dominion. This was a reproof of a proud man in office, who was forgetful of the great Source of his authority, and who supposed that by his own talents or fortune he had risen to his present place. Alas, how many men in office forget that God gives them their rank, and vainly think that it is owing to their own talents or merits that they have risen to such an elevation. Men of office and talent, as well as others, should remember that God gives them what they have, and that they have no influence except as it is conceded to them from on high.<p>From above - From God, or by his direction, and by the arrangements of his providence. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; "there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God." The words "from above" often refer to God or to heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a> (in the Greek). The providence of God was remarkable in so ordering affairs that a man, flexible and yielding like Pilate, should be entrusted with power in Judea. Had it been a man firm and unyielding in his duty one who could not be terrified or awed by the multitude Jesus would not have been delivered to be crucified, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>. God thus brings about his wise ends; and while Pilate was free, and acted out his nature without compulsion, yet the purposes of God, long before predicted, were fulfilled, and Jesus made an atonement for the sins of the world. Thus God overrules the wickedness and folly of men. He so orders affairs that the true character of men shall be brought out, and makes use of that character to advance his own great purposes.<p>Therefore - On this account. "You are a magistrate. Your power, as such, is given you by God. You are not, indeed, guilty for accusing me, or malignantly arraigning me; but you have power intrusted to you over my life; and the Jews, who knew this, and who knew that the power of a magistrate was given to him by God, have the greater sin for seeking my condemnation before a tribunal appointed by God, and for endeavoring to obtain so solemn a sanction to their own malignant and wicked purposes. They have endeavored to avail themselves of the civil power, the sacred appointment of God, and on this account their sin is greater." This does not mean that their sin was greater than that of Pilate, though that was true; but their sin was greater on account of the fact that they perseveringly and malignantly endeavored to obtain the sanction of the magistrate to their wicked proceedings. Nor does it mean, because God had purposed his death <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>, and given power to Pilate, that therefore their sin was greater, for God's purpose in the case made it neither more nor less. It did not change the nature of their free acts. This passage teaches no such doctrine, but that their sin was aggravated by malignantly endeavoring to obtain the sanction of a magistrate who was invested with authority by God, and who wielded the power that God gave him. By this Pilate ought to have been convinced, and was convinced, of their wickedness, and hence he sought more and more to release him.<p>He that delivered me - The singular here is put for the plural, including Judas, the high priests, and the Sanhedrin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Pilate was to look to God’s revealed will, not his secret counsels, of which he could have no knowledge; but he saith, they who had delivered him to him had the greater sin: he did act but as a judge upon their accusations; they procured the false witness, they would not be satisfied without his blood, and they sinned against much more light. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus answered,.... With great intrepidity and courage, with freedom and boldness, as being not at all dismayed with his threatenings, or affected with his proud boasts, and in order to expose the vanity of them: <p>thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: meaning, not from the Jewish sanhedrim, whose court of judicature was in the temple, which was higher than the other part of the city; nor from the Roman emperor, or senate of Rome, the higher powers; by whom Pilate was made governor of Judea, and a judge in all causes relating to life and death; but reference is had to the place from whence he came, and to the decree and council of God above, and the agreement between the eternal three in heaven. Christ speaks of a power he had against him, that is, of taking away his life; he had no lawful power to do it at all; nor any power, right or wrong, had it not been given him by God: and which is to be ascribed, not merely to the general providence of God, without which nothing is done in this world; but to the determinate counsel of God, relating to this particular action of the crucifying of Christ; otherwise Christ, as God, could have struck Pilate his judge with death immediately, and without so doing could as easily have escaped out of his hands, as he had sometimes done out of the hands of the Jews; and, as man and Mediator, he could have prayed to his Father for, and have had, more than twelve legions of angels, which would soon have rescued him: but this was not to be; power was given to Pilate from heaven against him; not for any evil he himself had committed, or merely to gratify the envy and malice of the Jews, but for the salvation of God's elect, and for the glorifying of the divine perfections: and to this the Jews themselves agree in general, <p>"that all the things of this world depend on above; and when they agree above first, (they say (s),) they agree below; and that there is no power below, until that  , "power is given from above"; and the whole of that depends on this:'' <p>therefore he that delivered me unto thee, hath the greater sin;  , "than thine", as the Syriac version adds; and to the same purpose the Persic. Pilate had been guilty of sin already in scourging Christ, and suffering the Roman soldiers to abuse him; and would be guilty of a greater in delivering him up to be crucified, who he knew was innocent: but the sin of Judas in delivering him into the hands of the chief priests and elders, and of the chief priest and elders and people of the Jews, in delivering him to Pilate to crucify him, according to the Roman manner, were greater, inasmuch as theirs proceeded from malice and envy, and was done against greater light and knowledge; for by his works, miracles, and ministry, as well as by their own prophecies, they might, or must have known, that he was the Messiah, and Son of God: and it is to be observed, that as there is a difference in sin, and that all sins are not equal, the circumstances of things making an alteration; so that God's decree concerning the delivery of his Son into the hands of sinful men, does not excuse the sin of the betrayers of him. <p>(s) Zohar in Gen. fol. 99. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/19.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-11.htm" title="Jesus answered, You could have no power at all against me, except it were given you from above: therefore he that delivered me to you has the greater sin.">John 19:11</a>. With a clear and holy defiance, to defend against this expression of personal power at least, the supremacy of the Father, Jesus now speaks His <span class="ital">last</span> word to Pilate.

That even the <span class="ital">heathen</span> could understand. Had Jesus said <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ πατρός μου</span>, he would not have understood it. Pilate stands before Jesus with the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> to destroy Him; but he has this power from <span class="ital">God</span>, and he would not possess it if God had not appointed him for the fulfilment of His destiny concerning Jesus. For this reason, however (<span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>), that is, because he here acts not in independent self-determination, but as the divinely-ordained organ of the procedure which is pending against Him, he is not indeed free from sin, since he condemns Jesus contrary to his own conviction of His innocence; but greater is the guilt of him who delivered Jesus into Pilate’s hands, since that divinely-bestowed <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> is wanting to the latter. The logical connection of the <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> rests on the fact that the <span class="greekheb">παραδιδούς μέ σοι</span> is the <span class="ital">high priest</span>, to whom, consequently, <span class="ital">no</span> power is given by God over Him, the <span class="ital">Messiah</span>, who in truth is higher than the high priest; to <span class="ital">Pilate</span>, on the other hand, the <span class="ital">Roman</span> potentate, this power is lent, because, as bearer of the highest magisterial authority, he derives his warrant from God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1</a>), to decide concerning every one who is brought before his court, and therefore also concerning the Messiah, who has been accused and delivered up as a pretender to a crown. This power Pilate possessed simply as a <span class="ital">Roman</span> potentate; hence this point of view does not <span class="ital">confuse</span> the matter (Luthardt), but makes it <span class="ital">clear</span>. As <span class="greekheb">δεδομ</span>. is not to be transmuted into the notion of <span class="ital">permission</span> (Chrysostom), so also there is nothing to be found in <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span> which is not yielded by the immediate context. Hence we are not to understand with Euth. Zigabenus (comp. Theophylact): <span class="greekheb">διότι ἐξουσίαν ἔχεις καὶ οὐκ ἀπολύεις με</span>, so that the lesser degree of guilt rests on the weakness and timidity of Pilate (comp. Luther); nor with Grotius (comp. Bengel, Baeumlein, and already Ruperti): because thou canst not know so well as the Jews (to whom <span class="greekheb">ὁ παραδ</span>. is referred) who I am; nor even with Lampe: because the Jews have received no such power from God, have rather <span class="ital">assumed</span> it to themselves (Luthardt); but solely in harmony with the context: <span class="ital">because thou hast the disposal of me, not from thy proper sovereignty, but from having been divinely empowered thereto</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ παραδιδούς</span>] <span class="ital">he who delivers me up to thee</span>; the affair is still <span class="ital">in actu</span>, those who deliver Him up stand without; hence the <span class="ital">pres</span>. The expression itself, however, cannot, as elsewhere in John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-2.htm" title="And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.">John 18:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm" title="And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;">John 13:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-21.htm" title="Then said Martha to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother had not died.">John 11:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-4.htm" title="Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,">John 12:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-64.htm" title="But there are some of you that believe not.

It is rather the chief of the Jews, <span class="ital">the high priest Caiaphas</span>, who is meant (so also Bengel, and now Ewald; comp. Luthardt, Baumgarten, p. 388, Hengstenberg), who ought to have recognised the Messiah, and not to have assumed to himself any power over Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μείζονα</span>] compares the sin of the <span class="greekheb">παραδιδούς</span> with that <span class="ital">of Pilate</span>, not with itself, so that its guilt is designated as <span class="ital">aggravated</span> by the misuse of the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> of Pilate (Calvin, Wetstein, Godet, also Baur).[236] The guilt which belonged to the <span class="greekheb">παραδιδούς</span> in and by himself, was in truth not aggravated by the delivering over <span class="ital">into the hands of the regular magistracy</span>, which was rather the orderly mode of procedure.[237]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[235] Buttmann, on account of the absence of <span class="greekheb">ἄν</span>, would interpret the reading <span class="greekheb">εἶχες</span> as follows: “<span class="ital">Thou hadst</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> when thou didst receive the accusation, against me … no power over me, unless it <span class="ital">was given</span> to thee by God for that purpose.” See <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1858, p. 501. But irrespective of the dragging in, in this necessitous manner, of this exacter definition of time in <span class="greekheb">εἶχες</span>, it is in truth precisely the <span class="ital">undoubted</span> possession of the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> which forms the presupposition of the <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. that follows. With the reading <span class="greekheb">ἔχεις</span>, which Buttmann prefers, he explains: “<span class="ital">thou hast</span> no power over me, if it <span class="ital">had not been given</span> thee from above,” p. 494. But why in that case should the <span class="ital">pluperf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἦν δεδομένον</span> stand? Instead of <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> must have been used, in conformity with the sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[236] Baur in the <span class="ital">Theol.

Pilate must be reminded that the power he vaunts is not inherently his, but is given to him for God’s purposes. From this it follows, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>, that <span class="greekheb">ὁ παραδιδούς μέ σοι</span>, “he that delivered me unto thee,” to wit, Caiaphas (although the designation being that which is constantly used of Judas it has not unnaturally been referred to him), <span class="greekheb">μείζονα ἁμαρτίαν ἔχει</span>, “hath greater sin,” not than you, Pilate (as understood by most interpreters), but greater than in other circumstances it would have been. Had Pilate been a mere irresponsible executioner their sin would have been sufficiently heinous; but in using the official representative of God’s truth and justice to fulfil their own wicked and unjust designs, they involve themselves in a darker criminality. So Wetstein: “Comparatur ergo, nisi fallor, peccatum Judaeorum cum suis circumstantiis, cum eodem peccato sine istis circumstantiis: hoc Judaeos aggravat, eosque atrocioris delicti reos agit, quod non per tumultum sed per Praesidem, idque specie juris, me quaerunt de medio tollere”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Thou couldest</span>] Or, <span class="bld">wouldest</span>. This is Christ’s last word to Pilate; a defence of the supremacy of God, and a protest against the claim of any human potentate to be irresponsible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from above</span>] i.e. from God. This even Pilate could understand: had Jesus said ‘from My Father’ he would have remained uninstructed. The point is not, that Pilate is an instrument ordained for the carrying out of God’s purposes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:">Acts 2:23</a>); he was such, but that is not the meaning here.

Pilate, when he heard mention, however, made of the Son of God, was afraid: Caiaphas, when he had heard from the Lord Himself that He was the Son of God, called Him a blasphemer, and judicially pronounced Him “guilty of death” [<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-65.htm" title="Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy....">Matthew 26:65-66</a>].<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wouldst not have</span> <span class="cmt_word">authority against me of any kind,</span> either judicial or actual, or both combined: thou wouldst hold no judicial position which I or others could recognize, nor wouldst thou have the faintest power to proceed against me unless, etc. Here our Lord points to the great doctrine which Paul afterwards expressed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>) about the powers that be, and hints that every circumstance and event which led to Pilate's occupancy of that judgment-seat, or which in recent times had delivered up the people of the Lord to the authority of Rome, and prepared for the occupancy of the Praetorium by Pontius Pilate himself, was altogether beyond the range of his judge's spontaneity and competency. <span class="cmt_word">Unless it were given thee from above</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). He does not say, "from my Father," or "from God" - phrases which would have been incomprehensible to a skeptical heathen; but "from above," from that Divine providential source of all power which rules all. The Lord thus implies the Divine legitimation of the judicial rank of Pilate; and the fact that his continuous occupancy of it was a talent revocable in a moment by the hand that gave it, and that all the exercise of his so-called <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> was dependent on his supreme will. <span class="cmt_word">For this cause he that delivered</span> <span class="cmt_word">me up to thee.</span> Though Judas is continually described as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-2.htm">John 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-21.htm">John 11:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-64.htm">John 6:64-71</a>), yet we have already seen that the act of Judas had been endorsed by the people, and by the Sanhedrin, who now by their highest official representative had "delivered" him up to Pilate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-35.htm">John 18:35</a>, note), betrayed him with murderous intention to the power which could not merely excommunicate, but could kill by judicial process. Our Lord may either refer to Caiaphas (Bengel, Meyer, Luthardt) or to the Sanhedrin and people as a whole (Godet). <span class="cmt_word">Hath greater sin</span>. "Because the initiative has been taken by him, and irrespective of thee; because thy power, such as it is over me, is a Divine arrangement, made irrespective of thy will; and the whole of this proceeding has been forced upon thee against thy better  judgment." Nevertheless, he implies that Pilate has sinned: he was exercising his seeming judicial rights irrespective of justice. He had declared Jesus to be free from blame or charge in open court, but he had nevertheless submitted the innocent Sufferer to the utmost wrong; but he that delivered Christ-to Pilate had done so out of willful ignorance, and was sinning against light and knowledge. Caiaphas might have recognized Christ's true Messiahship, and accepted his true claims, and bowed before him as the Sent of God, as the Son of the Blessed; but instead of this he had violated the law, and sacrificed the hope and spiritual independence of his own people, out of deference to the sacrosanct honors of his own order. Pilate's consciousness of independence is rebuked, and his conscience appealed to, and the Lord, in this last word to his judge, claims to be his Suzerain, and awards to him his share of blame. Pilate said to the Jews, "I find no fault in him;" Jesus said to Pilate, "Thou hast committed a great sin, though there is another God-given <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, which is more seriously and culpably trifled with than thine is: he that delivered me to thee hath committed a greater." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/19.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He that delivered<p>Caiaphas. </body></html>
