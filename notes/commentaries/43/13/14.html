Those whom Christ loves, he loves to the end. Nothing can separate a true believer from the love of Christ. We know not when our hour will come, therefore what we have to do in constant preparation for it, ought never to be undone. What way of access the devil has to men's hearts we cannot tell. But some sins are so exceedingly sinful, and there is so little temptation to them from the world and the flesh, that it is plain they are directly from Satan. Jesus washed his disciples' feet, that he might teach us to think nothing below us, wherein we may promote God's glory, and the good of our brethren. We must address ourselves to duty, and must lay aside every thing that would hinder us in what we have to do. Christ washed his disciples' feet, that he might signify to them the value of spiritual washing, and the cleansing of the soul from the pollutions of sin. Our Lord Jesus does many things of which even his own disciples do not for the present know the meaning, but they shall know afterward. We see in the end what was the kindness from events which seemed most cross. And it is not humility, but unbelief, to put away the offers of the gospel, as if too rich to be made to us, or too good news to be true. All those, and those only, who are spiritually washed by Christ, have a part in Christ. All whom Christ owns and saves, he justifies and sanctifies. Peter more than submits; he begs to be washed by Christ. How earnest he is for the purifying grace of the Lord Jesus, and the full effect of it, even upon his hands and head! Those who truly desire to be sanctified, desire to be sanctified throughout, to have the whole man, with all its parts and powers, made pure. The true believer is thus washed when he receives Christ for his salvation. See then what ought to be the daily care of those who through grace are in a justified state, and that is, to wash their feet; to cleanse themselves from daily guilt, and to watch against everything defiling. This should make us the more cautious. From yesterday's pardon, we should be strengthened against this day's temptation. And when hypocrites are discovered, it should be no surprise or cause of stumbling to us. Observe the lesson Christ here taught. Duties are mutual; we must both accept help from our brethren, and afford help to our brethren. When we see our Master serving, we cannot but see how ill it becomes us to domineer. And the same love which led Christ to ransom and reconcile his disciples when enemies, still influences him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye also ought to wash ... - Some have understood this literally as instituting a religious rite which we ought to observe; but this was evidently not the design; because:<p>1. There is no evidence that Jesus intended it as a religious observance, like the Lord's Supper or the ordinance of baptism.<p>2. It was not observed by the apostles or the primitive Christians as a religious rite.<p>3. It was a rite of hospitality among the Jews, a common, well-known thing, and performed by servants.<p>4. It is the manifest design of Jesus here to inculcate a lesson of humility; to teach them by his example that they ought to condescend to the most humble offices for the benefit of others. They ought not to be proud, and vain, and unwilling to occupy a low place, but to regard themselves as the servants of each other, and as willing to befriend each other in every way. And especially as they were to be founders of the church, and to be greatly honored, he took this occasion of warning them against the dangers of ambition, and of teaching them, by an example that they could not forget, the duty of humility. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Some of the ancients seem to have judged this washing of feet to have been instituted as a sacrament, (though in an improper sense), and from hence, though Bellarmine, Maldonate, and others deny it to be a sacrament as well as we, yet probably is the practice in use amongst the papists, to wash certain persons’ feet every Thursday before Easter; a theatrical ceremony, rather than any thing of solid and profitable use. Our Saviour certainly intends no more by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">ye ought to wash one another’s feet, </span> than, ye ought to serve one another in all offices of love, and not to think yourselves too good, or too great, to do the meanest services to those who are my disciples: and this is that as to which he tells them he had set them an example that they should do as he had done, in other acts of the same kind, though not as to this specific act. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If I then your Lord and Master,....

It is not the act itself, but its moral essence, which, after His example, He enjoins upon them to exercise. This moral essence, however, consists not in lowly and ministering love <span class="ital">generally</span>, in which Jesus, by washing the feet of His disciples, desired to give them an example, but, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-10.htm" title="Jesus said to him, He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but not all.">John 13:10</a> proves, in <span class="ital">the</span> ministering love which, in all self-denial and humility, <span class="ital">is active for the moral purification and cleansing of others</span>. As Jesus had just set forth <span class="ital">this</span> ministering love by His own example, when He, although their Lord and Master, performed on the persons of His disciples the servile duty of washing their feet,—as an emblem, however, of the efficacy of His love to purify them spiritually,—so ought they to wash one another’s feet; <span class="ital">i.e. with the same self-denying love to be reciprocally serviceable to one another with a view to moral purification</span>.

Ambrose, <span class="ital">de sacram</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-1.htm" title="There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:">John 3:1</a>; Augustine, <span class="ital">ad Januar. cp</span>. 119) by the introduction of the washing of the feet of the baptized on Maundy Thursday, and other symbolical feet-washings (later also amongst the Mennonites and in the community of Brothers). <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm" title="Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.">1 Timothy 5:10</a> contains the non-ritualistic reference to hospitality. The feet-washing by the <span class="ital">Pope</span> on Maundy Thursday is a result of the pretension to represent Christ, and as such, also, was strongly condemned by the Reformers. Justly, however, the church has not adopted the feet-washing into the number of the <span class="ital">sacraments;</span> for it is not the practice itself, but only the spiritual action, which it thoughtfully represents, that Jesus enjoined upon the disciples. And it is solely to this moral meaning that the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-17.htm" title="If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.">John 13:17</a> is attached; and hence the essential marks of the specific sacramental idea, corresponding to the essence of baptism and of the Supper—sacramental institution, promise, and collative force—are wanting to it. This in answer to Böhmer, in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1850, p. 829 ff., who designates it an offence against Holy Scripture, that the Protestant church has not recognised the feet-washing as a sacrament, which, outside the Greek church,[128] it was explained to be by Bernard of Clairvaux (“Sacramentum <span class="ital">remissionis peccatorum quotidianorwn</span>”), without any permanent result. Baeumlein also expresses himself in favour of the maintenance of the practice as a legacy of Christ. But its <span class="ital">essence</span> is preserved, where the <span class="ital">love</span>, from which the practice flowed, abides.

The Lord High Almoner washed the feet of the recipients of the royal ‘maundy’ as late as 1731. James 2 was the last English sovereign who went through the ceremony. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm" title="Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.">1 Timothy 5:10</a> ‘washing the saints’ feet’ is perhaps given rather as a <span class="ital">type</span> of devoted charity than as a definite act to be required.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-14.htm" title="If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.">John 13:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ ὑμεῖς</span>, <span class="ital">ye also</span>) The washing of their feet, which the Lord performed for His disciples, had as its object both the benefit of conferring on them complete purity, and the inculcation of the lesson of humble love, which they needed to be taught: <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-34.htm" title="A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.">John 13:34</a>, with which comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.">John 13:1</a>, “A new commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.” “Having loved His own—He loved them to the end.” Thence it follows, that the disciples’ mutual washing of one another’s feet has this as its object, that one should assist the other in every possible way towards attaining purity of soul; and that one should wash the feet of the other, <span class="ital">either</span> literally, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm" title="Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.">1 Timothy 5:10</a>, “well reported for good works;—if she have washed the saints’ feet,” and that in good earnest, if, namely, it should happen to be needed: for it is an affirmative [<span class="ital">positive</span>] precept, obligatory always [where needed], but not under all circumstances [<span class="ital">i.e</span>. not, where it is not needed], such as is also the character of that precept, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-16.htm" title="Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.">1 John 3:16</a>, “We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren;” <span class="ital">or</span> the precept is to be obeyed ‘synecdochically’ [<span class="ital">i.e</span>. the <span class="ital">one</span> particular of washing feet being put for the <span class="ital">whole</span> circle of offices of self-denying love], by means of all kinds of offices which one can render to another, even servile and mean offices, if only the occasion require them. Therefore the Lord, by the very act of washing their feet, purified the disciples; wherefore also He lovingly compelled Peter to submit to it: but it was not on this account [with a view to purification thereby] that He enjoined on the disciples mutual washing of one another’s feet; nor is there such great necessity of imitating up to the very letter the Lord’s act of feet washing, as some have decided there is: inasmuch as, for instance, John on no occasion washed the feet of Thomas: and yet there is a greater similarity between the cases of feet-washing by the Lord, and that by brethren mutually, than most persons recognise. In our day, popes and princes imitate the feet-washing to the letter; but a greater subject for admiration would be, for instance, a pope, in unaffected humility, washing the feet of one king [his own equal in rank, and so the exact analogue to the disciples’ mutual washing as brethren] than the feet of twelve paupers.

The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> shows that he had set before his disciples a parallel, an example, a symbolic type of the service they were to render to one another, and was not establishing a custom or exact ordinance. The washing of the feet was an Oriental custom of great antiquity as a mark of hospitality (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; Abigail, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-41.htm">1 Samuel 25:41</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-38.htm">Luke 7:38, 44</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm">1 Timothy 5:10</a> there is trace of such a custom of Christian hospitality. Considering the ease with which the Church has established a ceremonial from an isolated text, it is remarkable that no more literal use has been made of this injunction. However, <span class="accented">Maundy Thursday</span>, a name derived from <span class="accented">Dies mandati</span>, was celebrated as the day on which this great command, or that contained in ver. 34, was <span class="accented">given - Mandatum novum do vobis - and</span> the feet of the newly baptized were washed. The endeavor to make Augustine the authority for this religious practice is doubtful; but the Council of Toledo (A.D. 694) mentions this particular day as that on which it was appropriate. In the early Gallican Church there was such a ritual, and the forms of <span class="accented">pedilavium</span> observed are to be read in early Gothic and Galliean missals. Bernard of Clairvaux tried to convert the ceremony into a sacrament, but without success. And it would seem that some effort was made to introduce it into Spain. "In 1530, Wolsey washed, wiped, and kissed the feet of fifty-nine poor men at Peterborough. The practice was continued by English sovereigns till the reign of James II." (Westcott). No traces of it are to be found in the Ambrosian ritual, but the preservation of the custom is found now in the Russian imperial palace, in the ceremonies of the holy week at Rome, and in the palaces of Vienna, Madrid,Munich. The practice was for a time retained by the United Brethren and Mennonites, and the Tunkers of Philadelphia (see 'Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,' vol. 1. arts. "Baptism," &sect;&sect; 34, 67, and "Maundy Thursday;" Herzog., 'Encyc.,' art. "Fusswaschung," by H. Merz; and Schaff's 'Herzog.,' art. "Tunkers"). The Church has for the most part looked below the mere form to the real substance of the Lord's teaching, and only thus can we appreciate it adequately. The very injunction would be an inadequate, burdensome one where the feet are covered, and would become impossible and valueless in the Northern and Western world. The service demanded is the self-forgetting ministry of love, which places the interests of self behind and below those of others. Nothing is more theoretically easy and acceptable than this principle, but nothing more difficult of accomplishment. This sentence of our Lord is a noble illustration of the method in which a great principle is made by him the basis of a small duly (cf. Paul's vindication of his own truthfulness and freedom from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17-20</a>; he based it on God's own faithfulness to promise). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Your<p>Inserted in A.V.
