The pronouns are emphatic. “<span class= "ital">He</span> it is for whom <span class= "ital">I</span> . . .”The word “morsel” or “sop” occurs in the New Testament only in this context. The meaning is illustrated by the use in the LXX. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm" title="And Boaz said to her, At mealtime come you here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left.">Ruth 2:14</a> (“Come thou hither, and thou shalt eat of the bread and dip thy <span class= "ital">morsel</span> in the vinegar”); and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-17.htm" title="Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless has not eaten thereof;">Job 31:17</a> (“And if I ate my <span class= "ital">morsel</span> alone, and did not impart it to the orphan”). The cognate verb occurs twice in the New Testament—<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-20.htm" title="Therefore if your enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing you shall heap coals of fire on his head.">Romans 12:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-3.htm" title="And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing.">1Corinthians 13:3</a>. (See Notes on these passages.) The original root of the word means “to rub.” Hence it is “anything rubbed or broken off.” It was often used for a mouthful just like “morsel,” which means literally, <span class= "ital">a little bite.</span> As used here, the word means any portion of food. The general explanation that the morsel was dipped in the <span class= "ital">Charosheth</span> (comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-28.htm" title="For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.">Matthew 26:28</a>) implies that this supper was the Paschal Supper. (See <span class= "ital">Excursus F: The Day of the Crucifixion of our Lord.</span>)<p>Our Lord would preside at the meal, and distribute to each guest his portion. When John asked the question, He was about to give the morsel to Judas. He avoids the name, and makes the act which He is about to perform convey the answer to the question. That act is the token of friendship and love which even now would redeem the heart full of treachery, if that heart would but receive it. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">He gave it to Judas Iscariot.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">He takes and gives</span> . . . , with the majority of good MSS.

(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-2.htm" title="And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;">John 13:2</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:18-30 Our Lord had often spoken of his own sufferings and death, without such trouble of spirit as he now discovered when he spake of Judas. The sins of Christians are the grief of Christ. We are not to confine our attention to Judas. The prophecy of his treachery may apply to all who partake of God's mercies, and meet them with ingratitude. See the infidel, who only looks at the Scriptures with a desire to do away their authority and destroy their influence; the hypocrite, who professes to believe the Scriptures, but will not govern himself by them; and the apostate, who turns aside from Christ for a thing of naught. Thus mankind, supported by God's providence, after eating bread with Him, lift up the heel against Him! Judas went out as one weary of Jesus and his apostles. Those whose deeds are evil, love darkness rather than light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jesus answered - That is, he answered John. It does not appear that either Judas or the other apostles heard him.<p>Shall give a sop - The word translated "sop" means a morsel, a piece of bread, or anything else eaten - as much as we are accustomed to take at a mouthful. Jesus was about to dip it in the sauce which was used at the Passover. The word "dip," in the original, is that from which is derived the word "baptize." It means here that Jesus would dip it into the sauce as we do a piece of bread. It is probable that it was not an unusual thing for the master of a feast to help others in this way, as it does not appear to have attracted the attention of the others as at all remarkable. It was an indication to John who the betrayer was, and a hint which Judas also probably understood. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

Without question all the evangelists speak of the same time; for it is not reasonable to think that this discovery should be made, and Judas gone out, and that afterward he should return again to eat the passover. This maketh me very inclinable to think, that though the washing of the feet might be during the time of a common supper, preceding the passover, yet the supper they were now at was the passover supper: where, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Were none but he and the twelve disciples. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. It is plain they were in that leaning posture, not used at common meals, but on the passover nights (as Dr. Lightfoot tells us from their writings). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. The discourse passed at the table is the very same (though not in words, yet in sense) with that mentioned by Matthew and Luke, at the passover supper. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. It is not reasonable to think that after such a discovery as Christ now made of the traitor, he should come again to be pointed at and exposed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Concerning the sop, what it was, hath been some question; and a learned writer of our own (but in this point I think much too critical) hath increased the difficulty, by affirming the word here used, qwmion, signifies a piece of bread, or the lower part or chippings of the bread; for which he quotes Hesychius, who indeed doth say so of qwyion, but not qwmion. The learned annotator thinks qwyion is a false print for qwmion, but it cannot be: for, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. There are in Hesychius several words in alphabetical order, between qwyion, and this word. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Though qwmion be not in Hesychius, yet qwmh is, and expounded by him ta merh, parts; now all know that this qwmion, which is but a diminutive derived from qwmov or qwmh, can signify no more than a little part, let it be of what it will; for it is manifest out of Homer, that, joined with an adjective, it signifies a mouthful of man’s flesh, which came out of the Cyclops’ mouth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So as the sense of these words is, He it is to whom I shall give a little part or portion of meat, when I have dipped it. And having dipped it, <span class="ital">he gave it to Judas the son of Simon:</span> not the Judas who wrote the Epistle, and who is mentioned, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-22.htm" title="Judas said to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?">John 14:22</a></span>, but he that was the son of Simon, called from his place which he lived in, Kiroth, <span class="ital">Iscariot:</span> by which he did as perfectly describe the traitor as if he had named him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus answered, he it is,....

This was not the passover sop, which was dipped into a sauce made of various things, called by the Jews  for this was not the "paschal" supper, but a common supper at a private house, two days before the feast of the passover; but this sop, or rather crust of bread, which whether dipped into a liquid, or only a piece of dry bread, which Christ dipped his hand into the dish for, and took, as some think, is not very material, was a piece of common bread, which Christ took up, without regard to any custom, or ceremony used at any feasts, and gave it to the betrayer, as a sign by which John might know him: <p>and when he, had dipped the sop; either into some sort of broth, or any other liquid, or had dipped his hand into the dish for it: <p>he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon; so called, to distinguish him from another apostle, whose name was Judas, and was then present. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.

But even in answer to John’s question, <span class="greekheb">τίς ἐστιν</span>; Jesus does not name Judas, but merely gives a sign by which John may recognise the traitor: <span class="greekheb">Ἐκεῖνος</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐπιδώσω</span>, “he it is for whom I shall dip the sop and give it him”. Some argue from the insertion of the article <span class="greekheb">τὸ ψωμίον</span> that this was the sop made up of a morsel of lamb, a small piece of unleavened bread, and dipped in the bitter sauce, which was given by the head of the house to each guest as a regular part of the Passover; and that therefore John as well as the Synoptists considered this to be the Paschal Supper. But not only is the article doubtful, see W.H[84], but it is an ordinary Oriental custom for the host to offer such a tid-bit to any favoured guest; and we are rather entitled to see in the act the last appeal to Judas’ better feeling. The very mark Jesus chooses to single him out is one which on ordinary occasions was a mark of distinctive favour. At any rate he is thus all the more effectually screened from the others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[84] Westcott and Hort.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it</span>] The text here is uncertain, but there is no doubt as to the meaning. Perhaps the better reading is, <span class="bld">for whom I shall dip the morsel and give it to him</span>. Copyists have possibly tried to correct the awkwardness of ‘for whom’ and ‘to him.’ In any case ‘sop’ or ‘morsel’ must have the article. The Greek word is derived from ‘rub’ or ‘break,’ and means ‘a piece broken off:’ it is still the common word in Greece for ‘bread.’ To give such a morsel at a meal was an ordinary mark of goodwill, somewhat analogous to taking wine with a person in modern times. Christ, therefore, as a forlorn hope, gives the traitor one more mark of affection before dismissing him. It is the last such mark: ‘Friend, wherefore art thou come?’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-50.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.">Matthew 26:50</a>) should rather be ‘Comrade, (do that) for which thou art come,’ and is a sorrowful rebuke rather than an affectionate greeting. Whether the morsel was a piece of the unleavened bread dipped in the broth of bitter herbs depends upon whether this supper is regarded as the Paschal meal or not.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And when</span>, &c.] The true reading is, <span class="bld">Therefore</span>, <span class="ital">when He had dipped the</span> <span class="bld">morsel He taketh and giveth it</span>.

The act of Jesus was almost contemporaneous with the "Thou sayest it" of the synoptists It was twofold in meaning, explaining to John what he wished to know fur Peter's sake, and giving Judas one more gracious chance to repent and believe in the Divinity of love rather than that of display, power, and pomp. Judas had been dipping his hand into the same dish with his Master, eating his bread. Instead of resenting such effrontery the blessed Lord gave him in pity the last opportunity to escape, he puts the morsel sopped in the acid wine, the bread of fellowship, into his very lips, and the miscreant received it. The name of Judas, and of his father, and of the place cursed by being his birthplace, are once more introduced at length (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-71.htm">John 6:71</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>To whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it (&#x3c9;&#787;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;)<p>The best texts read &#x3c9;&#787;&#834;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;, for whom I shall dip the sop and give it him.<p>Sop (&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Only in this chapter. Diminutive from &#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, a morsel, which, in turn, is from &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;, to rub, or to crumble. Homer, of the Cyclops:<p>"Then from his mouth came bits (&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;) of human flesh<p>Mingled with wine."<p>"Odyssey," ix., 374.<p>And Xenophon: "And on one occasion having seen one of his companions at table tasting many dishes with one bit (&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;) of bread" ("Memorabilia," iii., 14, 15). The kindred verb &#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;, rendered feed, occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>. See also Septuagint, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-5.htm">Psalm 79:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a>. According to its etymology, the verb means to feed with morsels; and it was used by the Greeks of a nurse chewing the food and administering it to an infant. So Aristophanes: "And one laid the child to rest, and another bathed it, and another fed (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;) it" ("Lysistrate," 19, 20). This sense may possibly color the word as used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a> : "If thine enemy hunger, feed (&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;) him;" with tender care. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>, the original sense appears to be emphasized: "Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor (&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;)." This idea is that of doling away in morsels. Dean Stanley says: "Who that has witnessed the almsgiving in a Catholic monastery, or the court of a Spanish or Sicilian bishop's or archbishop's palace, where immense revenues are syringed away in farthings to herds of beggars, but must feel the force of the Apostle's half satirical &#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;?"<p>Dipped the sop<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-20.htm">Mark 14:20</a>. The regular sop of the Paschal supper consisted of the following things wrapped together: flesh of the Paschal lamb, a piece of unleavened bread, and bitter herbs. The sauce into which it was dipped does not belong to the original institution, but had been introduced before the days of Christ. According to one authority it consisted of only vinegar and water (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>); others describe it as a mixture of vinegar, figs, dates, almonds, and spice. The flour which was used to thicken the sauce on ordinary occasions was forbidden at the Passover by the Rabbins, lest it might occasion a slight fermentation. According to some, the sauce was beaten up to the consistence of mortar, in order to commemorate the toils of the Israelites in laying bricks in Egypt.<p>To Judas Iscariot the son of Simon (&#x399;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x399;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;).<p>The best texts read &#x399;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;.

The act was a mark of forbearance and goodwill toward the traitor, and a tacit appeal to his conscience against the contemplated treachery. </body></html>
