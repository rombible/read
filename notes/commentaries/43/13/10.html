St. Peter’s words have implied that he was wholly unclean, and needed for feet, and head, and hands, for the whole man, a moral cleansing. Christ answers that this was not so. The man who has been bathed is clean, but his feet coming in contact with the dust of the road need to be washed. It was so morally. They had been cleansed; their whole moral life had been changed, but they were liable to the corruption of every-day life through which they walked, and needed to be cleansed from the pollution of it. That day had furnished an example; their pride and self-seeking was of the spirit of the world, and not of the spirit of Christ; His act was a cleansing from that, but it did not imply that they were not clean. The lesson is that all, from Apostles downwards, need the daily renewing of the grace of God; and that none should find in failure, or even in the evil which clings to his daily path, reason for questioning the reality of the moral change which has made him the child of God.<p><span class= "bld">And ye are clean, but not all.</span>—This is the moral application, accompanied by the mournful thought that it was not true of all. One there was among those who had been bathed who had allowed evil to enter into his heart and pollute it. For him cleansing had been neglected, and the daily corruption of the world had remained; evil thoughts had been harboured, until at length they had made corrupt the whole man. (Comp.

Those whom Christ loves, he loves to the end. Nothing can separate a true believer from the love of Christ. We know not when our hour will come, therefore what we have to do in constant preparation for it, ought never to be undone. What way of access the devil has to men's hearts we cannot tell. But some sins are so exceedingly sinful, and there is so little temptation to them from the world and the flesh, that it is plain they are directly from Satan. Jesus washed his disciples' feet, that he might teach us to think nothing below us, wherein we may promote God's glory, and the good of our brethren. We must address ourselves to duty, and must lay aside every thing that would hinder us in what we have to do. Christ washed his disciples' feet, that he might signify to them the value of spiritual washing, and the cleansing of the soul from the pollutions of sin. Our Lord Jesus does many things of which even his own disciples do not for the present know the meaning, but they shall know afterward. We see in the end what was the kindness from events which seemed most cross. And it is not humility, but unbelief, to put away the offers of the gospel, as if too rich to be made to us, or too good news to be true. All those, and those only, who are spiritually washed by Christ, have a part in Christ. All whom Christ owns and saves, he justifies and sanctifies. Peter more than submits; he begs to be washed by Christ. How earnest he is for the purifying grace of the Lord Jesus, and the full effect of it, even upon his hands and head! Those who truly desire to be sanctified, desire to be sanctified throughout, to have the whole man, with all its parts and powers, made pure. The true believer is thus washed when he receives Christ for his salvation. See then what ought to be the daily care of those who through grace are in a justified state, and that is, to wash their feet; to cleanse themselves from daily guilt, and to watch against everything defiling. This should make us the more cautious. From yesterday's pardon, we should be strengthened against this day's temptation. And when hypocrites are discovered, it should be no surprise or cause of stumbling to us. Observe the lesson Christ here taught. Duties are mutual; we must both accept help from our brethren, and afford help to our brethren. When we see our Master serving, we cannot but see how ill it becomes us to domineer. And the same love which led Christ to ransom and reconcile his disciples when enemies, still influences him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that is washed - This is a difficult passage, and interpreters have been divided about its meaning. Some have supposed that it was customary to bathe before eating the paschal supper, and that the apostles did it; Jesus having said, "he that hath bathed his body is clean except in regard to his feet - to the dirt contracted in returning from the bath, and that there was need only that the feet should be washed in order to prepare them properly to receive the supper." They suppose, also, that the lesson which Jesus meant to teach was that they were really pure <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>; that they were qualified to partake of the ordinances of religion, and needed only to be purified from occasional blemishes and impurities (Grotius). Others say that there is not evidence that the Jews bathed before partaking of the Paschal Supper, but that reference is made to the custom of washing their hands and their face. It is known that this was practiced. See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a> note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-3.htm">Mark 7:3-4</a> notes. Peter had requested him to wash his hands and his head. Jesus told him that as that had been done, it was unnecessary to repeat it; but to wash the feet was an act of hospitality, the office of a servant, and that all that was needed now was for him to show this condescension and humility. Probably reference is had here to internal purity, as Jesus was fond of drawing illustrations from every quarter to teach them spiritual doctrine; as if he had said, "You are clean by my word and ministry <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>; you are my followers, and are prepared for the scene before you. But one thing remains. And as, when we come to this rite, having washed, there remains no need of washing except to wash the feet, so there is now nothing remaining but for me to show you an example that you will always remember, and that shall complete my public instructions to you."<p>Is clean - This word may apply to the body or the soul.<p>Every whit - Altogether, wholly.<p>Ye are clean - Here the word has doubtless reference to the mind and heart.<p>But not all - You are not all my true followers, and fitted for the ordinance before us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. He that is washed&#8212;in this thorough sense, to express which the word is carefully changed to one meaning to wash as in a bath.<p>needeth not&#8212;to be so washed any more.<p>save to wash his feet&#8212;needeth to do no more than wash his feet (and here the former word is resumed, meaning to wash the hands or feet).<p>but is clean every whit&#8212;as a whole. This sentence is singularly instructive. Of the two cleansings, the one points to that which takes place at the commencement of the Christian life, embracing complete absolution from sin as a guilty state, and entire deliverance from it as a polluted life (Re 1:5; 1Co 6:11)&#8212;or, in the language of theology, Justification and Regeneration. This cleansing is effected once for all, and is never repeated. The other cleansing, described as that of "the feet," is such as one walking from a bath quite cleansed still needs, in consequence of his contact with the earth. (Compare Ex 30:18, 19). It is the daily cleansing which we are taught to seek, when in the spirit of adoption we say, "Our Father which art in heaven &#8230; forgive us our debts" (Mt 6:9, 12); and, when burdened with the sense of manifold shortcomings&#8212;as what tender spirit of a Christian is not?&#8212;is it not a relief to be permitted thus to wash our feet after a day's contact with the earth? This is not to call in question the completeness of our past justification. Our Lord, while graciously insisting on washing Peter's feet, refuses to extend the cleansing farther, that the symbolical instruction intended to be conveyed might not be marred.<p>and ye are clean&#8212;in the first and whole sense.<p>but not all&#8212;important, as showing that Judas, instead of being as true-hearted a disciple as the rest at first, and merely falling away afterwards&#8212;as many represent it&#8212;never experienced that cleansing at all which made the others what they were.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Look as it is with persons that have been washing themselves in a bath, when they are washed, yet walking abroad barefoot, or with thin sandals or coverings for their feet, will be again subject to pollute and dirty their feet, so as they will have frequent need to wash them again; but they need not soon again wash their whole bodies: so it is as to souls that are washed with my blood; washed, and sanctified, justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of God, (as the apostle speaketh, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-11.htm" title="And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.">1 Corinthians 6:11</a></span>), their state is not to be renewed; they need not be justified a second time; but they will have need to have their feet washed, in regard of their remainder of sin and lust that is in them, and will be so while they are in the world, and the temptations which every where he in the world, as snares for their feet; they will have need of a daily washing by repentance, and fresh applications of their souls to my blood, by the repeated exercises of faith, according to their renewed and repeated acts of sin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye are clean; </span> you, who are my apostles, are clean; you are washed, you are justified, I have forgiven your sins, accepted your persons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But not all; </span> the most of you are so, but not all. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus saith to him, he that is washed,.... Not he that is baptized; for every such person is not wholly clean, but he who is regenerated by the Spirit of God, or rather, who is washed in the blood of Christ: such an one "is clean every whit"; is all over clean; not that he has no sin in him, nor commits any; but as he is washed in the blood of Christ, and justified by his righteousness, he is wholly and entirely clean in the sight of God; for he is justified from all things he could not be justified from by the law of Moses; all his sins are pardoned, and he is perfectly righteous before God; and so is perfectly clean through the word or sentence of justification and absolution pronounced on him, which must be understood in a forensic or law sense. And such an one <p>needeth not, save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit; the feet of his life and conversation, which are continually gathering dirt, and need daily washing in the blood of Christ; and therefore recourse must be constantly had to that fountain to wash in, for sin and for uncleanness. The allusion is either to persons washed all over in a bath, who have no need to wash again, unless their feet, which may contract some soil in coming out of it; or to travellers, who have often need to wash their feet, though no other part, and such is the case of the children of God in this life; or rather to the priests, who having bathed themselves in the morning, needed not to wash again all the day, except their hands and feet, on certain occasions (x). <p>And ye are clean, but not all; which shows, that justifying and regenerating grace are common to all the true disciples of Christ; they are equally born again, alike justified, and are as clean one as an other in the sight of God; not only Peter, but all the apostles, were clean, excepting one; there was one of them, Judas, who was not clean; and therefore he says, but not all: whence it may be observed, that among the purest societies, there are some unclean persons; there was a Judas, an unclean person among the pure disciples of Christ; there are chaff and tares among his wheat, goats among his sheep, and foolish virgins along with the wise ones. <p>(x) Misn.

Jesus sets the disciple right, and that by proceeding to speak of the washing in question according to the spiritual sense of which it is to be taken as the symbol, in order thereby to lead the disciple, who had misunderstood Him, to the true comprehension of the matter. According to the mere verbal sense, He says: “<span class="ital">He who has bathed needs nothing further than to wash his feet</span> (which have been soiled again by the road); <span class="ital">rather is he</span> (except as to this necessary cleansing of the feet) <span class="ital">clean in his entire body</span>.” But this statement, derived from experience of the sensuous province of life, serves as a symbolical wrapping of the ethical thought which Jesus desires to set forth: “<span class="ital">He who has already experienced moral purification in general and on the whole</span> in fellowship with me, like him who has cleansed his whole body in the bath, <span class="ital">requires only to be freed from the sinful defilement in individual things which has been again contracted in the intercourse of life;</span> as one who has bathed only requires again the washing of his feet, <span class="ital">but in other respects he is clean as to his whole moral personality</span>.” This necessity of <span class="ital">individual purification</span> demanding <span class="ital">daily penitence</span>, which Jesus here sets forth in the <span class="greekheb">λελουμένος</span> by <span class="greekheb">τοὺς πόδας νίψασθαι</span>, how manifest it became in the very case of Peter! <span class="ital">E.g</span>., after he denied his Lord, and after the hypocrisy exhibited at Antioch, Galatians 2.

In the Greek we have quite a different word from the one rendered ‘wash’ elsewhere in these verses: the latter means to wash part of the body, this to bathe the whole person. A man who has bathed does not need to bathe again when he reaches home, but only to wash the dust off his feet: then he is wholly clean. So also in the spiritual life, a man whose moral nature has once been thoroughly purified need not think that this has been all undone if in the walk through life he contracts some stains: these must be washed away, and then he is once more wholly clean. Peter, conscious of his own imperfections, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-8.htm" title="When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.">Luke 5:8</a>, and possibly here, rushes to the conclusion that he is utterly unclean. But his meaning here perhaps rather is; ‘If having part in Thee depends on being washed by Thee, wash all Thou canst.’ S. Peter excellently illustrates Christ’s saying. His love for his Master proves that he had bathed; his boastfulness (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-37.htm" title="Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now?

Christ's answer here undoubtedly shows that he is speaking of something far more important than the foot-washing. He goes back to the spiritual meaning which Peter attributed to his words. <span class="cmt_word">He that has been bathed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is indeed washed from head to foot, <span class="cmt_word">hath no further need than to wash his feet</span>, <span class="cmt_word">but is altogether clean.</span> By personal communion with the Lord and belief in him, by the word which he had spoken to his disciples, they were (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>) clean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>). They had been washed from the defilement of their old nature, they had undergone a thorough moral and spiritual change, by moral union with Christ. They were reconciled and cleansed; they therefore did not need a fundamental change to be wrought daily in head, hands, and life. Just as a man who had thoroughly bathed only requires the removal of the soil contracted in the daily walk; so a regenerated and forgiven man is clean, and, like Peter, should not need, being <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, more than the foot-cleansing which Christ in Divine condescension had then granted. It was inevitable that some of the Fathers (Augustine, Theodore) and many modern expositors (Hengstenberg, Godet, and Wordsworth) should see here a reference to baptism, and speak of Peter's having overlooked the grace of his baptism. When it is remembered, however, that nothing but John's "baptism unto repentance" had been administered to the disciples, and that this cleansing is, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-3.htm">John 15:3</a>, distinctly referred to the <span class="accented">word</span> of Christ, it is a very unnecessary trifling with the text to find in this <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> baptism or any sacramental or symbolic act.

Archdeacon Farrar, 'Early Days of Christianity,' vol. 1. p. 126, suggests that this intensely interesting scene may account for Simon Peter's picturesque expression (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), wherein he enjoins on Christians to "tie on humility like a dress fastened with knots;" and also for the apostle's "insight into the true meaning of baptism, as being, not the putting away the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God." <span class="cmt_word">And ye are clean</span>; and therefore these words and this principle apply to you. Dr. Westcott finds in this phrase a reference to the purity of the <span class="accented">visible</span> Church, notwithstanding, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the presence of Judas in the group; but the exception itself which follows shows that the Lord did not regard Judas as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The suggestion of the passage is precisely contrary to that so often drawn. <span class="cmt_word">But not all</span>. This reference to Judas may have been one more warning to the man who was plotting against his Master's life. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He that is washed - wash his feet (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  - &#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;).<p>The A.V. obliterates the distinction between &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;, to bathe, to apply water to the whole body, and &#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;, to wash a part of the body. Thus, when Dorcas died (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-37.htm">Acts 9:37</a>) they bathed her body (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;). The proverb in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>, is about the sow that has been bathed all over (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;). On the other hand, he who fasts must wash (&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) his face (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm">Matthew 6:17</a>). Both verbs are always used of living beings in the New Testament. The word for washing things, as nets, garments, etc., is &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-2.htm">Luke 5:2</a>. All three verbs occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-11.htm">Leviticus 15:11</a> (Sept.). </body></html>
