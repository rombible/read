The present words are a free rendering of the Greek (LXX.) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm" title="Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.">Psalm 41:9</a>; but the LXX. follow the Hebrew more literally, and read, “hath made great his heel.” This is here interpreted to mean, “lifted up his heel,” which the Bible version of the Psalm gives, with the literal rendering <span class= "ital">magnified</span> in the margin. The Prayer Book version follows the Vulgate in reading “hath laid great wait for Me.”<p>Our Lord’s quotation omits the earlier part of the verse, “Mine own familiar friend whom I trusted.” He knew whom He had chosen. “He knew what was in man, and did not trust Himself to them” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/2-24.htm" title="But Jesus did not commit himself to them, because he knew all men,">John 2:24-25</a>).<p>It is by no means certain that we are justified in following the title of the Psalm, and ascribing it to David. It is not improbable that here, as in Psalms 69, we have the words of Jeremiah, and the special reference to the friend is unknown. If the Psalm was by David, then, as the king was the type of Christ, Ahithophel is doubtless the type of Judas. In any case the baseness of the treachery lay in the fact that the betrayer was one who did eat bread with the psalmist. He was, as our word expresses it, a “companion” (one who breaks bread with), but to this the Orientals attached a sacredness which even the Bedouin of the desert would honour. But there was one then professing to be His Apostle, eating bread with Him, and yet planning to betray Him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:18-30 Our Lord had often spoken of his own sufferings and death, without such trouble of spirit as he now discovered when he spake of Judas. The sins of Christians are the grief of Christ. We are not to confine our attention to Judas. The prophecy of his treachery may apply to all who partake of God's mercies, and meet them with ingratitude. See the infidel, who only looks at the Scriptures with a desire to do away their authority and destroy their influence; the hypocrite, who professes to believe the Scriptures, but will not govern himself by them; and the apostate, who turns aside from Christ for a thing of naught. Thus mankind, supported by God's providence, after eating bread with Him, lift up the heel against Him! Judas went out as one weary of Jesus and his apostles. Those whose deeds are evil, love darkness rather than light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I speak not of you all - That is, in addressing you as clean, I do not mean to say that you all possess this character.<p>I know whom I have chosen - He here means evidently to say that he had not chosen them all, implying that Judas had not been chosen. As, however, this word is applied to Judas in one place <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-70.htm">John 6:70</a>, "Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?" it must have a different meaning here from that which it has there. There it evidently refers to the apostleship. Jesus had chosen him to be an apostle, and had treated him as such. Here it refers to purity of heart, and Jesus implies that, though Judas had been chosen to the office of apostleship, yet he had not been chosen to purity of heart and life. The remaining eleven had been, and would be saved. It was not, however, the fault of Jesus that Judas was not saved, for he was admitted to the same teaching, the same familiarity, and the same office; but his execrable love of gold gained the ascendency, and rendered vain all the means used for his conversion.<p>But that the scripture ... - These things have occurred in order that the prophecies may receive their completion. It does not mean that Judas was compelled to this course in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, but that this was foretold, and that by this the prophecy did receive a completion. "The scripture." This is written in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>. It is commonly understood of Ahithophel, and of the enemies of David who had been admitted to his friendship, and who had now proved ungrateful to him.<p>May be fulfilled - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22</a>. It is difficult to tell whether this prophecy had a primary reference to Judas, or whether it be meant that it received a more complete fulfillment in his case than in the time of David. The cases were similar; the same words would describe both events, for there was an exhibition of similar ingratitude and baseness in both cases, so that the same words would fitly describe both events.<p>He that eateth bread with me - To eat with one was a proof of friendship. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-11.htm">2 Samuel 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-11.htm">Matthew 9:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-32.htm">Genesis 43:32</a>. This means that Judas had been admitted to all the privileges of friendship, and had partaken of the usual evidences of affection. It was this which greatly aggravated his offence. It was base ingratitude as well as murder.<p>Hath lifted up his heel - Suidas says that this figure is taken from those who are running in a race, when one attempts to trip the other up and make him fall. It was a base and ungrateful return for kindness to which the Lord Jesus referred, and it means that he who had been admitted to the intimacies of friendship had ungratefully and maliciously injured him. Some suppose the expression means to lay snares for one others, to kick or injure a man after he is cast down (Calvin on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>). It is clear that it denotes great injury, and injury aggravated by the fact of professed friendship. It was not merely the common people, the open enemies, the Jewish nation that did it, but one who had received all the usual proofs of kindness. It was this which greatly aggravated our Saviour's sufferings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18, 19.

(Compare Heb 10:29). In the Psalm the immediate reference is to Ahithophel's treachery against David (2Sa 17:1-23), one of those scenes in which the parallel of his story with that of His great Antitype is exceedingly striking. "The eating bread derives a fearful meaning from the participation in the sacramental supper, a meaning which must be applied for ever to all unworthy communicants, as well as to all betrayers of Christ who eat the bread of His Church" (Stier, with whom, and others, we agree in thinking that Judas partook of the Lord's Supper).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I am about to tell you what will make your ears tingle; but be of good comfort, what I shall now tell you doth not concern all of you, it concerneth but one man amongst you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I know whom I have chosen</span> to the work of the apostleship; so some interpret it, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-70.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?">John 6:70</a></span>, <span class="ital">Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</span> But the generality of the best interpreters understand the choosing here mentioned, of a choosing to eternal life, and perseverance in the way of God as a means in order to it, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a></span>; and so understood, here is a greater argument in this text to prove the Godhead of Christ, as the Author of eternal election: Though one of you be a devil, a traitor, yet I have chosen the rest of you to eternal life: and this is no more than was prophesied of me, and fulfilled in David as a type of me: the Scripture must have its accomplishment; that Scripture is now fulfilled in me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I speak not of you all.

The passage is by many interpreted either of Ahithophel, or of some other counsellor of Absalom's, or of Absalom himself; and is applied to their conduct, with respect to David, at the time of their rebellion against him; and which is thought to be typical of the treatment Christ met with from an apostle of his: but we do not find that, at the time of that rebellion, David was sick, or had any disease upon him, from whence they might hope for his death; it does not seem, as though it could be literally understood of David at all, and of the behaviour of any of his servants; but most properly of David's son, the Messiah, Jesus, with whom everything in the psalm agrees; and particularly this verse, which so plainly describes Judas, and expresses his base ingratitude, hypocrisy, and malice: the former part of the text is not cited, "yea, mine own familiar friend", or "the man of my peace, in whom I trusted"; though it fully agrees with him, he being admitted to great familiarity with Christ, and lived peaceably with him; and who was intrusted by him with the bag, into which the money was put, which was ministered, either for the sustenance of him and his apostles, or for the use of the poor: but our Lord thought fit to cite no more of it than what follows, that being sufficiently descriptive of him; and especially at this present time, when he was at table with his Lord. <p>He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel against me; he sat down with him at table frequently, and ate bread with him; and was doing so, when Satan put it into his heart to betray him; which is strongly expressed, by "lifting up" his "heel against him"; and sets forth the ingratitude, wickedness, and cruelty of him; who, like an unruly horse, that has thrown his rider, spurns at him, to destroy him; and also the insidious manner in which he did it; he supplanted, he tripped him, as wrestlers do, in order to cast him down to the ground, and then trample upon him, and triumph over him: he first  "laid snares for him", as Jarchi explains the phrase used in the "psalm", and then  "he magnified his heel", he behaved proudly and haughtily to him. <p>(b) See my Book of the Prophecies of the Messiah, &amp;c. p. 168, &amp;c. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.</span><p>(2) The betraying of Christ was not accidental, or a thing that happened by chance, but it was the Father who ordained the cause of our salvation, to reconcile us unto himself in his Son, and the Son willingly and voluntarily obeyed the Father.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me....">John 13:18-19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐ περὶ πάντ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν λέγω</span>] Namely, this that ye <span class="greekheb">μακάριοι ἐστε</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. “Est inter vos, qui non erit beatus neque faciet ea,” Augustine.

The quotation is taken, but with freedom, from the Hebrew of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm" title="Yes, my own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.">Psalm 41:9</a>; for ‘lifted up his heel’ both the Hebrew and the LXX. have ‘magnified his heel.’ (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-45.htm" title="It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes to me.">John 6:45</a>.) The metaphor here is of one raising his foot before kicking, but the blow is not yet given. This was the attitude of Judas at this moment. It has been remarked that Christ omits the words ‘Mine own familiar friend whom I trusted:’ He had not trusted Judas, and had not been deceived, as the Psalmist had been: ‘He knew what was in man’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-25.htm" title="And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.">John 2:25</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">He that eateth bread with me</span>] Or, <span class="ital">He that eateth</span> <span class="bld">the</span> <span class="ital">bread with Me</span>. The more probable reading gives, <span class="bld">My bread</span> for ‘the bread with Me.’ The variations from the LXX. are remarkable. (1) The word for ‘eat’ is changed from the common verb (<span class="greekheb">ἐσθίω</span>) used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-10.htm" title="But you, O LORD, be merciful to me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.">Psalm 41:10</a> to the much less common verb (<span class="greekheb">τρώγω</span>) used of eating Christ’s Flesh and the Bread from Heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-54.htm" title="Whoever eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-56.htm" title="He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him....">John 6:56-58</a>, where see notes), and nowhere else in the N.T., excepting <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-38.htm" title="For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,">Matthew 24:38</a>. (2) ‘Bread’ or ‘loaves’ (<span class="greekheb">ἄρτους</span>) has been altered to ‘<span class="ital">the</span> bread’ (<span class="greekheb">τὸν ἄρτον</span>). (3) ‘My’ has possibly been strengthened to ‘with Me:’ to eat bread with a man is more than to eat his bread, which a servant might do. These changes can scarcely be accidental, and seem to point to the fact that the treachery of Judas in violating the bond of hospitality, so universally held sacred in the East, was aggravated by his having partaken of the Eucharist. That Judas did partake of the Eucharist seems to follow from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/22-19.htm" title="And he took bread, and gave thanks, and broke it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me....">Luke 22:19-21</a>, but the point is one about which there is much controversy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>S.

This paragraph draws the circle of his cleansed ones, of those who accept him as Master and Lord in the fullest sense, more closely (at) out him.

Emphasis must be laid upon the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It refers to Christ's choice of apostles, not to the eternal election to salvation. This interpretation corresponds more closely with the text, though it savors of a fatalism foreign to the Scripture. There is, however, a true sense in which the evil-disposed man is so placed that, if he will sin, he must sin along certain well-defined lines. The forty-first psalm, from which the quotation is made, is not strictly Messianic; it is descriptive of the ideal Sufferer, the holy but outraged man, whose melancholy condition is sure to be characterized by treachery among his familiar friends. Christ implies that, if he were to fulfill this portraiture, then this bitter dreg would be put into his cup; and so he humanly made this choice, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he took steps which in their tenderness of love might have saved Judas from the worst, but which were really part of a Divine plan which would vindicate his own foresight and the method of Divine government. A full understanding of the formula in Matthew and John, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc0;&#x1fbe;</span>, will save us from putting into these words a hopeless fatalism. Notice that the LXX. reads this passage differently, and is not so closely allied to the Hebrew: "He that eateth my leaves hath magnified against me his surreptitious despite, his tricky antagonism." Great beauty is given to the passage by the R.T. <span class="accented">you</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, for it suggests the idea that Christ was the real Host of the twelve, the Father and Provider of his family. Christ must be regarded as the Father and Host of the entire group of guests, and the treacherous treatment of a host throughout the East is regarded as a sign of peculiar obduracy. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I have chosen (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)<p>Aorist tense, I chose.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-54.htm">John 6:54</a>. Originally it means to gnaw or crunch; to chew raw vegetables or fruits, and hence often used of animals feeding, as Homer ("Odyssey," vi., 90), of mules feeding. Of course it has lost its original sense in the New Testament, as it did to some extent in classical Greek, though, as applied to men, it more commonly referred to eating vegetables or fruit, as Aristophanes ("Peace," 1325) &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, to eat figs. The entire divorce in the New Testament from its primitive sense is shown in its application to the flesh of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-54.htm">John 6:54</a>). It is used by John only in connection with Christ.<p>Bread with me (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;' &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Some editors read, &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, my bread.<p>Heel (&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here in the New Testament. The metaphor is of one administering a kick. Thus Plutarch, describing the robber Sciron, who was accustomed "out of insolence and wantonness to stretch forth his feet to strangers, commanding them to wash them, and then, when they did it, with a kick to send them down the rock into the sea" ("Theseus"). Some have explained the metaphor by the tripping up of one's feet in wrestling; but, as Meyer justly says, "Jesus was not overreached." The quotation is from the Hebrew, not the Septuagint of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> (Sept. 40). The Septuagint reads, "For the man of my peace in whom I hoped, who eateth my bread, magnified his cunning (&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, literally, tripping up) against me." </body></html>
