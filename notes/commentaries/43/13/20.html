They are to go forth, then, and to be content if their path is as that which their Master has trodden. They are not to be disheartened by treachery even in their midst, for this He had foreseen. The words spoken when they were called to be Apostles still hold true. Their honour and encouragement is in the fact that <span class= "ital">they</span> are Apostles from Him, as He is an Apostle from the Father. This truth is one of those solemn utterances on which He would have them dwell, and is therefore introduced by “Verily, verily.” (Comp.

The sins of Christians are the grief of Christ. We are not to confine our attention to Judas. The prophecy of his treachery may apply to all who partake of God's mercies, and meet them with ingratitude. See the infidel, who only looks at the Scriptures with a desire to do away their authority and destroy their influence; the hypocrite, who professes to believe the Scriptures, but will not govern himself by them; and the apostate, who turns aside from Christ for a thing of naught. Thus mankind, supported by God's providence, after eating bread with Him, lift up the heel against Him! Judas went out as one weary of Jesus and his apostles. Those whose deeds are evil, love darkness rather than light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that receiveth ... - This sentiment is found in the instructions which Jesus gave to his disciples in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-40.htm">Matthew 10:40</a>. Why he repeats it at this time cannot now be known. It is certain that it is not closely connected with the subject of his conversation. Perhaps, however, it was to show how intimately united he, his Father, his apostles, and all who received them were. They who received them received him, and they who received him received God. So he who betrayed him, betrayed, for the same reason, God. Hence Judas, who was about to betray him, was also about to betray the cause of religion in the world, and to betray God and his cause. Everything pertaining to religion is connected together. A man cannot do dishonor to one of the institutions of religion without injuring all; he cannot dishonor its ministers or the Saviour without dishonoring God. And this shows that one prominent ground of the Saviour's solicitude was that his Father might be honored, and one source of his deep grief at the treason of Judas was that it would bring injury upon the whole cause of religion in the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. He that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me, &c.&#8212;(See on [1846]Mt 10:40). The connection here seems to be that despite the dishonor done to Him by Judas, and similar treatment awaiting themselves, they were to be cheered by the assurance that their office, even as His own, was divine.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-24.htm" title="The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.">Matthew 10:24</a>"</span>, the words of which place are but here repeated; either to commend to them brotherly love, and offices of love, which he had before recommended to them under the notion of washing one another’s feet; or else to comfort his disciples, who might think that this treacherous villany of Judas would make them odious to the whole world: No, saith our Saviour, you are my messengers, persons sent by me; I will provide for you, there shall be those who will receive you. And I declare to all the world to encourage them, that I shall take their receiving of you as kindly as if they received me, and it shall turn to the same account, and that is all one as if they had received my Father himself, for he sent me. Some think that by these words Christ aggravates the sin of Judas, as being committed against the Father as well as against Christ; and a most treacherous failure as to the duty of an apostle, or one dignified so much as to be sent out by Christ. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Verily, verily, I say unto you,....

And for the furtherance and confirmation of this your fidelity in the faith, which, in spite of the treason arising from your midst, must not vacillate, I say to you, that ye may confidently go forward to meet your calling as my ambassadors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.">John 20:21</a>). The <span class="ital">high and blessed position</span> of my ambassadors remains so unimpaired, that whoever accepts <span class="ital">them</span> accepts <span class="ital">me</span>, etc. The more, however, that Jesus could not but apprehend a disheartening impression from the treason on the rest of the disciples, the more earnestly (<span class="greekheb">ἀμὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀμὴν λέγω ὑμ</span>.) does He introduce this encouragement. Comp. Calvin: Christ would “<span class="ital">offendiculo mederi</span>;” and Grotius: “ostendit ministeria ipsis injuncta <span class="ital">non caritura suis solatiis</span>.” The antithesis of the treason to the dignity of the apostolic circle (Hilgenfeld) He certainly does not mean to assert, so self-evident was this antithesis. But neither do the words serve to confirm the <span class="greekheb">πιστεύσ</span>., <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι</span> (Ebrard); to this the first half of the verse is not appropriate, in which, indeed, Godet, without any justification, would wish to give to the simple <span class="greekheb">ἐάν τινα</span> the limiting sense: He among you, who is <span class="ital">really</span> my ambassador. Further: to join <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-20.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.">John 13:20</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-16.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him....">John 13:16-17</a> (Lampe, Storr, Klee, Maier, Hengstenberg, comp. Brückner) is an arbitrary construction, which Kuinoel aggravates by explaining the words as a <span class="ital">gloss</span> from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-40.htm" title="He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me.">Matthew 10:40</a>, added to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-16.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.">John 13:16</a>, and which subsequently entered the text in the wrong place, as Lücke also has revived the suspicion of a gloss (from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-48.htm" title="And said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in my name receives me: and whoever shall receive me receives him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.">Luke 9:48</a>). The absence of connection, employed by Strauss as an argument against the originality, is external, but not in the sequence of the thought itself; and besides, the emotion and agitation of Jesus are here to be taken into consideration. Only in view of the manifest identity of the saying with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-40.htm" title="He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me.">Matthew 10:40</a>, we are not to explain it in an essentially different sense (Luthardt explains of the sending of those needing the ministry of love to the disciples). But to drag in here the dispute about rank, which <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-24.htm" title="And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.">Luke 22:24</a> ff. places <span class="ital">after</span> the supper (Baeumlein), is groundless, and of no use in the way of explanation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> NOTE.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The story of the feet-washing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end....">John 13:1-20</a>,—after 13 retschneider, Fritzsche, and Strauss had rejected it as a mythical invention, whilst Weisse had recognised only individual portions in it as genuine,—has been justly defended by Schweizer, p. 164 ff., in conformity with its stamp of truth and originality, which throughout indicates the eye-witness; in opposition to which, Baur can only recognise a free formation out of synoptical material (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/13-2.htm" title="And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;...">John 13:2-5</a>) in the service of the idea, as also Hilgenfeld, comp. Scholten. The non-mention of the occurrence in the Synoptics is explained from the fact that with them the situation is quite different, and the main point is the institution of the Supper.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-20.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.">John 13:20</a>. But lest this announcement should weaken their confidence in one another and in their own call to the Apostolate (“probabile est voluisse Christum offendiculo mederi”. Calvin) He hastens to add: <span class="greekheb">ἀμὴν</span> … <span class="greekheb">πέμψαντά με</span> [<span class="greekheb">ἄν τινα</span> better than <span class="greekheb">ἐάν τινα</span>].

The saying is one with which Christ had sent forth the Apostles in the first instance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-40.htm" title="He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me.">Matthew 10:40</a>). It is recalled at the moment when one of them is being denounced for treachery. It was natural that such an end to such a mission should send Christ’s thoughts back to the beginning of it. Moreover He would warn them all from supposing that such a catastrophe either cancelled the mission or proved it to be worthless from the first. Of every one of them, even of Judas himself, the saying still held good, ‘he that receiveth <span class="ital">whomsoever</span> I send, receiveth Me.’ The unworthiness of the minister cannot annul the commission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-20.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.">John 13:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀμὴν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀμήν</span>, <span class="ital">verily, verily</span>) Jesus, after having imbued His disciples, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.">John 13:1</a> and following verses, with His own disposition, and His own purity, with a view to their sanctification, now also graces them with His own authority.

The words reveal a claim to issue such commissions, and to confer upon his apostolic and other representatives something of his <span class="accented">own</span> dignity and glory, viz. the glory of sacrifice far others, the dignity of service. He may have intended: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> To comfort those who are bewildered by the thought of the treachery within their enclosure, and to assure them that such conduct on the part of an apostle must not be allowed to lower their estimate of apostolic duty. Certain ecclesiastical interpreters find here that the unworthiness even of Judas did not destroy the Divine character of his testimony, and that the immoral character of the minister now does not annul the commission he has received. This dogma is essentially hostile to the teaching of the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17-21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The royal power of the dying Christ; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the bold identification of his own claims with those of his Father. Few more wonderful sayings were uttered by Jesus, if we ponder the connection in which they stand; but let it be observed that we do <span class="accented">not</span> owe to the Fourth Gospel the <span class="accented">matter</span> of this saying. It must have been familiar to the readers of John from the solemn records of the Gospel of Matthew. </body></html>
