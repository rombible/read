Each leaned on his left arm, leaving the right arm free. The feet were stretched out behind the guest on his right hand, and the back of the head reached near to the bosom of the guest on the left. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-25.htm" title="He then lying on Jesus' breast said to him, Lord, who is it?">John 13:25</a>.) The Jews followed this Persian method of reclining on couches at meals from the time of the Captivity, and this method of eating the Passover had the special significance of security and possession of the Promised Land, as opposed to the attitude of one undertaking a journey, which was part of the original institution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-11.htm" title="And thus shall you eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.">Exodus 12:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> John himself.

The sins of Christians are the grief of Christ. We are not to confine our attention to Judas. The prophecy of his treachery may apply to all who partake of God's mercies, and meet them with ingratitude. See the infidel, who only looks at the Scriptures with a desire to do away their authority and destroy their influence; the hypocrite, who professes to believe the Scriptures, but will not govern himself by them; and the apostate, who turns aside from Christ for a thing of naught. Thus mankind, supported by God's providence, after eating bread with Him, lift up the heel against Him! Judas went out as one weary of Jesus and his apostles.

See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-6.htm">Matthew 23:6</a>.<p>Whom Jesus loved - This was doubtless John himself. The evangelists are not accustomed to mention their own names when any mark of favor or any good deed is recorded. They did not seek publicity or notoriety. In this case the appellation is more tender and honorable than any mere name. John was admitted to special friendship, perhaps, because the natural disposition of our Saviour was more nearly like the amiableness and mildness of John than any of the other disciples (Robert Hall). The highest honor that can be conferred on any man is to say that Jesus loved him. Yet this is an honor which all may possess, but which none can inherit without his spirit and without loving him. It is an honor which cannot be won by wealth or learning, by beauty or accomplishments, by rank or earthly honors, but only by the possession of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23-26. there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved&#8212;Thus modestly does our Evangelist denote himself, as reclining next to Jesus at the table.<p>Peter &#8230; beckoned to him to ask who it should be of whom he spake&#8212;reclining probably at the corresponding place on the other side of Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This <span class="bld">leaning on Jesus’ bosom, </span> and the <span class="ital">laying on Jesus’ breast, </span> mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-25.htm" title="He then lying on Jesus' breast said to him, Lord, who is it?">John 13:25</a></span>, cannot be understood without the understanding of the usual posture the Jews used at their meals, and particularly at the paschal supper; of which we have spoken largely; <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-20.htm" title="Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.">Matthew 26:20</a>"</span>: see the annotations there. Their posture seemeth to have been kneeling, and resting their bodies back upon their legs, with a leaning upon their left elbow; and this seemeth not to have been so close, but that he that so sat might use his other hand to take his meat; hence he who sat before any, sat with his back towards him, but leaning towards the bosom of the other, which is here called a leaning on (that is, towards) his bosom, and laying on his breast; for it cannot be understood of such a sitting, or leaning, as to touch the other’s breast or bosom, for that would have hindered him upon whom the person so leaned from any use of his right hand to take his meat or drink. It is apparent from hence, first, that at this supper there was none but Christ and his disciples. Secondly, that they sat in this posture of leaning. These two things make it very probable, if not certain, that the supper here mentioned was either the paschal supper, or a common supper, which immediately went before, or followed after, the passover supper. For, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. We have no record of any other supper, at which were only Christ and the twelve disciples; and: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. If we may believe the Jewish writers, though their ordinary posture at their common meals was discumbency, that is a kneeling on their knees, with a resting their bodies backward upon their legs; yet this posture of leaning was constantly added only upon the passover night, as a further testimony of their liberty, that they were not now servants, as in the land of Egypt.

Not pressing upon that part of Christ's body, which would have been irreverent in John, and troublesome to Christ; but leaning at table upon his bed or couch, on which he lay; and which was next to, and just before Christ; so that he was very near unto, and seemed to lie in the bosom of Christ; as such are said to do, who sit next at table to another. The posture of the Jews at table, was either "sitting" or "lying", and a difference they make between these two; <p>"if, say they (d), , "they sat" to eat everyone asked a blessing for himself; but if  "they lay down", one asked a blessing for them all.'' <p>This lying down was not on their backs, nor on their right side, but on their left; for they say (e), that <p>"lying down on the back, is not called  "lying down"; and lying on the right side, is not called lying down.'' <p>And the reason given is (f), because they have need of the right hand to eat with; but as they elsewhere (g) observe, <p>"they used to eat lying along, leaning on the left side, their feet to the ground, and every man on a single couch.'' <p>Would you know the order in which they, lay, take the account as they have given it (h); <p>"when there were but two couches, the principal person lay first, and the second to him above him; and when there were three, the principal person lay in the middle, the second to him above him, and the third below him; and if he would talk with him, he raised himself upright, and sitting upright he talked with him; that is, as the gloss explains it, if the principal person was desirous to talk with him that was second to him, he must raise himself up from his lying down, and sit upright; for all the white he is leaning, he cannot talk with him, because he that is second to him, is behind the head of the principal person, and the face of the principal person is turned to the other side; and it is better for the second to sit below him, that he may hear his words, whilst he is leaning.'' <p>The form in which Christ and his disciples sat or lay at table, we may conceive was this (i); a table was placed in the middle and as many beds or couches round it, as there were persons; Christ the principal and most worthy person lay first, with his head toward the table, his face somewhat turned from it, leaning on his left elbow upon the couch; in this posture lay Jesus, upon the first couch; in the same posture lay John, in the next to him, and just before him; the hinder part of his head being towards, and near the breast and bosom of Jesus; whence he is said to lean upon it: now to lie next to the principal person, was a very great honour, as well as a mark of great affection; and for John to lie next to Jesus, and as it were to lean on his bosom, showed how much he was respected and honoured by him; and therefore John modestly conceals his name, and only says, <p>one of his disciples whom Jesus loved; Christ, as the Son of God, and surety of his people, loved his true disciples, as he does all his elect, alike; not one more than the other; but as man, he had a particular affection for this disciple, and therefore admitted him near his person, and was very familiar with him. <p>(d) Misn.

There is, however, in this passage, a designation [intimation by description] of the proper name itself (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-11.htm" title="For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.">Luke 2:11</a>, notes; the name <span class="ital">Jesus</span> not being given, but its equivalent force being represented by the term <span class="ital">Saviour</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-4.htm" title="John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be to you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;">Revelation 1:4</a>, “Him which is, and which was, and which is to come,” a periphrasis for the Tetragram of Jehovah, <span class="greekheb">יהוה</span>; add, if you please, the observations I have made in Paneg. Gregorii Thaum. p. 181); for John is designated as the one especially favoured by the grace of the Lord.[333] Accordingly this appellation is put, even where the accompanying context did not much require it: for instance, in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>, in connection with Peter, whose name is given. Moreover here, when Jesus’ passion was at hand, the first remarkable intimation of <span class="ital">His love</span> was given to John, through the revelation to him of the secret [<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-20.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.">John 13:20</a>]; previously he seems not to have known that he was so dear to Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[333] This is the meaning of the Hebrew name <span class="ital">John</span>.—E. and T.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Was leaning on Jesus' bosom (&#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>The Rev. renders, "there was at the table reclining," etc. At the table is added because the verb is the general term equivalent to sitting at table. "In Jesus' bosom," defines John's position relatively to the other guests. As the guests reclined upon the left arm, the feet being stretched out behind, the head of each would be near the breast of his companion on the left. Supposing that Jesus, Peter, and John were together, Jesus would occupy the central place, the place of honor, and John, being in front of Him, could readily lean back and speak to Him. Peter would be behind him.<p>Bosom<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>. The Synoptists do not give this incident.</body></html>
