The words are here addressed to Jews, for there is no reason to think that the nobleman himself was not one. They are spoken to him, but the <span class= "ital">ye</span> extends them to others standing near and to the class of persons whom he represents. It had been so with the Jews in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-18.htm" title="Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign show you to us, seeing that you do these things?">John 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>), and it was so with the Jews in Galilee. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:">1Corinthians 1:22</a>.) How different from this faith, which demanded a miracle, and therefore was not faith, but sight, was the acceptance by the Samaritans without a miracle, who believed for the woman’s word, and more fully when they heard the word of Christ Himself.<p><span class= "bld">Ye will not believe.</span>—The negative is in its strongest form, <span class= "ital">Ye will by no means believe.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:43-54 The father was a nobleman, yet the son was sick. Honours and titles are no security from sickness and death. The greatest men must go themselves to God, must become beggars. The nobleman did not stop from his request till he prevailed. But at first he discovered the weakness of his faith in the power of Christ. It is hard to persuade ourselves that distance of time and place, are no hinderance to the knowledge, mercy, and power of our Lord Jesus. Christ gave an answer of peace. Christ's saying that the soul lives, makes it alive. The father went his way, which showed the sincerity of his faith. Being satisfied, he did not hurry home that night, but returned as one easy in his own mind. His servants met him with the news of the child's recovery. Good news will meet those that hope in God's word. Diligent comparing the works of Jesus with his word, will confirm our faith. And the bringing the cure to the family brought salvation to it. Thus an experience of the power of one word of Christ, may settle the authority of Christ in the soul. The whole family believed likewise. The miracle made Jesus dear to them. The knowledge of Christ still spreads through families, and men find health and salvation to their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Except ye see signs ... - This was spoken not to the nobleman only, but to the Galileans generally. The Samaritans had believed without any miracle. The Galileans, he said, were less disposed to believe him than even they were; and though he had performed miracles enough to convince them, yet, unless they continually saw them, they would not believe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>48-54. Except ye see signs, &c.&#8212;He did believe, both as his coming and his urgent entreaty show; but how imperfectly we shall see; and our Lord would deepen his faith by such a blunt and seemingly rough answer as He made to Nicodemus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It may seem strange to such as do not well weigh all circumstances, that our Saviour, who at other times went without asking, showed himself so hard to be entreated by this courtier, and answereth him so roughly; but we must not take ourselves to be able to give a certain account of all Christ’s actions, and different dealings with persons, whose hearts he well enough knew. Thus much is certain, that our Saviour always preferred that faith which was given to his bare word, before that which waited for a miracle confirmative of that word, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-29.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.">John 20:29</a></span>. Our Saviour saw that this courtier came to him purely upon a natural account, for the recovery of his dying son, without a desire to be instructed in his heavenly doctrine; therefore (as it may be presumed) he checks this courtier; and not him alone, but the generality of the Jews, who were only struck with admiration of his works, and drawn from curiosity, or some temporal benefit, to follow him, without a due regard of his person, or the heavenly, saving truths preached by him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said Jesus unto him,.... With some degree of roughness in his speech, and severity in his countenance, in a way of reproof for his unbelief, as if he could not heal his son without going down to Capernaum along with him: <p>except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe. This was the cast of the Jews every where, both in Judea and Galilee; they required signs and miracles to be wrought, in confirmation of Christ's being the Messiah, and which indeed was but right; and Christ did perform them for that purpose: but their sin of unbelief lay in this, that they wanted still more and more signs; they could not be contented with what they had seen, but required more, being sluggish and backward to believe. Our Lord seems to say this chiefly for the sake of the Galilaeans, that were about him; who, though they might be acquainted with his former miracles, when among them, of turning water into wine, and had seen his wondrous works at the feast at Jerusalem, yet were very desirous of seeing more, and perhaps very pressing for this cure. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">48</span>. <span class="ital">signs and wonders</span>] Christ’s miracles are never mere ‘wonders’ to excite astonishment; they are ‘signs’ of heavenly truths as well, and this is their primary characteristic. Where these two words are joined together ‘signs’ always precedes, excepting four passages in the Acts, where we nave ‘wonders and signs.’ This is the only passage in which S. John uses ‘wonders’ at all. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a> the word translated ‘miracles’ is the same as the one here translated ‘signs.’ See below, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-54.htm" title="This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.">John 4:54</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye will not believe</span>] In marked contrast to the ready belief of the Samaritans. The form of negation in the Greek is of the strong kind; <span class="ital">ye will in no wise believe</span>. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-22.htm" title="For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>. Faith based on miracles is of a low type comparatively, but Christ does not reject it. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-38.htm" title="But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works: that you may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.">John 10:38</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-11.htm" title="Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.">John 14:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-29.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.">John 20:29</a>. This man’s faith is strengthened by being put to test.

This is marked by the use of the second person plural. But at the same time a miracle is promised, and faith is also first required on the nobleman’s part; and whilst it is being required, it is awakened by Jesus: comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-37.htm" title="If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.">John 10:37</a>, “If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not.” The reply, compounded of a kind of outward appearance of repulse, and a tacit promise of aid, is in consonance with the feeling of the suppliant, compounded as it was of faith and weakness.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said Jesus to him</span> - as representing the whole class whose faith rested upon, and was nourished, by, the outward sign, with a certain amount of reproof if not of irony in the strength of his phrase - <span class="cmt_word">Except ye see</span> (there is no special emphasis laid on the <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, as distinct from the mere report or testimony of such things) <span class="cmt_word">signs and wonders, ye will by no means believe.</span> This is the only occasion in John's Gospel where these two terms are conjoined. They are frequently brought together in Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22, 43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-30.htm">Acts 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-12.htm">Acts 5:12</a>, etc.), and used in conjunction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm">Romans 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>. John ordinarily uses (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;</span>) "works" to denote those objective tangible facts which were "signs" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Lord's higher nature and claims. Here <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, a word meaning "portents," remarkable, inexplicable events out of the common order, accompanies "signs," to complete the notion. The craving for "signs and wonders" did absorb the higher life of Judaism. "The Jews require a sign" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>), and minds that are yet in the Jewish stage of partial discipline, for spiritual revelation, still do the same. There is still in many of us the weak faith which needs the stimulating diet of the "sign" before there is any full recognition of the Divine fulness of blessing. Christ does not condemn, though he mourns over, this spiritual babyhood; and while he says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-38.htm">John 10:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-11.htm">John 14:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-24.htm">John 15:24</a>) that belief for the works' sake may lead up to true faith, yet the language addressed to Thomas, "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed," reveals his deepest thought of their comparative worth. The demand for "signs and wonders" in Galilee contrasts with the ready reception which the Samaritans had given to his <span class="accented">word.</span> Many of the difficulties of these narratives arise from the obvious fact that they are so closely compressed. Weiss has a hard task to make what he calls this "harsh answer" tally with Matthew's account of the reception of the centurion, and of the "great faith" which in his case preceded the miracle. A single sentence in the urgent request of the nobleman, implying that at Capernaum they needed the same kind of proof that had been given at Jerusalem of the Lord's prophetic claims, would account for all the emphasis laid upon the inperfect faith of the Galilaeans. He who "knew what was in man" knew in what way to rouse in this suppliant an adequate recognition of the Divine in himself. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Said unto him, Except ye see<p>Addressing the nobleman (him), but having in mind the Galilean population which he represents (ye).<p>Signs and wonders (&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>. &#x3a3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;, signs, and &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;, works, are John's characteristic words for miracles.
