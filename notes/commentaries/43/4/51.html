Now faith would be strong, and now almost give way; but he travels on with the words, “Thy son liveth,” which had come to him as a voice from heaven, sustaining and cheering him. Again he hears the same words, “Thy son liveth!” but they are spoken by the servants, who have come to meet him, and bring from Capernaum the glad news that he had himself heard at Cana.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:43-54 The father was a nobleman, yet the son was sick. Honours and titles are no security from sickness and death. The greatest men must go themselves to God, must become beggars. The nobleman did not stop from his request till he prevailed. But at first he discovered the weakness of his faith in the power of Christ. It is hard to persuade ourselves that distance of time and place, are no hinderance to the knowledge, mercy, and power of our Lord Jesus. Christ gave an answer of peace. Christ's saying that the soul lives, makes it alive. The father went his way, which showed the sincerity of his faith. Being satisfied, he did not hurry home that night, but returned as one easy in his own mind. His servants met him with the news of the child's recovery. Good news will meet those that hope in God's word. Diligent comparing the works of Jesus with his word, will confirm our faith. And the bringing the cure to the family brought salvation to it. Thus an experience of the power of one word of Christ, may settle the authority of Christ in the soul. The whole family believed likewise. The miracle made Jesus dear to them. The knowledge of Christ still spreads through families, and men find health and salvation to their souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Go thy way - This was a kind and tender address. It was designed to convince him that he could word a miracle though not personally present.<p>Thy son liveth - Thy son shall recover; or he shall be restored to health, according to thy request.<p>The man believed - The manner in which Jesus spoke it, and the assurance which he gave, convinced the man that he could heal him there as well as to go to Capernaum to do it. This is an instance of the power of Jesus to convince the mind, to soothe doubts, to confirm faith, and to meet our desires. He blesses not always in the manner in which we ask, but he grants us our main wish. The father wished his son healed by Jesus "going down" to Capernaum. Jesus healed him, but not in the way in which he asked it to be done. God will hear our prayers and grant our requests, but often not in the precise manner in which we ask it. It is his to judge of the best way of doing us good. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>50. Go thy way; thy son liveth&#8212;Both effects instantaneously followed:&#8212;"The man believed the word," and the cure, shooting quicker than lightning from Cana to Capernaum, was felt by the dying youth. In token of faith, the father takes his leave of Christ&#8212;in the circumstances this evidenced full faith. The servants hasten to convey the joyful tidings to the anxious parents, whose faith now only wants one confirmation. "When began he to amend? &#8230; Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him"&#8212;the very hour in which was uttered that great word, "Thy son liveth!" So "himself believed and his whole house." He had believed before this, first very imperfectly; then with assured confidence of Christ's word; but now with a faith crowned by "sight." And the wave rolled from the head to the members of his household. "To-day is salvation come to this house" (Lu 19:9); and no mean house this!<p>second miracle Jesus did&#8212;that is, in Cana; done "after He came out of Judea," as the former before.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The servants that met him to bring the acceptable news of his son’s recovery, knew nothing of the passages that had been betwixt Christ and their master, but merely came to tell their master what they knew would be acceptable to him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as he was now going down,....

This also seems strange to us, considering the distance from Cana to Capernaum, not exactly known to us indeed, but hardly three geographical miles. That in his firm faith he travelled “<span class="ital">non festinans</span>” (Lampe) is unnatural; the impulse of parental love would hurry him home; and so is also the idea that he <span class="ital">stayed the night</span> somewhere on the way, or at Cana (Ewald assumes the latter, making the seventh hour seven in the evening, according to the Roman reckoning).

(sunset). According to Baur and Hilgenfeld, this noting of the time is to be attributed, not to the genuineness and originality of the account, but to the subjective aim of the writer, which was to make the miracle as great and pointed as possible (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-54.htm" title="This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.">John 4:54</a>, note).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὥρᾳ</span>] <span class="ital">sc</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀφῆκεν αὐτὸν ὁ πυρετός</span>.

(Origen, Chrysostom, Theophylact, Euthymius Zigabenus, and most others). On the assumption of their <span class="ital">identity</span> (Irenaeus, Eusebius, Semler, Seyffarth, Strauss, Weisse, B. Bauer, Gfrörer, Schweizer, Ammon, Baumgarten Crusius, Baur, Hilgenfeld, Ewald, Weizsäcker), which thus attributes the greater originality on the one hand to Matthew and Luke (Strauss, B. Bauer, Weisse, Baur, Hilgenfeld), on the other to John (Gfrörer, Ewald), and to the latter an <span class="ital">adjusting</span> purpose (Weizsäcker), the discrepancies as to place, time, and even as regards the sick person, constitute lesser difficulties, as well as the entirely different character in which the suppliant appears in John and in the two Synoptics. In these latter he is still a heathen, which, according to John, he cannot be (against Cyril, Jerome, Baur, and Ewald); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-48.htm" title="Then said Jesus to him, Except you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.">John 4:48</a>, which represents him as associated with Galileans, and therefore Jews; and this alone suffices to establish the difference of the two miracles, apart from the fact that there is no more objection against the supposition of two healings wrought at a distance than against one. This is at the same time against Schweizer’s view, that the section in John is an interpolation. Indeed, a single example of healing at a distance, the historical truth of which, moreover, even Ewald maintains, might more easily be resolved by the arbitrariness of criticism into <span class="ital">a myth</span> borrowed from the history of Naaman, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-5.htm" title="And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to you, O captain.

(Strauss), or be explained away as a misunderstanding of a <span class="ital">parable</span> (Weisse), or be dissolved into a <span class="ital">subjective transposition and development of the synoptical materials</span> on John’s part for his own purpose, which would make the belief in miracles plainly pass beyond the Jewish range of view (Hilgenfeld), and appears in its highest form as a <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν διὰ τὸν λόγον</span> (Baur, p. 152);[202] although <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν τῷ λόγῳ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-41.htm" title="And many more believed because of his own word;">John 4:41</a>, is something quite different from <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν διὰ τὸν λόγον</span>, and the <span class="greekheb">ἐπίστευσεν</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-53.htm" title="So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said to him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house.">John 4:53</a> took place, not <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸν λόγον</span>, but <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸ σημεῖον</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[202] If John had really derived his matter from the Synoptics, it would be quite inconceivable how, according to the design attributed to him by Baur, he could have left unused the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-10.htm" title="When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.">Matthew 8:10</a>, especially if the <span class="greekheb">βασιλικός</span> is taken to be a Gentile.
