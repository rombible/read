And our Lord, by instructing one poor woman, here spread instruction through a whole town. Let not ministers, then, be either careless or discouraged in their preaching, because their hearers are few and mean; for by doing good to them, good may be conveyed to more, and to persons of greater influence. If believers teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, a great number may learn, and these again may teach others. Philip preached the gospel to a single person in his chariot upon the road, and he not only received it himself, but carried it into his country, and propagated it there. We see here also the good effect of speaking experimentally of Christ, and of the things of God. This woman could say little of them, but what she did say, she spake from the heart, and feelingly. Those are most likely to do good to others, who can tell what God has done for their own souls. <span class="ital">When the Samaritans were come to him </span>— Being greatly taken with the manner of his deportment, and the tenor of his discourse; <span class="ital">they besought him to tarry with them </span>— For some time at least, as being desirous of a further acquaintance with him, and of receiving further benefit from his instructions. For the meanness of his appearance, when they saw him, and the manifest poverty of his outward condition, did not lessen their esteem of him, and expectations from him. Observe, reader, we may entertain good hopes of those who have got over the vulgar prejudices that men have against true worth in a low estate. Blessed are they that are not offended in Christ at the first sight. The evangelist seems to lay an emphasis on their being Samaritans. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-33.htm" title="But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,">Luke 10:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-16.htm" title="And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.">Luke 17:16</a>. The Samaritans had not that reputation for religion that the Jews had; yet the Jews, who saw Christ’s miracles, drove him from them, while the Samaritans, who saw not his miracles, nor had shared in his favours, invited him to them! The proof of the gospel’s success is not always according to <span class="ital">probability, </span>nor what is experienced according to what is expected. <span class="ital">And he — </span>Ever ready to lay hold on every opportunity of doing good, went with them to their city; <span class="ital">and abode there two days </span>— Which was a proper medium between entirely neglecting them, and giving them so much of his time and company as would have broken in upon the design of his journey into Galilee, or might have given umbrage to the Jews.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:27-42 The disciples wondered that Christ talked thus with a Samaritan. Yet they knew it was for some good reason, and for some good end. Thus when particular difficulties occur in the word and providence of God, it is good to satisfy ourselves that all is well that Jesus Christ says and does. Two things affected the woman. The extent of his knowledge. Christ knows all the thoughts, words, and actions, of all the children of men. And the power of his word. He told her secret sins with power. She fastened upon that part of Christ's discourse, many would think she would have been most shy of repeating; but the knowledge of Christ, into which we are led by conviction of sin, is most likely to be sound and saving. They came to him: those who would know Christ, must meet him where he records his name. Our Master has left us an example, that we may learn to do the will of God as he did; with diligence, as those that make a business of it; with delight and pleasure in it. Christ compares his work to harvest-work. The harvest is appointed and looked for before it comes; so was the gospel. Harvest-time is busy time; all must be then at work. Harvest-time is a short time, and harvest-work must be done then, or not at all; so the time of the gospel is a season, which if once past, cannot be recalled. God sometimes uses very weak and unlikely instruments for beginning and carrying on a good work. Our Saviour, by teaching one poor woman, spread knowledge to a whole town. Blessed are those who are not offended at Christ. Those taught of God, are truly desirous to learn more. It adds much to the praise of our love to Christ and his word, if it conquers prejudices. Their faith grew. In the matter of it: they believed him to be the Saviour, not only of the Jews but of the world. In the certainty of it: we know that this is indeed the Christ. And in the ground of it, for we have heard him ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him, ... - There is seldom an instance of so remarkable success as this. From a single conversation, in circumstances, in a place, and with an individual little likely to be attended with such results, many sinners were converted; many believed on the testimony of the woman; many more came to hear, and believed because they heard him themselves. We should never despair of doing good in the most unpromising circumstances, and we should seize upon every opportunity to converse with sinners on the great subject of their souls' salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39-42. many &#8230; believed, &c.&#8212;The truth of Joh 4:35 begins to appear. These Samaritans were the foundation of the Church afterwards built up there. No miracle appears to have been wrought there (but unparalleled supernatural knowledge displayed): "we have heard Him ourselves" (Joh 4:42) sufficed to raise their faith to a point never attained by the Jews, and hardly as yet by the disciples&#8212;that He was "the Saviour of the world" [Alford]. "This incident is further remarkable as a rare instance of the Lord's ministry producing an awakening on a large scale" [Olshausen].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">That city</span> was Sichem, or Sychar, but it was within the province of Samaria, from whence it is that they had the name of Samaritans as well as Sichemites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Many</span> of them, upon the testimony of the woman; That he had told her such secret passages of her life, as he could not have told her if he had not been able, if he had pleased, as well to have told her all things, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">believed on him; </span> that is, they owned him as a prophet, and agreed to what the woman said in that particular, and were by it excited to come to see and further discourse with Christ.

Its several features are so original, and so pyschologically true, and the words of Jesus (see especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father....">John 4:21-24</a>) come so directly from the living depths of His soul, that the exceptions taken against certain particulars (as, for instance, against the misunderstandings on the part of the woman; against the words concerning the food, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-32.htm" title="But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you know not of.">John 4:32</a>; against the command of Jesus, “Go, call thy husband;” against the woman’s question concerning the place of worship; against the faith of the Samaritans, which is said to contradict <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-53.htm" title="And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.">Luke 9:53</a>) are of no real weight, and are explicable only by the very authenticity of the narrative, not by the supposition of an intentional poetizing. This is in answer to Strauss, B. Bauer, and partly Weisse; also to Scholten, who considers that the author’s object was to describe in a non-historical picture the <span class="ital">spirit</span> which actuated Jesus even towards the Samaritans. As a full guarantee for that part of the narrative, which the disciples, being absent, could not have witnessed, we may, considering the vivid impress of genuineness which marks it, fairly assume that Jesus Himself communicated it to the evangelist, and there is no need for the unfounded supposition that (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-8.htm" title="(For his disciples were gone away to the city to buy meat.)">John 4:8</a>) John was left behind with Jesus (Hengstenberg, Godet). When, finally, Baur (p. 145 ff.; comp. also Hilgenfeld) resolves our history into a <span class="ital">typus</span>,—“the Samaritan woman being a figure of <span class="ital">heathendom</span>, susceptible, readily opening itself to faith, and presenting a wide harvest field,” a contrast to Nicodemus, the type of unsusceptible Judaism,—with all this arbitrariness on the part of the inventor, it is passing strange, if this were his object, that he did not bring Jesus into contact with a real <span class="ital">heathen</span> woman, for this would have been quite as easy to invent; and that he should keep the words of the woman so free from the least tinge of anything of a <span class="ital">heathen</span> nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-20.htm" title="Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.">John 4:20</a> ff.), and have put into her mouth so clear an expression of Messianic hope (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm" title="The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.">John 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-42.htm" title="And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.">John 4:42</a>),—this bungling is quite out of character on the part of such an inventor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/4-39.htm" title="And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did....">John 4:39-42</a> briefly sum up the results of the Lord’s visit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">39</span>. <span class="ital">many of the Samaritans</span>] Strong proof of the truth of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a></span>.
