Every outer fact is the sign of an inner truth. They here, as the woman in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-11.htm" title="The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where then have you that living water?">John 4:11</a>, as the teacher of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-4.htm" title="Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?">John 3:4</a>), as the Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-20.htm" title="Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?">John 2:20</a>), speak in the language of the outer facts only. He speaks of the spiritual realities. Looking on the fields of springing corn, they would say that in four months there would be harvest. He sees signs of life springing up from seed sown in receptive hearts; and eyes lifted up and directed to the wide fields of the world’s nations would see that the fulness of time was come, and that the fields were even now white to harvest. The Samaritans coming to Him are as the firstfruits, the earnest of the abundant sheaves which shall follow.<p><span class= "bld">Four months.</span>—This gives us probably a note on time. There is no evidence that it was a proverbial saying, and the form of the sentence is against the supposition. The legal beginning of harvest was fixed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:">Leviticus 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm" title="Seven weeks shall you number to you: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as you begin to put the sickle to the corn.">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>) for the 16th of Nisan (April). This would give us in that year, which was a Jewish leap-year, with a month added (Wieseler’s <span class= "ital">Synopsis,</span> Eng. Trans., p. 187), some time about the middle of the month Tebeth (January) as the date of this conversation.

And, 3d, Because if there had been such a proverb, it would have been improper to apply it here, since our Lord was not speaking of the period of time between the prophets’ sowing, and the apostles’ reaping; (to which four months has no analogy;) but only means to tell them, that though they reckoned yet four months to the <span class="ital">earthly harvest, </span>the <span class="ital">spiritual harvest </span>was now ripe. So that I choose, as Sir Isaac Newton does, to take the words in their plainest sense, as an intimation that there were then four months to the beginning of harvest. And I take this passage to be of great importance for settling the chronology of Christ’s ministry.” <span class="ital">Lift up your eyes, </span>even now, <span class="ital">and look on the fields </span>round about you, <span class="ital">for they are white already to harvest </span>— Laden with a plentiful crop of ripe corn. He alluded to the disposition of the people in general to receive the gospel, and more particularly to the multitude of the Samaritans, who, struck with the report of the woman, were coming in such numbers as covered the ground, to inquire after him as the Messiah, and to hear his doctrine; and unto whom he pointed and directed his disciples to look, as being within their view. And, as they laboured together with him in this spiritual harvest, to encourage them, he puts them in mind of the reward, adding, <span class="ital">And he that reapeth </span>— The harvest of which I now speak; he that by labouring in the word and doctrine converts sinners, and turns them to God; <span class="ital">receiveth wages </span>— Infinitely more valuable than men can give; <span class="ital">and gathereth fruit unto life eternal </span>— Both saves himself and those that hear him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-16.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, and to the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.">1 Timothy 4:16</a>. Christ compares the case of a faithful Christian minister to that of a considerate reaper, who is supported in his fatigue, not only by a regard to his own wages, but to the advantage which the public receives by the harvest he gathers in. This the original expression, <span class="greekheb">συναγει καρπον εις ζωην αιωνιον</span>, seems plainly to import, and so is parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-20.htm" title="Let him know, that he which converts the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.">James 5:20</a>, <span class="ital">He that converteth a sinner shall save a soul from death, </span>&c., and suggests a most forcible consideration to diligence and zeal. If the spiritual reaper save his own soul, even that is fruit abounding to his account, fruit gathered to <span class="ital">life eternal. </span>And if, over and above this, he be instrumental in saving the souls of others too, there also is fruit gathered, good fruit, the fruit that Christ seeks for, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm" title="Now I would not have you ignorant, brothers, that oftentimes I purposed to come to you, (but was let till now,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.">Romans 1:13</a>. This is the comfort of faithful ministers, that their work has a tendency to, and is instrumental of, the eternal salvation of precious souls.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:27-42 The disciples wondered that Christ talked thus with a Samaritan. Yet they knew it was for some good reason, and for some good end. Thus when particular difficulties occur in the word and providence of God, it is good to satisfy ourselves that all is well that Jesus Christ says and does. Two things affected the woman. The extent of his knowledge. Christ knows all the thoughts, words, and actions, of all the children of men. And the power of his word. He told her secret sins with power. She fastened upon that part of Christ's discourse, many would think she would have been most shy of repeating; but the knowledge of Christ, into which we are led by conviction of sin, is most likely to be sound and saving. They came to him: those who would know Christ, must meet him where he records his name. Our Master has left us an example, that we may learn to do the will of God as he did; with diligence, as those that make a business of it; with delight and pleasure in it. Christ compares his work to harvest-work. The harvest is appointed and looked for before it comes; so was the gospel. Harvest-time is busy time; all must be then at work. Harvest-time is a short time, and harvest-work must be done then, or not at all; so the time of the gospel is a season, which if once past, cannot be recalled. God sometimes uses very weak and unlikely instruments for beginning and carrying on a good work. Our Saviour, by teaching one poor woman, spread knowledge to a whole town. Blessed are those who are not offended at Christ. Those taught of God, are truly desirous to learn more. It adds much to the praise of our love to Christ and his word, if it conquers prejudices. Their faith grew. In the matter of it: they believed him to be the Saviour, not only of the Jews but of the world. In the certainty of it: we know that this is indeed the Christ. And in the ground of it, for we have heard him ourselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Say not ye - This seems to have been a proverb. Ye say - that is, men say.<p>Four months and ... - The common time from sowing the seed to the harvest, in Judea, was about "four months." The meaning of this passage may be thus expressed: "The husbandman, when he sows his seed, is compelled to wait a considerable period before it produces a crop. He is encouraged in sowing it; he expects fruit; his labor is lightened by that expectation; but it is not "immediate" - it is remote. But it is not so with my preaching. The seed has already sprung up. Scarce was it sown before it produced an abundant harvest. The gospel was just preached to a woman, and see how many of the Samaritans come to hear it also. There is therefore more encouragement to labor in this field than the farmer has to sow his grain."<p>Lift up your eyes - See the Samaritans coming to hear the gospel.<p>They are white - Grain, when ripe, turns from a green to a yellow or light color, indicating that it is time to reap it. So here were indications that the gospel was effectual, and that the harvest was to be gathered in. Hence, we may learn:<p>1. that there is as much encouragement to attempt to save souls as the farmer has to raise a crop.<p>2. that the gospel is fitted to make an immediate impression on the minds of men. We are to expect that it will. We are not to wait to some future period, as if we could not expect immediate results. This wicked and ignorant people - little likely, apparently, to be affected - turned to God, heard the voice of the Saviour, and came in multitudes to him.<p>3. We are to expect revivals of religion. Here was one instance of it under the Saviour's own preaching. Multitudes were excited, moved, and came to learn the way of life.<p>4. We know not how much good may be done by conversation with even a single individual. This conversation with a woman resulted in a deep interest felt throughout the city, and in the conversion of many of them to God. So, a single individual may often be the means, in the hand of God, of leading many to the cross of Jesus.<p>5. What evils may follow from neglecting to do our duty! How easily might Jesus have alleged, if he had been like many of his professed disciples, that he was weary, that he was hungry, that it was esteemed improper to converse with a woman alone, that she was an abandoned character, and there could be little hope of doing her good! How many consciences of ministers and Christians would have been satisfied with reasoning like this? Yet Jesus, in spite of his fatigue and thirst, and all the difficulties of the case, seriously set about seeking the conversion of this woman. And behold what a glorious result! The city was moved, and a great harvest was found ready to be gathered in! "Let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35. yet four months, and then harvest&#8212;that is, "In current speech, ye say thus at this season; but lift up your eyes and look upon those fields in the light of another husbandry, for lo! in that sense, they are even now white to harvest, ready for the sickle." The simple beauty of this language is only surpassed by the glow of holy emotion in the Redeemer's own soul which it expresses. It refers to the ripeness of these Sycharites for accession to Him, and the joy of this great Lord of the reapers over the anticipated ingathering. Oh, could we but so, "lift up our eyes and look" upon many fields abroad and at home, which to dull sense appear unpromising, as He beheld those of Samaria, what movements, as yet scarce in embryo, and accessions to Christ, as yet seemingly far distant, might we not discern as quite near at hand, and thus, amidst difficulties and discouragements too much for nature to sustain, be cheered&#8212;as our Lord Himself was in circumstances far more overwhelming&#8212;with "songs in the night!"<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There was in those countries but four months’ space betwixt seed time and harvest; yet they fed themselves (as soon as they had sown) with the expectation of it. My harvest, saith our Saviour, is the gaining of souls for my Father: look yonder what a troop of the citizens of Sichem are coming to me, upon my revelation of myself to the woman of Samaria; I have but just sown my seed, and the fields are white to this spiritual harvest, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-37.htm" title="Then said he to his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborers are few;">Matthew 9:37</a></span>. In the judgement of the, best interpreters, our Saviour in this verse useth a comparison, and passeth from his similitude used in the former part of the verse, fetched from a worldly harvest, to discourse of that spiritual harvest, which he by and by reaped of the citizens of Sichem coming to him; it is of that he saith, that the fields were already white, by which (as will appear from the following verses) he quickeneth his disciples to put in their sickles. Some critical authors, understanding both the former and latter part of the text of a worldly harvest, have used their wits to determine how the fields should be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">white to harvest</span> four months before it came; but the most and best interpreters interpret the latter part of a spiritual harvest, and that will be also justified by what followeth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Say not ye, there are yet four months,.... Our Lord had been in Jerusalem and Judea, about eight months from the last passover, and there remained four more to the next passover: <p>and then cometh harvest? barley harvest, which began at that time. Now as the passover was in the middle of the month Nisan, which was about the latter end of our March; reckoning four months back from thence shows, that it was about the latter end of our November, or beginning of December, that Christ was in Samaria, and at Jacob's well. Some think, that this does not refer to the then present time, as if there were so many months from thence to the next harvest, but to a common way of speaking, that there were four months from seed time to harvest; during which time there was a comfortable hope, and longing expectation of it: but this will, by no means, agree either with the wheat or barley harvest. The wheat was sown before this time, and the barley a good while after. <p>"Half Tisri, Marcheshvan, and half Cisleu, were,  seed time (w)'' <p>The earliest they sowed their wheat was in Tisri, which answers to our September and October; i.e. to half one, and half the other. The month of Marcheshvan, which answers to October and November, was the principal month for sowing it (x): hence that paraphrase on  <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a>, <p>"give a good part of thy seed to thy field in Tisri, and do not refrain from sowing even in Cisleu.'' <p>As for the barley, that was sown in the months of Shebet and Adar, and usually in the latter (y); the former of which answers to January and February, and the latter to February and March. And we read (z) of their sowing seventy days before the passover, which was within six weeks of the beginning of barley harvest. <p>Behold, I say unto you, lift up your eyes, and look on the fields: pointing to the lands which lay near the city of Sychar: <p>for they are white already to harvest; alluding to the corn fields, which, when ripe, and near harvest, look white: hence we read (a) of  , "the white field": which the Jews say is a field sown with wheat or barley, and so called to distinguish it from a field planted with trees; though it may be rather, that it is so called from its white look when ripe. So the three Targums paraphrase  <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-12.htm">Genesis 49:12</a>, <p>"his hills (his valleys, or fields, as Onkelos)  "are white" with corn, and flocks of sheep.'' <p>Christ here speaks not literally; for the fields could not be white at such a distance from harvest; but spiritually, of a harvest of souls; and has regard to the large number of Samaritans that were just now coming out of the city, and were within sight, and covered the adjacent fields: and these he calls upon his disciples to lift up their eyes and behold; and suggests to them, that it was not a time for eating and drinking, but for working, since here was such a number of souls to be gathered in: and thus as from corporeal food he proceeded to treat of spiritual food; so from a literal harvest he goes on to speak of a spiritual one, and encourages his disciples to labour in it, by the following arguments. <p>(w) T.

The approaching townspeople now showed how greatly already the <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ποιῶ</span> was in process of accomplishment. They were coming through the corn-field, now tinged with green; and thus they make the fields, which for four months would not yield the harvest, in a higher sense already white harvest-fields.

If the former, then the disciples had probably been speaking of the dearness of the provisions they had bought, and congratulating themselves that harvest would lower them.

That it is a proverb is also favoured by the metrical form <span class="greekheb">ἔτι τετράμηνόν ἐστι καὶ ὁ θερισμὸς ἔρχεται</span>. No trace of such a proverb has been found, but that some such saying should be current was inevitable, the waiting of the husbandman being typical of so much of human life. (Wetstein quotes from Ovid (<span class="ital">Heroid.</span>, xvii. 263), “adhuc tua messis in herba est,” and many other parallels.) If this was a proverbial expression to give encouragement to the sower, we cannot infer from its use here that the time was December. Our Lord quotes it for the sake of the contrast between the ordinary relation of harvest to seed-time, and that which they can recognise by lifting their eyes.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπάρατε τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν</span>.… Your harvest is already here. What the disciples see when they lift their eyes from their food is the crowd of Samaritans ripe for the kingdom and now approaching them. In Samaria a long time might have been expected to elapse between sowing and reaping; but no!—<span class="greekheb">λευκαί εἰσι</span> … the fields are already ripe for cutting. [<span class="greekheb">λευκαί</span> Wetstein illustrates from Ovid, “maturis <span class="ital">albescit</span> messis aristis”.]<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">35</span>. <span class="ital">Say not ye</span>] The pronoun is again emphatic.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">There are yet four months</span>, &c.] This cannot be a proverb. No such proverb is known; and a proverb on the subject would have to be differently shaped; e.g. ‘From seedtime to harvest is four months,’ or something of the kind. So that we may regard this saying as a mark of time. Harvest began in the middle of Nisan or April. Four months from that would place this event in the middle of December: or, if (as some suppose) this was a year in which an extra month was inserted, in the middle of January.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">are white already to harvest</span>] In the green blades just shewing through the soil the faith of the sower sees the white ears that will soon be there. So also in the flocking of these ignorant Samaritans to Him for instruction Christ sees the abundant harvest of souls that is to follow. ‘Already’ is the last word in the Greek sentence; and from very ancient times there has been a doubt whether it belongs to this sentence or the next. Some of the best MSS. give ‘already’ to the next sentence; ‘already he that reapeth receiveth wages.’ But MS. authority in punctuation is not of much weight. The received punctuation is perhaps better; ‘already’ at the end of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a></span> being in emphatic contrast to ‘yet’ at the beginning of it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm" title="Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.">John 4:35</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τετράμηνος</span>, <span class="ital">four months</span>) Very few copies have <span class="greekheb">τετράμηνον</span>.[85] <span class="greekheb">Τετράμηνος</span> is used in the common gender, as <span class="greekheb">δίμηνος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἓκμηνος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἑξάμηνος</span>; see Scapula on <span class="greekheb">μήν</span>.

[<span class="ital">Coresponding to</span> our <span class="ital">April, May, June, and July</span>.—V. g.] The wheat harvest, which is called actually <span class="ital">the harvest</span>, differs from the barley harvest. The beginning of the one was about the time of Passover: that of the other was considerably subsequent; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-25.htm" title="And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.">Exodus 9:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/9-31.htm" title="And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom....">Exodus 9:31-32</a>, “The barley was smitten, for the barley was in the ear; but the wheat and the rye were not smitten; for they were not grown up;” to wit, in Palestine, about the time of Pentecost, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-22.htm" title="And you shall observe the feast of weeks, of the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.">Exodus 34:22</a>, “Thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the first fruits of wheat-harvest.” Moreover, the harvest was later in Galilee than in Judea. And so the feast ordained by Jeroboam was <span class="ital">later</span> [than that in Judea], <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-32.htm" title="And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like to the feast that is in Judah, and he offered on the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.">1 Kings 12:32</a>, “Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah;” comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:34</a>, “The fifteenth day of the seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles.” And they were generally Galileans, to whom the words were addressed, <span class="ital">Do ye not say!</span> Finally, in that year in which these words were spoken, the first day of Thammuz was the 13th of June, which was very speedily [early], for on the following year, the 6th day of June had Pentecost itself in fine [<span class="ital">i.e.</span> Pentecost was not till the 6th of June], the time when wheat harvest commences.[86] In fact, therefore, the wheat <span class="ital">harvest</span> of the Galileans, <span class="ital">in the fourth month</span> after this discourse, began quickly enough [to meet the requirements of the case] in the month Thammuz.

The antithesis to the words here is, <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς λέγετε</span>, <span class="ital">ye say</span>, who look more to external things.

Text. But <span class="greekheb">τετράμηνος</span> ABCD Orig.—E. and T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[86] What Beng. wishes to prove is, that Thammuz, this year, was the month of the Galilean harvest; for the first of Thammuz this year was the 13th of June, which was very soon for Thammuz commencing, inasmuch as, on the following year, even Pentecost itself (seven weeks after Passover, or the 15th of Nisan; <span class="ital">i.e.</span> early in Sivan) did not occur till 6th of June: so that Pentecost (early in Sivan) which was the harvest-time, being the 6th of June, Thammuz would be considerably later. But in the year when our Lord speaks, Thammuz comes soon enough for the late harvest of Galilee to have occurred in it.—E. and T.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[87] <span class="ital">Whoever desires a further vindication of this view</span>, <span class="ital">may be referred to my</span> Beleuchtung der Erinnerungen, etc., § 29, p. 111, etc., <span class="ital">and especially</span> p. 116, etc., <span class="ital">where there is brought forward from</span> Harm.

I cannot doubt that it was a chronological hint that the time at which Jesus spake was four months from either the barley or wheat harvest. These harvests generally occurred between the middle of March and the middle of April. The time must, therefore, have been either the middle of November or of December. Tristram (Westcott) says the (wheat?) harvest began about the middle of April and lasted till the end of May. This would bring the time forward another month. This makes our Lord to have spent some eight months since the Passover, either in Jerusalem or in the Judaean land, on his earliest mission, which as yet had brought no obvious results. Men had come to his baptism, but had not appreciated or accepted his claims. The faith already awakened had been of the evanescent character, based on "signs," outward not inward, a "milk faith," to which he did not entrust himself (ch, 2:240. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; they are whitening</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">harvest</span>. Our Lord now uses another metaphor - he bids the disciples glance across these rich cornfields, to observe the obvious effect already produced by the sowing of good seed in Samaritan soil. The people are flocking towards him. The harvest of souls is ripening, and it is great. You must wait four months before this springing corn will need the sickle. But I say unto you, The time is come. The kingdom is come. The reaper must prepare for instant service. Again, we have a note of personal identity between the Jesus of the Fourth Gospel and the Author of the parables of the sower and the harvest. The very rapidity with which he passes from the symbolism of <span class="accented">water</span> to the symbolism <span class="accented">of food</span>, and then to that of <span class="accented">seed time and harvest</span>, reminds us of One who "without a parable spake not." The words so far have universal application in every age. The harvest has always been ripening. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is used in this place only for the aspect of ripening corn. It has elsewhere the meaning of glittering, translucent whiteness, and perhaps it is used here for "dead ripe." The golden grain in late summer becomes white, and this intensifies the force of the image. It seems to say, "These fields will be sacrificed, these fruits will be wasted, these souls will be lost, unless they are reaped and brought into the heavenly garner." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Say not ye<p>In what follows, Jesus is contrasting the natural harvest-time with the spiritual, which was immediately to take place in the ingathering of the Samaritans.
