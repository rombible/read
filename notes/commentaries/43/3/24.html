(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-3.htm" title="He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.">John 4:3</a>, and Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm" title="Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;">Matthew 4:12</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:22-36 John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; but Jesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For John was not yet cast into prison - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-20.htm">Luke 3:20</a>. The mention of this shows that John was not imprisoned until some time after our Lord entered on his ministry. The design of John was to call men to repentance, and to prepare them for the Messiah, and this he continued to do after our Saviour commenced his work. It shows that a minister of religion should be industrious to the day of his death. John still toiled in his work not the "less" because the Messiah had come. So ministers should not labor less when Christ appears by his Spirit, and takes the work into his own hands, and turns many to himself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. John not yet cast into prison&#8212;Hence it is plain that our Lord's ministry did not commence with the imprisonment of John, though, but for this, we should have drawn that inference from Mt 4:12 and Mark's (Mr 1:14) express statement.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> For John was yet in the exercise of his public ministry, not cast into prison, as he was soon after. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For John was not yet cast into prison.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm" title="Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;">Matthew 4:12</a>. Apart from that purpose of correction, which is specially apparent if we compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-17.htm" title="From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.">Matthew 4:17</a> (subtleties to the contrary in Ebrard), the remark, which was quite intelligible of itself, would be, to say the least, superfluous,—unnecessary even to gain space for bringing Jesus and the Baptist again alongside each other (Keim), even if we were to venture to propose the suggestion, of which the text says nothing, that Jesus felt himself obliged, as the time of the Baptist was not yet expired, to bring the kingdom of God near, in keeping with the form which the Baptist had adopted (Luthardt, p. 79).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[170] It is supposed, indeed, that John simply wishes to intimate that what he records, vv. 22–36, must be placed <span class="ital">before</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm" title="Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;">Matthew 4:12</a> (Hengstenberg).

This corrects the impression, naturally derived from the Synoptists, that Christ’s public ministry did not commence till after the imprisonment of the Baptist. The whole of these first three chapters and part of the fourth must be placed before <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm" title="Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;">Matthew 4:12</a>, where there are great gaps in the history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-24.htm" title="For John was not yet cast into prison.">John 3:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὔτω</span>, <span class="ital">not yet</span>) Here the Evangelist takes for granted, what the others [Matthew, Mark, and Luke] bad written concerning the imprisonment of John the Baptist.—<span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) Therefore John ceased to baptize, when he was cast into prison; not before.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For John had not yet been cast into the prison.</span> This clause shows that the evangelist was alive to the apparent discrepancy which his account of a Judaean ministry might otherwise have suggested with the synoptic chronological <span class="accented">initium</span> of the Galilaean ministry. The remark shows that all that happened preceded that ministry, and equates the journey through Samaria with that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12</a>. Even Hilgenfeld says, "<span class="accented">Involuntarily</span> the fourth evangelist here testifies to his acquaintance with the synoptical narrative." In our opinion it was designed and spontaneous. The first journey to Galilee, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-43.htm">John 1:43</a>, was not the commencement of a public prophetic ministry, and the synoptists are silent about it. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, he "<span class="accented">withdrew</span>," shows that there was some reason for his abrupt departure, over and above what was stated. John gives the reason for the departure by <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1, 2</a>, where the conduct of the Pharisees was becoming more watchful and jealous. The authority which John here assumes to correct and enlarge apostolic tradition, reveals the claim of one who professed unique knowledge of inexpugnable facts. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Prison (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/5-18.htm">Acts 5:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-21.htm">Acts 5:21</a>. </body></html>
