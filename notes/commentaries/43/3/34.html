It is the divine image in man which recognises divinity. Every human faculty finds its true work, and true satisfaction, and the true object of its being, in Him; and therefore the whole man knows that His words are true, and recognises that He speaks the words of God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-10.htm" title="He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself: he that believes not God has made him a liar; because he believes not the record that God gave of his Son.">1John 5:10</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">For God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</span>—The italics will show that the words “unto Him” are added in our version; and it is probable that the word “God,” which has been repeated from the first clause of the verse, should be also omitted here. We have then to read, “For He giveth not the Spirit by measure;” or, possibly, “For the Spirit giveth not by measure.” If, however, we remember that John the Baptist is the speaker, and that he had seen “the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon Him” (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a>, and comp. such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-13.htm" title="If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?">Luke 11:13</a>, and in this Gospel <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>), we shall still interpret the words in the sense which our version gives. The words “by measure,” in the sense of limitation, are frequent in the classical and rabbinical writings. The Rabbis seem to have applied the phrase to prophets and teachers, saying that the Spirit dwelt in the prophets only in a certain measure. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-9.htm" title="And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.">2Kings 2:9</a>, where Elisha prays for “a double portion,” or, more exactly, <span class= "ital">a portion of two</span>—the portion of the first-born son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-17.htm" title="But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he has: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>)—of the spirit of Elijah. The same thought meets us in St. Paul (himself a pupil of Gamaliel), who speaks of “the self-same Spirit dividing to every man severally as He will” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.">1Corinthians 12:4-12</a>). The opposite of this thought, then, is before us here. God gives in this case not as in others. The Son who cometh from above is above all. There is no gift of prophet, or of teacher, which is not given to Him. He has the fulness of the spiritual gifts which in part are given to men, and He speaks the very words of God. It will be noted that John is still expounding to his disciples the meaning of his own declaration, “He must increase, but I must decrease.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:22-36 John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; but Jesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whom God hath sent - The Messiah.<p>Speaketh the words of God - The truth, or commands of God.<p>For God giveth not the Spirit - The Spirit of God.

It means the entire fulness of divine life and divine power. The present tense "giveth," very aptly points out the permanent communication of the Spirit by the Father to the Son, so that a constant flow and reflow of living power is to be understood (Compare Joh 1:15) [Olshausen].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He whom God hath sent</span> out of heaven, out of his bosom, not merely authorizing him as a minister, as the prophets and as John were sent, <span class="bld">speaketh</span> nothing but the <span class="bld">words of God.</span> The prophets and the apostles were sent of God in a sense, but not as Christ was sent; they sometimes spake the words of God, when the Spirit of God came upon them; but they sometimes spake their own words, as Nathan did to David, when he encouraged his thoughts to build a house to the Lord; and Paul, when he said, <span class="ital">To the rest speak I, not the Lord; </span> but whatsoever Christ spake was the words of God: for God did not give out the Spirit to him sparingly, (as out of a measure), as he doth to his ministers or saints, who have but their proportion of revelations and graces, as was requisite for their offices to which they were called, and the several periods of time that were gradually illuminated.

This the context demands. But the following <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ ἐκ μέτρου</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., must be taken as <span class="ital">a general statement</span>, because there is no <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span>. <span class="ital">Commentators</span> would quite arbitrarily supply <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span>,[177] so as to render it, not by measure or limitation, <span class="ital">but without measure and in complete fulness, God gives the Holy Spirit to Christ</span>. This supplement, unsuitable in itself, should have been excluded by the present <span class="greekheb">δίδωσιν</span>, because we must regard Christ as <span class="ital">possessing</span> the Spirit <span class="ital">long before</span>. The meaning of this <span class="ital">general statement</span> is rather: “<span class="ital">He does not give the Spirit according to measure</span>” (as if it consequently were out of His power, or He were unwilling to give the Spirit beyond a certain quantitative degree, determined by a definite measure); He proceeds herein <span class="ital">independently of any</span> <span class="greekheb">μέτρον</span>, confined and limited by no restricting standard.

The reason assigned for the truth and trustworthiness of Christ’s words is scarcely the reason we expect: <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ</span> … <span class="greekheb">Πνεῦμα</span>. John has told us that Christ is to be believed because He testifies of what He hath seen and heard: now, because the Spirit is given without measure to Him. The meaning of the clause is contested. The omission of <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεός</span> does not materially affect the sense, for <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεός</span> would naturally be supplied as the nominative to <span class="greekheb">δίδωσι</span> from <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θεοῦ</span> of the preceding clause. There are four interpretations. (1) Augustine, Calvin, Lücke, Alford, suppose the clause means that God, instead of giving occasional and limited supplies of the Spirit as had been given to the prophets, gives to Christ the fulness of the Spirit. (2) Meyer thinks that the primary reference is not to Christ but that the statement is general, that God gives the Spirit freely and abundantly, and does thus dispense it to Christ. (3) Westcott, following Cyril, makes Christ the subject and understands the clause as meaning that He proves His Messiahship by giving the Spirit without measure. (4) Godet makes <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> the subject, not the object, and supposes the meaning to be that the Spirit gives to Christ the words of God without measure. The words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-35.htm" title="The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.">John 3:35</a> seem to weigh in favour of the rendering of A.V[47]: “God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto Him”. The R.V[48] is ambiguous. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ μέτρου</span>, out of a measure, or, by measure, that is, sparingly. So <span class="greekheb">ἐν μέτρῳ</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-11.htm" title="You shall drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shall you drink.">Ezekiel 4:11</a>. Wetstein quotes: “R. Achan dixit: etiam Spiritus S. non habitavit super Prophetas nisi mensura quadam: quidam enim librum unum, quidam duos vaticiniorum ediderunt”. The Spirit was given to Jesus not in the restricted and occasional manner in which it had been given to the O.T. prophets, but wholly, fully, constantly. It was by this Spirit His human nature was enlightened and guided to speak things divine; and this Spirit, interposed as it were between the Logos and the human nature of Christ, was as little cumbrous in its operation or perceptible in consciousness as our breath which is interposed between the thinking mind and the words which utter it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[47] Authorised Version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[48] Revised Version.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">34</span>. <span class="ital">whom God hath sent</span>] Better, <span class="ital">whom God</span> <span class="bld">sent</span>, viz.

Some take this clause to refer to all the ambassadors of God, and pre-eminently to the "man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-6.htm">John 1:6</a>) sent from God, whose name was John." But, on the ether hand, observe that throughout the Gospel, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> are used of the "Lord from heaven" (ver. 17).

The clause that follows (seeing that "<span class="accented">to</span> him" <span class="accented">is</span> unquestionably a gloss of translators, and is not found in any manuscripts) may be translated in three different ways. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">For God giveth not the Spirit by measure</span>; for if <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is omitted, still the same subject, "God," might be and is generally supplied, and the object, supposed to be either Christ or any of his servants to whom in these days of the baptism of the Spirit, the Holy Ghost is poured forth from an inexhaustible treasure. Augustine and Calvin urged that it was said concerning Christ; for we read in ver. 35 that "the Father hath given all things into his hand;" but exclusively to limit the object of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> to Christ is more than the passage will justify. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">For he</span> (the Messiah, <span class="accented">sc.</span>) <span class="accented">giveth not the Spirit by measure</span>; <span class="accented">i.e. He</span> is exalted to pour forth from the heart of the Deity the Spirit of the Father and Son. This is preferred by Westcott, and by those who see in the entire passage the reflections of the author of the Gospel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">For the Spirit giveth not by measure</span>; the object (<span class="accented">sc.</span>) being "the words of God," which he who is sent and is coming from heaven, and is above all, is now lavishing upon the world. This translation (Godet) is in harmony with the vision of John at the baptism, when the Holy Spirit after the manner of a dove descended and abode upon him. With an unmeasurable supply of spiritual energy was the <span class="accented">humanity</span> of him who came (<span class="accented">qua</span> his Divine nature and personality) from heaven enriched for his prophetic and Messianic functions as the beloved Son of God on earth. I see no difficulty in this last interpretation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The present tense is justified by the statement of the abiding of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus, and the continuous operation of the gift in the "words of God," which were flowing from his lips. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> is easily supplied in thought. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> The connection is thus instituted with the thirty-fifth verse. Meyer and Lange prefer a wider significance being given to the words, seeing in them a broad reference to the affluence and measureless capacity of the gift of the Spirit. Luthardt: "This is true of all God's messengers, but especially of him of whom the Baptist speaks" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-12</a>). The Lord from heaven receives all the gifts of the Spirit. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The words (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;)<p>Not words, nor individual words, but the words - the complete message of God. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-37.htm">Luke 1:37</a>.<p>God giveth<p>The best texts omit God. Rev., He giveth. Rev., also, rightly, omits the italicized to Him. The personal object of the verb giveth is indefinite. Render, He giveth not the Spirit by measure.<p>In order to convey the full force of the terms giveth and by measure, it will be necessary to attempt an explanation of the general scope and meaning of this very difficult and much disputed passage. The starting point of the exposition must be <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>, the Baptist's noble resignation of his own position, and claims to Jesus: He must increase, but I must decrease. At this point the Evangelist, as we have seen, takes up the discourse. The Baptist's declaration that Jesus "must increase" - that He is a messenger of a transcendently higher character, and with a far larger and more significant message than his own - furnishes the Evangelist with a text. He will show why Jesus "must increase." He must increase because He comes from above, and is therefore supreme over all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31</a>). This statement he repeats; defining from above (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;) by out of heaven (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;), and emphasizing it by contrast with mere earthly witness (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;) whose words bear the stamp of his earthly origin (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;). Being from heaven, He testifies of heavenly things, as an eye-and ear-witness. "What He hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness." It is indeed true that men reject this testimony. "No man receiveth His witness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-32.htm">John 3:32</a>). None the less it is worthy of implicit credence as the testimony of God himself. He that has received that testimony has solemnly attested it as God's own witness; "hath set his seal to this, that God is true." To declare Jesus' testimony untrue is to declare God untrue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-33.htm">John 3:33</a>). For He whom God hath sent utters the whole divine message (the words of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>).<p>Thus far the reasoning is directed to the conclusion that Jesus ought to increase, and that His message ought to be received. He is God's own messenger out of heaven, and speaks God's own words.<p>The common explanation of the succeeding clause is that God bestows the Spirit upon Jesus in His fullness, "not by measure."<p>But this is to repeat what has already been more than implied. It would seem to be superfluous to say of one who comes out of heaven, who is supreme over all things, who bears witness of heavenly things which He has seen and heard, and who reveals the whole message of God to men - that God bestows upon Him the Spirit without measure.<p>Take up, then, the chain of thought from the first clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>, and follow it on another line. The Messenger of God speaks the words of God, and thus shows himself worthy of credence, and shows this further, by dispensing the gift of the Spirit in full measure to His disciples. "He giveth not the Spirit by measure." This interpretation adds a new link to the chain of thought; a new reason why Jesus should increase, and His testimony be received; the reason, namely, that not only is He himself divinely endowed with the Spirit, but that He proves it by dispensing the Spirit in full measure.<p>Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-35.htm">John 3:35</a> follows in natural sequence. This dispensing power which attests His claims, is His through the gift of the divine Father's love. "The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand." This latter phrase, into His hand, signifies not only possession, but the power of disposal. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-31.htm">Mark 9:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-41.htm">Mark 14:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>. God has given the Son all things to administer according to His own pleasure and rule. These two ideas of Christ's reception and bestowment of divine gifts are combined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-27.htm">Matthew 11:27</a>. "All things are delivered unto me of my Father; and no man knoweth the Son but the Father, neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son, and He to whomsoever the Son may determine (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) to reveal Him."<p>Therefore John the Baptist must decrease, and Jesus must increase. A measure of the Spirit was given to the Baptist, sufficient for his preparatory work, but the Baptist himself saw the Spirit descending in a bodily form upon the Son of God, and heard the voice from heaven, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." The Spirit is thus Christ's own. He dispenses, gives it (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), in its fullness. Hence Jesus said, later, of the Spirit of truth, "He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine; therefore said I that He shall take of mine and shall show it unto you" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-14.htm">John 16:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-15.htm">John 16:15</a>). </body></html>
