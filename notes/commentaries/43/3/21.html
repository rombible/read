Regarding truth as the work of life, he cometh to the light, and though for him too it will be a revelation of sins and errors, and deeds of shame, he hates them the moment he knows them, cuts them from his life at whatever cost, and carries his whole being to the light that it may become really true, and that its true works may be made manifest. He will hate the darkness, for he can have nothing to conceal in it. He will love the light, for everything which it reproves he reproves too, and every ray he can gather from it becomes part of the truth which is his life-work. For the remarkable expression “to do the truth,” which, with its opposite “to do a lie” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm" title="You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you will do.

However full the light which had guided men’s steps had been, it was still part of the true Light which lighteth every man, and must lead to Him. Every work wrought in God had already bound them in union with Him, and prepared them to receive Him. That Light was in the world, in the Law and Prophets of the Old Testament Scriptures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm" title="Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.">Matthew 5:17</a>), in the witness of things invisible ever borne by the things that are made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:">Romans 1:20</a>), in the law written upon the hearts of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-14.htm" title="For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law to themselves:">Romans 2:14-15</a>). As before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm" title="And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.">John 3:19</a>), these words are general, but we may not exclude from them a special meaning. He who spoke them warrants our applying them to characters, like the true Nathanael, in whom there is no guile (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-47.htm" title="Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!">John 1:47</a>); like the rock-man Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-42.htm" title="And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.">John 1:42</a>); like the witness John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-11.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.">Matthew 11:11</a>). Some ground was good when the Sower went forth to sow.<p>Two thoughts are suggested to us at the close of this first discourse. One is, that the writer, with perfect naturalness, says nothing of the effect on Nicodemus, but leaves the after-glimpses to tell their own tale. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-50.htm" title="Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)">John 7:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm" title="And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.">John 19:39</a>.) The other is, that we have come upon teaching distinct in style and matter from that of the earlier Gospels. On this see <span class= "ital">Excursus D: The Discourses in St. John’s Gospel.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-8 Nicodemus was afraid, or ashamed to be seen with Christ, therefore came in the night. When religion is out of fashion, there are many Nicodemites. But though he came by night, Jesus bid him welcome, and hereby taught us to encourage good beginnings, although weak. And though now he came by night, yet afterward he owned Christ publicly. He did not talk with Christ about state affairs, though he was a ruler, but about the concerns of his own soul and its salvation, and went at once to them. Our Saviour spoke of the necessity and nature of regeneration or the new birth, and at once directed Nicodemus to the source of holiness of the heart. Birth is the beginning of life; to be born again, is to begin to live anew, as those who have lived much amiss, or to little purpose. We must have a new nature, new principles, new affections, new aims. By our first birth we were corrupt, shapen in sin; therefore we must be made new creatures. No stronger expression could have been chosen to signify a great and most remarkable change of state and character. We must be entirely different from what we were before, as that which begins to be at any time, is not, and cannot be the same with that which was before. This new birth is from heaven, ch. 1:13, and its tendency is to heaven. It is a great change made in the heart of a sinner, by the power of the Holy Spirit. It means that something is done in us, and for us, which we cannot do for ourselves. Something is wrong, whereby such a life begins as shall last for ever. We cannot otherwise expect any benefit by Christ; it is necessary to our happiness here and hereafter. What Christ speak, Nicodemus misunderstood, as if there had been no other way of regenerating and new-moulding an immortal soul, than by new-framing the body. But he acknowledged his ignorance, which shows a desire to be better informed. It is then further explained by the Lord Jesus. He shows the Author of this blessed change. It is not wrought by any wisdom or power of our own, but by the power of the blessed Spirit. We are shapen in iniquity, which makes it necessary that our nature be changed. We are not to marvel at this; for, when we consider the holiness of God, the depravity of our nature, and the happiness set before us, we shall not think it strange that so much stress is laid upon this. The regenerating work of the Holy Spirit is compared to water. It is also probable that Christ had reference to the ordinance of baptism. Not that all those, and those only, that are baptized, are saved; but without that new birth which is wrought by the Spirit, and signified by baptism, none shall be subjects of the kingdom of heaven. The same word signifies both the wind and the Spirit. The wind bloweth where it listeth for us; God directs it. The Spirit sends his influences where, and when, on whom, and in what measure and degree, he pleases. Though the causes are hidden, the effects are plain, when the soul is brought to mourn for sin, and to breathe after Christ. Christ's stating of the doctrine and the necessity of regeneration, it should seem, made it not clearer to Nicodemus. Thus the things of the Spirit of God are foolishness to the natural man. Many think that cannot be proved, which they cannot believe. Christ's discourse of gospel truths, ver. 11-13, shows the folly of those who make these things strange unto them; and it recommends us to search them out. Jesus Christ is every way able to reveal the will of God to us; for he came down from heaven, and yet is in heaven. We have here a notice of Christ's two distinct natures in one person, so that while he is the Son of man, yet he is in heaven. God is the HE THAT IS, and heaven is the dwelling-place of his holiness. The knowledge of this must be from above, and can be received by faith alone. Jesus Christ came to save us by healing us, as the children of Israel, stung with fiery serpents, were cured and lived by looking up to the brazen serpent, Nu 21:6-9. In this observe the deadly and destructive nature of sin. Ask awakened consciences, ask damned sinners, they will tell you, that how charming soever the allurements of sin may be, at the last it bites like a serpent. See the powerful remedy against this fatal malady. Christ is plainly set forth to us in the gospel. He whom we offended is our Peace, and the way of applying for a cure is by believing. If any so far slight either their disease by sin, or the method of cure by Christ, as not to receive Christ upon his own terms, their ruin is upon their own heads. He has said, Look and be saved, look and live; lift up the eyes of your faith to Christ crucified. And until we have grace to do this, we shall not be cured, but still are wounded with the stings of Satan, and in a dying state. Jesus Christ came to save us by pardoning us, that we might not die by the sentence of the law. Here is gospel, good news indeed. Here is God's love in giving his Son for the world. God so loved the world; so really, so richly. Behold and wonder, that the great God should love such a worthless world! Here, also, is the great gospel duty, to believe in Jesus Christ. God having given him to be our Prophet, Priest, and King, we must give up ourselves to be ruled, and taught, and saved by him. And here is the great gospel benefit, that whoever believes in Christ, shall not perish, but shall have everlasting life. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, and so saving it. It could not be saved, but through him; there is no salvation in any other. From all this is shown the happiness of true believers; he that believeth in Christ is not condemned. Though he has been a great sinner, yet he is not dealt with according to what his sins deserve. How great is the sin of unbelievers! God sent One to save us, that was dearest to himself; and shall he not be dearest to us? How great is the misery of unbelievers! they are condemned already; which speaks a certain condemnation; a present condemnation. The wrath of God now fastens upon them; and their own hearts condemn them. There is also a condemnation grounded on their former guilt; they are open to the law for all their sins; because they are not by faith interested in the gospel pardon. Unbelief is a sin against the remedy. It springs from the enmity of the heart of man to God, from love of sin in some form. Read also the doom of those that would not know Christ. Sinful works are works of darkness. The wicked world keep as far from this light as they can, lest their deeds should be reproved. Christ is hated, because sin is loved. If they had not hated saving knowledge, they would not sit down contentedly in condemning ignorance. On the other hand, renewed hearts bid this light welcome. A good man acts truly and sincerely in all he does. He desires to know what the will of God is, and to do it, though against his own worldly interest. A change in his whole character and conduct has taken place. The love of God is shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost, and is become the commanding principle of his actions. So long as he continues under a load of unforgiven guilt, there can be little else than slavish fear of God; but when his doubts are done away, when he sees the righteous ground whereon this forgiveness is built, he rests on it as his own, and is united to God by unfeigned love. Our works are good when the will of God is the rule of them, and the glory of God the end of them; when they are done in his strength, and for his sake; to him, and not to men. Regeneration, or the new birth, is a subject to which the world is very averse; it is, however, the grand concern, in comparison with which every thing else is but trifling. What does it signify though we have food to eat in plenty, and variety of raiment to put on, if we are not born again? if after a few mornings and evenings spent in unthinking mirth, carnal pleasure, and riot, we die in our sins, and lie down in sorrow? What does it signify though we are well able to act our parts in life, in every other respect, if at last we hear from the Supreme Judge, Depart from me, I know you not, ye workers of iniquity?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Are that doeth truth - He who does right, or he that obeys the truth. Truth here is opposed to error and to evil. The sinner acts from falsehood and error. The good man acts according to truth. The sinner believes a lie - that God will not punish, or that there is no God, or that there is no eternity and no hell. The Christian believes all these, and acts as if they were true.

The actions of good people are performed by the influence and aid of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>. Of course, if they are performed by his aid, they are such as he will approve. Here is presented the character of a good man and a sincere Christian. We learn respecting that character:<p>1. He does truth. He loves it, seeks it, follows it.<p>2. He comes to the light. He does not attempt to deceive himself or others.<p>3. He is willing to know himself, and aims to do it. He desires to know the true state of his heart before God.<p>4. A special object of his efforts is that his deeds may be "wrought in God." He desires to be a good man; to receive continual aid from God, and to perform such actions as he will approve.<p>This is the close of our Lord's discourse with Nicodemus - a discourse condensing the gospel, giving the most striking exhibition and illustration of truth, and representing especially the fundamental doctrine of regeneration and the evidence of the change. It is clear that the Saviour regarded this as lying at the foundation of religion. Without it we cannot possibly be saved. And now it becomes every reader, as in the presence of God, and in view of the judgment-seat of Christ, solemnly to ask himself whether he has experienced this change? whether he knows by experience what it is to be born of that Spirit? If he does he will be saved. If not, he is in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity, and should give no sleep to his eyes until he has made his peace with God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. doeth truth&#8212;whose only object in life is to be and do what will bear the light.

They were drawn by the Father to come to Christ, and were given to Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm" title="All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.">John 6:37</a>); they were of God, and had ears to hear His word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-47.htm" title="He that is of God hears God's words: you therefore hear them not, because you are not of God.">John 8:47</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm" title="Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then?

But according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-19.htm" title="And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.">John 3:19</a>, these were exceptions only amid the multitude of the opposite kind, and even their piety needed purifying and transfiguring into true <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>, which could be attained only by fellowship with Christ; and hence even in their case the way of Christian penitence, by the <span class="greekheb">φανέρωσις</span> of their works wrought in God, brought about by the light of Christ, was not excluded, but was exhibited, and its commencement brought about, because, in view of this complete and highest light, the sincere Old Testament saint must first rightly feel the need of that repentance, and of the lack of moral satisfaction. Consequently the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a>, still holds true.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm" title="But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.">John 3:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ ποιῶν</span> … “On the other hand, he who does the truth” … This is one of John’s comprehensive phrases which perhaps lose by definition. “To do the truth” is at any rate to live up to what one knows; to live an honest, conscientious life. John implies that men of this type are to be found where the light of Christ has not dawned: but when it dawns they hail it with joy. He that doeth the truth comes to the light that his deeds may be manifested, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐν θεῷ ἐστιν εἰργασμένα</span>. Is <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> expressive of a fact or declarative of a reason? Must we translate “manifested, that they are,” etc., or “manifested, because they are,” etc.? The R.V[45] has “that” in the text, and “because” in the margin. Godet and Westcott prefer the former; Lücke, Meyer, Weiss and Weizsäcker the latter. It is not easy to decide between the two. On the whole, the latter interpretation is to be preferred. This clause gives the reason of the willingness shown by the man to have his deeds made manifest: and thus it balances the clause <span class="greekheb">ἦν γὰρ πονηρὰ αὐτῶν τὰ ἔργα</span>, which gives the reason for evil doers shunning the light. He who does the truth is not afraid of the light, but rather seeks increased light because his deeds have been done <span class="greekheb">ἐν θεῷ</span>; that is, he has not been separated from God by them, but has done what he has done because he conceived that to be the will of God. Where such light as exists has been conscientiously used, more is sought, and welcomed when it comes. “Plato was like a man shut into a vault, running hither and thither, with his poor flickering Taper, agonizing to get forthe, and holding himself in readinesse to make a spring forward the moment a door should open. But it never did. ‘Not manie wise are called.’ He had clomb a Hill in the Darke, and stood calling to his companions below, ‘Come on, come on, this way lies the East: I am avised we shall see the sun rise anon’. But they never did. What a Christian he would have made. Ah! he is one now. He and Socrates, the veil long removed from their eyes, are sitting at Jesus’ feet. Sancte Socrates, ora pro nobis” (Erasmus to More in <span class="ital">Sir T. More’s Household</span>).

It is moral rather than intellectual truth that is meant. To ‘do the truth’ is to do that which is true to the moral law (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-32.htm" title="And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.">John 8:32</a>), that which has true moral worth, as opposed to ‘practising worthless things.’ In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-6.htm" title="Rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;">1 Corinthians 13:6</a> we have a similar antithesis: ‘rejoicing with the <span class="ital">truth</span>’ is opposed to ‘rejoicing in <span class="ital">iniquity</span>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that his deeds may be made manifest</span>] ‘His’ is emphatic, ‘<span class="ital">his</span> deeds’ as opposed to those of him that doeth evil. ‘Be made manifest’ balances ‘be reproved.’ The one fears to be convicted; the other courts the light, not for self-glorification, but as loving that to which he feels his works are akin. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wrought in God</span>] Better, <span class="bld">have been</span> <span class="ital">wrought in God</span>. This is his reason for wishing them to be made manifest; it is a manifestation of something divine. The Greek for ‘<span class="ital">that</span> they are’ may mean ‘<span class="ital">because</span> they are.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These three verses (19–21) shew that <span class="ital">before</span> the Incarnation there were two classes of men in the world; a majority of evil-doers, whose antecedents led them to shun the Messiah; and a small minority of righteous, whose antecedents led them to welcome the Messiah. They had been given to Him by the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm" title="All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.">John 6:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-6.htm" title="I have manifested your name to the men which you gave me out of the world: your they were, and you gave them me; and they have kept your word.">John 17:6</a>); they recognised His teaching as of God, because they desired to do God’s will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm" title="If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.">John 7:17</a>). Such would be Simeon, Anna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36</a>), Nathanael, the disciples, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We have no means of knowing how Nicodemus was affected by this interview, beyond the incidental notices of him <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/7-50.htm" title="Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)...">John 7:50-51</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm" title="And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.">John 19:39</a>, which being so incidental shew that he is no fiction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/john/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm" title="But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.">John 3:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ ποιῶν</span>, <span class="ital">who does</span>) <span class="greekheb">Ποιεῖν</span> is often used of continuous zeal; as with the Latins, <span class="ital">mercaturam facere</span>, etc.—<span class="greekheb">φανερωθῇ</span>, <span class="ital">may be made manifest</span>) Even Nicodemus subsequently acted <span class="ital">more openly</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἔργα</span>—<span class="greekheb">εἰργασμένα</span>) Words akin [conjugate].—<span class="greekheb">ἐν Θεῷ</span>, <span class="ital">in God</span>) in the light, by the virtue [the power] and love of Him, from whom cometh all <span class="ital">truth</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he that doeth the truth</span> - who is "of the truth," and "heareth his voice" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>), he who is "morally true," inwardly sincere, who would never shrink from a genuine self-revelation - <span class="cmt_word">cometh to the light.</span> This remarkable expression allies itself with many other words of Christ, and suggests that in the heart of Judaism and of mankind generally, amid and notwithstanding the darkness which prevailed, there were found elect souls, taught of the Spirit, longing for more light, yearning to know the truth about themselves, however humiliating it might prove to be. This is confirmed by St. Paul's argument (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1</a> and 2), where some Gentiles who have not the Law are admitted to do by nature the things contained in the Law, and even to become a law unto themselves; and where, in contradistinction to the hopelessly rebellious, Paul assumes that there are some who "by patient continuance in well doing, seek for glory, honour, and immortality." These "do the truth, and have no pleasure in unrighteousness." They are "taught of God," they have "seen and heard from the Father" some of the great things of the Law. The Holy Spirit has opened their eyes to see great things in the Law, and they come to the light. They are not afraid of the revelation it will make. They may be humbled and pained by the disclosure, but there is a Divine luxury in such pain. The purpose of the coming to the light on the part of one who doeth the truth, is <span class="cmt_word">in order that his works may be made manifest.</span> This is the precise contrary of the conduct of the man whose eye is scaled and whose heart is made fat by sin. Such a one dreads <span class="accented">conviction</span>, the outward affirmation or utterance of the inwardly known <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; and therefore shrinks from conviction or any conduct which will promote it. He flees from the man of God, he disdains the revealing Word, he rejects the blessed Christ, he loves the darkness, this <span class="accented">is</span> his condemnation. On the other hand, the sincere man, who is honest with himself, is supremely anxious for the true light to bear down upon his "works." He is willing that they should be manifested. If he is deceiving himself with false hopes, he yearns that these should disappear before the shining of the true light. If his works will bear examination, then let him know the verdict which is unconsciously being given by the revelation of the light. It is a nice question to determine the meaning of the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. The current interpretation is for, or <span class="cmt_word">because, they are wrought in God;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sincere man desires this self-manifestation, comes to the light because his works have been inwrought by Divine grace. He loves the light, he does the truth <span class="accented">because</span> God has wrought within him to will and to do. In other words, the work of grace is in every case the adequate explanation of such a contrast to the common condition of human nature. Godet suggests that <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> here has the meaning of "that," and urges that the Greek usage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a> and other passages will justify the translation, <span class="accented">he cometh</span>...  <span class="accented">manifest, that they are wrought in God</span>, as though this Divine revelation were the real end of his coming to the light. This appears to me to be incompatible with the fact. The man who doeth the truth may yet need very much instruction before he accepts the Divine Original of his own conduct, or desires the manifestation to others of the Divine Source of his humble search. The more current translation, "because," is in harmony with the facts of Christian and religious experience, and is in keeping with the biblical assurance, that all good, all holiness, sincerity, and upright striving, just such as Nicodemus was then displaying, is God's own work, and is the result of his grace. Nicodemus comes, asks questions, receives weighty answers, and retires. We do not know the immediate result of these most wonderful words upon him; but we do find him taking the part of Jesus before the Sanhedrin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-50.htm">John 7:50, 51</a>); and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a> we learn that, though a secret disciple, he did not disdain to come out of his hiding place to houour the corpse of the Crucified. The death of Jesus, which had blasted the hopes of the apostles, had fired those of Nicodemus. Every word of this discourse is compatible with the position of the great Prophet at this early period of his ministry, is suited to the Pharisaic mind, and adapted to meet its difficulties and  correct its prejudices. If a few expressions, such as "the only begotten Son," "this is the condemnation, that," "he that doeth the truth," are found in writings which are John's undoubted composition, the circumstance may be explained that he borrowed them from Jesus. This is quite as rational (not to say legitimate and reverential) as to suppose, because of them, that John invented them, and betrayed their origin by placing them in the lips of Jesus. We do not suppose that John has mechanically recited the whole of the words that were spoken on either side, but preserved those heads of discourse which rise like mountain peaks above the oceans of thought between them, and are linked together by the glory which they severally reflect from the sublime personality of the Son of man. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Doeth the truth (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>The phrase occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-6.htm">1 John 1:6</a>. Note the contrasted phrase, doeth evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>). There the plural is used: doeth evil things; evil being represented by a number of bad works. Here the singular, the truth, or truth; truth being regarded as one, and "including in a supreme unity all right deeds." There is also to be noted the different words for doing in these two verses: doeth evil (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;); doeth truth (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;). The latter verb contemplates the object and end of action; the former the means, with the idea of continuity and repetition. &#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; is the practice, while &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; may be the doing once for all. Thus &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; is to conclude a peace: &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, to negotiate a peace. So Demosthenes: "He will do (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;) these things, and will accomplish them (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)." In the New Testament a tendency is observable to use &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; in a good sense, and &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; in an evil sense. Compare the kindred word &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, deed or work, which occurs six times, and in four out of the six of evil doing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-51.htm">Luke 23:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-18.htm">Acts 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-14.htm">Romans 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>). With this passage compare especially <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-29.htm">John 5:29</a>, where the two verbs are used with the two nouns as here. Also, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-15.htm">Romans 7:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-19.htm">Romans 7:19</a>. Bengel says: "Evil is restless: it is busier than truth." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-3.htm">Romans 2:3</a>, both verbs are used of doing evil, but still with a distinction in that &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; is the more comprehensive term, designating the pursuit of evil as the aim of the activity. <p>Cometh to<p>In contrast with hateth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>).
