Divine in origin, divine in nature, He is divine in teaching. That teaching, too, is a witness of things seen and heard. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-11.htm" title="And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.">John 6:11-12</a>.) It was a message from the Father’s home, brought by the Son Himself. His own message was but that of a servant who did not fully know its meaning.<p><span class= "bld">No man receiveth his testimony.</span>—These words are shown by those which immediately follow to <span class= "ital">go</span> in their pathos beyond the strict limit of the facts present to his own mind. Yet he may well have said “no man.” Of the crowds that thronged to his own baptism, of those who were then thronging to the baptism of Jesus, how many were there who were receiving like testimony of the things seen and heard? (Comp. again <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you receive not our witness.">John 3:11</a>.) How great the first promise, how bitter the last disappointment, of the Baptist’s life! These words of intense feeling are not to be measured by the cold standard of a formal exactness. And still it may be that the sadness of his tone arises from the fact that of those to whom he speaks, and at the time when he speaks, there was literally no one receiving this testimony, but all were seeking to make the earthly teacher a rival of the divine. The tense is present; those in the next verse are past.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/john/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-32.htm" title="And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony....">John 3:32-34</a></span>. <span class="ital">And what he hath seen and heard </span>— This is spoken in allusion to what was said in the preceding verse, of his being from above, where he enjoyed the most intimate communications of the divine counsels; <span class="ital">that he testifieth </span>— Clearly, fully, and faithfully; <span class="ital">and no man receiveth his testimony </span>— That is, very few receive it, particularly concerning the spiritual nature of the kingdom of God, and the qualifications requisite in his subjects. There is a strong resemblance between this and what our Lord himself said to Nicodemus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-11.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you receive not our witness....">John 3:11-13</a>. <span class="ital">He that hath received his testimony </span>— That hath understood and believed it; <span class="ital">hath set to his seal that God is true </span>— Hath made a most just and substantial acknowledgment of the veracity of God, who by his prophets in ancient times foretold what the nature of his kingdom under the Messiah would be, and who speaks to men now by his only-begotten Son, in such a manner as he never did by any other prophet. As <span class="ital">sealing </span>was employed for vouching the authenticity of writings, <span class="ital">to seal </span>came, by a natural and easy transition, to signify, <span class="ital">to vouch, to attest. </span>Our acceptance of God’s message by his Son, through an unshaken faith, vouches on our part the faithfulness of God, and the truth of his promises. <span class="ital">For he whom God hath sent </span>— His only-begotten Son; <span class="ital">speaketh the words of God </span>— Declareth doctrines which ought to be regarded as divine oracles, showing themselves to be such by their own native light of truth, and proved to be such by a great variety of the most extraordinary miracles. <span class="ital">For God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him</span> — Or, under such limitations, and with such interruptions, as he hath given, or still gives, that blessed gift to all his other messengers; but it dwells in him by a constant presence, and operates through him by a perpetual and unprecedented energy. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:22-36 John was fully satisfied with the place and work assigned him; but Jesus came on a more important work. He also knew that Jesus would increase in honour and influence, for of his government and peace there would be no end, while he himself would be less followed. John knew that Jesus came from heaven as the Son of God, while he was a sinful, mortal man, who could only speak about the more plain subjects of religion. The words of Jesus were the words of God; he had the Spirit, not by measure, as the prophets, but in all fulness. Everlasting life could only be had by faith in Him, and might be thus obtained; whereas all those, who believe not in the Son of God, cannot partake of salvation, but the wrath of God for ever rests upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And what he hath seen ... - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11</a>.<p>No man receiveth his testimony - The words "no man" are here to be understood in the sense of "few." Though his doctrine is pure, plain, sublime, yet "few," comparatively, received it in faith. Though multitudes came to him, drawn by various motives <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26</a>, yet "few" became his "real" disciples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-56.htm">Matthew 26:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>.<p>His testimony - His doctrine.

The Baptist here virtually says, Would it were so, but alas! they are next to "none" [Bengel]. They were far readier to receive himself, and obliged him to say, I am not the Christ, and he seems pained at this.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Another great difference which the Baptist teacheth his disciples to put between his testimony and Christ’s, is, that he, and so all other ministers of the gospel, testify by revelation; Christ testifieth not by revelation, but from his own personal knowledge, what himself <span class="ital">hath seen and heard</span> from his Father. See <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you receive not our witness.">John 3:11</a></span>, where our Saviour had spoken to Nicodemus much the same.

By these two terms is signified the most certain and infallible knowledge of those things which he testified, which made them worthy of all acceptation: but yet very few received his testimony, so as to believe in it: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm" title="He came to his own, and his own received him not.">John 1:11</a> 3:11</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And what he hath seen and heard,.... Of the Father, of his mind and will, of his purposes and promises, of his love, grace, and mercy, in the council and covenant of peace, lying in his bosom, and being privy to all his secrets. The phrases express the clear and perfect knowledge Christ has of all truths and doctrines; he having all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge in him. <p>That he testifieth; fully, freely, and faithfully; withholds nothing, but declares the whole counsel of God; and is deservedly called the faithful witness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>. <p>And no man receiveth his testimony; though it was the testimony of God, which is greater than that of man; yet few, and which were next to none at all, gave any heed or credit to it; few or none among the Jews, or among the disciples of John, or even among those that followed Christ. John, and his disciples, widely differed; they thought that all men came to Christ, and believed in him; and John thought few or none, in comparison of the numbers he could have wished, did: and indeed, no one person can receive the testimony of Christ, and believe in him, unless it be given him from above, by the grace of God: for the natural man receives not divine and spiritual things; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And what he hath <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> seen and heard, that he testifieth; and <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> no man receiveth his testimony.</span><p>(z) What he knows fully and perfectly.<p>(a) That is, very few.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/john/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-32.htm" title="And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony.">John 3:32</a>. The result is <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἑώρακε</span> … <span class="greekheb">μαρτυρεῖ</span>. Seeing and hearing are equivalent to having direct knowledge.

The <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> which connects the clauses implies the meaning “and yet”. This statement could not have been made when crowds were thronging to Jesus’ baptism. They are the reflection of the evangelist, who sees how sporadically the testimony of Christ has been received. Yet it has not been universally rejected: <span class="greekheb">ὁ λαβὼν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀληθής ἐστιν</span>. He who received His testimony sealed that God is true. <span class="greekheb">σφραγ</span>. means to stamp with approval, to endorse, to give confirmation. Wetstein quotes from Aristides, <span class="ital">Platonic.</span>, i., p. 18: <span class="greekheb">Αἰσχίνης μαρτυρεῖ Πλάτωνι</span> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὴν τοῦδε μαρτυρίαν ὥσπερ ἐπισφραγίζεται</span>. But he who believes Christ not only confirms or approves Christ’s truthfulness, but God’s. <span class="greekheb">ὃν γὰρ ἀπέστειλεν</span> … <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖ</span>. For Christ is God’s ambassador and speaks God’s words. This is a thought which pervades this Gospel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-26.htm" title="I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.">John 8:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-5.htm" title="I am the vine, you are the branches: He that stays in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.">John 15:5</a>, etc. “He that sent me,” or “the Father that sent me,” is a phrase occurring over twenty times in the Gospel and is characteristic of the aspect of Christ presented in it, as revealing the Father.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/john/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>. <span class="ital">what he hath seen and heard</span>] In His pre-existence with God; <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you receive not our witness.">John 3:11</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>.

Westcott, who regards these words as the free reflections of the evangelist, thinks that reference is being made to the continued testimony of the Church as the voice of Christ; but the spirit of the passage is obscured by this interpretation. The living present vocal testimony of Christ is being throughout contrasted with that of John. <span class="cmt_word">And no man receiveth his witness.</span> This seems in direct antagonism to the language of the disciples, "All men come to him;" and to John's own language, "He must increase." Westcott regards it, again, as the melancholy reflection of the aged apostle towards the close of the century. This seems to me to be an inadequate explanation. The reception of the witness of Christ had moved the whole world when John wrote his Gospel; and it would be inconsistent with the tone of exhilaration with which the evangelist closes his work. The forerunner may, however, have used this strong expression in purposed contrast to the jealous language of his own followers. "No man" - in comparison with the multitudes who ought to have already accepted him as the Son of God, as the heavenly Bridegroom. The concourse who crowded to the baptism of Jesus for a little moment did not blind the Baptist to the persistent and malignant opposition which awaited Jesus. "His joy  (ver. 29) and his grief (ver. 32) both formed a noble contrast to the jealousy of his own disciples" (Meyer). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Receiveth (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Once only John uses &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; for receive, of the Galilaeans receiving Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-45.htm">John 4:45</a>). The distinction between the two is not sharply maintained, but &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; commonly adds to the idea of taking, that of welcoming. Thus Demosthenes says that the Theban elders did not receive (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;) i.e., with a welcome pleasure, the money which was offered them, nor did they take it (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;). &#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; also includes the retaining of what is taken. Hence of receiving Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>). The phrase receive the witness is peculiar to John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-11.htm">John 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-34.htm">John 5:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-9.htm">1 John 5:9</a>). </body></html>
