The name into which Christ's disciples were baptized, is that which they will live and die by. It is a comfort to the greatest sufferers, if they suffer for Christ's name's sake. The world's ignorance is the true cause of its hatred to the disciples of Jesus. The clearer and fuller the discoveries of the grace and truth of Christ, the greater is our sin if we do not love him and believe in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And spoken unto them - Declared unto them the will of God, and made known his requirements. Jesus had not less certainly shown by his own arguments that he was the Messiah than by his miracles. By both these kinds of proof their guilt was to be measured. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm">John 15:26</a>. No small part of the gospel of John consists of arguments used by the Saviour to convince the Jews that he came from God. He here says if he had not used these arguments, and proved to them his divine mission, they had not had sin.<p>Had not had sin - This is evidently to be understood of the particular sin of persecuting and rejecting him. Of this he was speaking; and though, if he had not come, they would have been guilty of many other sins, yet of this, their great crowning sin, they would not have been guilty. We may understand this, then, as teaching:<p>1. That they would not have been guilty of this kind of sin. They would not have been chargeable with rejecting the signal grace of God if Jesus had not come and made an offer of mercy to them.<p>2. They would not have been guilty of the same degree of sin. The rejection of the Messiah was the crowning act of rebellion which brought down the vengeance of God, and led on their special national calamities. By way of eminence, therefore, this might be called the sin - the special sin of their age and nation. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/23-34.htm">Matthew 23:34-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-25.htm">Matthew 27:25</a>. And this shows us, what is so often taught in the Scriptures, that our guilt will be in proportion to the light that we possess and the mercies that we reject, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/11-20.htm">Matthew 11:20-24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47-48</a>. If it was such a crime to reject the Saviour then, it is a crime now; and if the rejection of the Son of God brought such calamities on the Jewish nation, the same rejection will involve the sinner now in woe, and vengeance, and despair.<p>No cloak - No covering, no excuse. The proof has been so clear that they cannot plead ignorance; it has been so often presented that they cannot allege that they had no opportunity of knowing it. It is still so with all sinners. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-25.

Ignorance of the will of God will not excuse sinners wholly, but it will excuse them in part. And this last seemeth to be the sense of the words by the latter part of the verse, because it is opposed to a having no cloak nor excuse for their sin. If Christ had not come in his incarnation, in his preaching the gospel, &c, they could not have been guilty of that hatred and malice which they showed against him, which was their greatest guilt; and they would have had this to say, Lord, we knew not what Christ was, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-44.htm" title="Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you an hungered, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you?">Matthew 25:44</a></span>: but now, saith our Saviour, they have no cloak, no colour, no pretence; I am come, I have revealed my Father’s mind and will to them, yet they will not receive me; no, though I have done those works before them which no man ever did, nor could do but by a Divine power. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If I had not come and spoken unto them,....

Our Lord could not have spoken of the hatred of himself or his disciples (so Lucke and Meyer) as this sin, because it would have been obviously impossible to hate a non-existent revelation or revealer. It is the deeper fall which is consequent upon a deliberate rejection of the highest love. Formerly, they would have been in the condition of those whose sins of ignorance God overlooks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>), and to whose <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in the past God has exercised <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in anticipation of the coming grace. <span class="cmt_word">But now</span> (Luke in numerous places uses this expression to form a strong contrast) <span class="cmt_word">they have no excuse</span> or pretext <span class="cmt_word">for their sin</span>, or concerning their sin. They can plead no justification. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is an <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and is not "cloak or covering," but "<span class="accented">palliation</span> or excuse" for manifest sin. So long as men have seen no deeper into the nature of God than they can go with the aid of mere phenomena or ratiocination on the details of creation, their fears and even their hatreds formulated into grim legend, or uncouth idols, or repellent hypothesis, are a natural outcome of a nature so corrupt; but they ought to have found in Christ a deeper revelation, a summons to service and adoring love. In rejecting the idea of God which I have set before them they have no excuse. St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>) declares that those who have defamed the great characteristic of God which may be learned from nature are without excuse. Certainly our Lord does not say this here. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Had sin (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>.<p>Cloke (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>From &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;, before, in front of, and &#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;, to say or affirm. Hence something which is placed in front of the true cause of a thing, a pretext. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-30.htm">Acts 27:30</a>. Pretext carries the same idea, Latin, proetextum, something woven in front, with a view to concealment or deception. Rev., excuse. Wyc, excusation. The A.V. follows Tyndale: nothing to cloke their sin withal. Latimer ("Sermons"): "By such cloaked charity, when thou dost offend before Christ but once, thou hast offended twice herein." The word appears in the low Latin cloca, a bell (compare the French cloche, and English clock), and the name was given to a horseman's cloak because of its resemblance to a bell. The word palliate is from the Latin pallium, a cloak. </body></html>
