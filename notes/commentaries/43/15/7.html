They will, especially, ask spiritual blessings, which they know it is his will they should ask and receive; and will ask them in the way which he hath prescribed, namely, sincerely, earnestly, importunately, and perseveringly; and in the way of repentance, faith, and new obedience; and, in the name of Christ, relying for the success of their petitions on the mediation of Christ, and the mercy and promise of God through him. And, with respect to temporal blessings, they will ask them conditionally, and with entire resignation, desiring to receive them only so far as God foresees will be for their good and his glory. 2d, That they shall always have such an interest in Christ’s sacrifice and intercession, and in God’s favour through him, that all their prayers shall be accepted, and their petitions granted in the degree, time, and manner in which they themselves desire they should be granted, namely, when and as far as God sees will be for their good: which is all they desire; for they would not wish their requests to be granted to their own hurt, the hurt of others, or God’s dishonour. Thus <span class="ital">the desire of the righteous shall be granted, </span>and God <span class="ital">will fulfil the desire of them that </span>truly and consistently <span class="ital">fear him: he also will hear their prayer, </span>and <span class="ital">will save</span> <span class="ital">them, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-24.htm" title="The fear of the wicked, it shall come on him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.">Proverbs 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-19.htm" title="He will fulfill the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.">Psalm 145:19</a>.

They accordingly paraphrase the passage thus; <span class="ital">If ye abide in me, </span>in the sincere profession and practice of my religion; <span class="ital">and my words abide in you, </span>if ye faithfully teach mankind my doctrines and precepts, notwithstanding the difficulties you may meet with in this work; <span class="ital">ye shall ask what ye will, </span>&c., ye may ask any miracle you please, in confirmation of your authority, and it shall be granted unto you.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/john/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-8 Jesus Christ is the Vine, the true Vine. The union of the human and Divine natures, and the fulness of the Spirit that is in him, resemble the root of the vine made fruitful by the moisture from a rich soil. Believers are branches of this Vine. The root is unseen, and our life is hid with Christ; the root bears the tree, diffuses sap to it, and in Christ are all supports and supplies. The branches of the vine are many, yet, meeting in the root, are all but one vine; thus all true Christians, though in place and opinion distant from each other, meet in Christ. Believers, like the branches of the vine, are weak, and unable to stand but as they are borne up. The Father is the Husbandman. Never was any husbandman so wise, so watchful, about his vineyard, as God is about his church, which therefore must prosper. We must be fruitful. From a vine we look for grapes, and from a Christian we look for a Christian temper, disposition, and life. We must honour God, and do good; this is bearing fruit. The unfruitful are taken away. And even fruitful branches need pruning; for the best have notions, passions, and humours, that require to be taken away, which Christ has promised to forward the sanctification of believers, they will be thankful, for them. The word of Christ is spoken to all believers; and there is a cleansing virtue in that word, as it works grace, and works out corruption. And the more fruit we bring forth, the more we abound in what is good, the more our Lord is glorified. In order to fruitfulness, we must abide in Christ, must have union with him by faith. It is the great concern of all Christ's disciples, constantly to keep up dependence upon Christ, and communion with him. True Christians find by experience, that any interruption in the exercise of their faith, causes holy affections to decline, their corruptions to revive, and their comforts to droop. Those who abide not in Christ, though they may flourish for awhile in outward profession, yet come to nothing. The fire is the fittest place for withered branches; they are good for nothing else. Let us seek to live more simply on the fulness of Christ, and to grow more fruitful in every good word and work, so may our joy in Him and in his salvation be full.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My words - My doctrine; my commandments.<p>Abide in you - Not only are remembered, but are suffered to remain in you as a living principle, to regulate your affections and life.<p>Ye shall ask ... - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13</a>. This promise had particular reference to the apostles. It is applicable to other Christians only so far as they are in circumstances similar to the apostles, and only so far as they possess their spirit. We learn from it that it is only when we keep the commandments of Christ - only when we live by faith in him, and his words are suffered to control our conduct and affections, that our prayers will be heard.

Abiding in Christ is here explained by his words or doctrines abiding in his disciples; by which are meant his Gospel, and the truths of it. This abides when it comes in power, and becomes the engrafted word; and may be said to do so, when such, in whose hearts it has a place, and has taken deep root, continue to have a relish and savour of it, a true and hearty affection for it, esteeming it above their necessary food; when they hold fast the profession of it, stand fast in it, steadfastly abide by it, and constantly attend on it; all which is a considerable evidence that they do, yea, there is a promise that they "shall continue in the Son and in the Father", <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm">1 John 2:24</a>; The blessing and privilege that such shall enjoy is, <p>ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you; or, as some copies read it, "it shall be given you": but this must be understood not of temporal things, as riches, honours, profits, pleasures, or whatever even the carnal mind of a believer himself may sometimes desire; but of things spiritual, and with such limitations and restrictions as these; whatever is according to the will of God, for the Spirit of God himself asks for no other for the saints; whatever is for the glory of God, and for their own spiritual profit and edification; and whatever is agreeably to the words and doctrines of Christ, which abide in them. Every thing of this kind they ask in faith, and with a submission to the divine will, they may expect to receive. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</span><p>(2) Whoever rests in Christ's doctrine abides in him, and therefore brings forth good fruit, and the Father will not deny anything to such a person as this.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-7.htm" title="If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done to you.">John 15:7</a>.

The disciples may be sorely distressed at this possible doom, for whatever may be the lot of those who do not obey the gospel and are ignorant of the Law of God, the curse here uttered fails heavily upon those who have been once enlightened, etc., and have apostatized (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a>). The anxiety of the apostles ]s grievous, and they desire deliverance from this doom. And our Lord next unfolds the principle of prayer which laid such hold on the mind of the Apostle John: If ye abide in me (and <span class="accented">then</span>, instead of adding, "And I abide in you," he says); <span class="cmt_word">and my words abide in you</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if my teaching so abide with you as to control your thoughts and ideas, remain in you as your guide and inspiration, then <span class="cmt_word">ask</span> <span class="cmt_word">whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done to you.</span> A timid interpretation of this promise limits the "whatsoever" to deeds of service in the kingdom of God, and fears, with Augustine, to trust the sanctified will of the believer. But in such harmony with Christ as these words supply, all the conditions of acceptable prayer are present. The believer in Christ, full of his words, evermore consciously realizing union with Christ, charged with the thoughts, burning with the purposes, filled with words of Jesus, will have no will that is not in harmony with the Divine will. Then faith is possible in the fulfillment of his own desire, and prayer becomes a prophecy and pledge of the answer. The apostle, after many years of pondering and of putting these principles into practice, confirms the truth of them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14-16</a>). This is the true philosophy of prayer. The psalmist had gone a long way in the same direction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>, "Delight thyself in the Lord; and he shall give thee thy heart's desire"). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye shall ask (&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)<p>The best texts read the imperative, &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;, ask.<p>Shall be done unto you (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Literally, it shall come to pass for you. </body></html>
