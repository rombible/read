The name into which Christ's disciples were baptized, is that which they will live and die by. It is a comfort to the greatest sufferers, if they suffer for Christ's name's sake. The world's ignorance is the true cause of its hatred to the disciples of Jesus.

Which of these two cases will in general occur, Jesus leaves to the judgment of the disciples themselves, since they in truth knew from experience how it had gone with Him. To take the second clause <span class="ital">ironically</span> (“quasi dicat: non est, quod hoc speretis,” Grotius, Lampe), is appropriate neither to the seriousness of the first, nor to the tone of the whole passage. Olshausen’s view is incorrect (comp. B. Crusius, Maier, Godet), “if <span class="ital">many</span>, etc.,” where, in the first half, according to Godet, we should have to think of the <span class="ital">mass</span> of the people. But the variation of the subjects is a pure importation. Finally, when Bengel and other older expositors (in Wolf) interpret <span class="greekheb">τηρεῖν</span> as <span class="ital">watch</span>, this is quite opposed to the Johannean usage of <span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τηρεῖν</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.">John 8:51</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-23.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him....">John 14:23-24</a>, and frequently), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-10.htm" title="If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.">John 15:10</a>, and it would also be too weak a conception after the first half of the verse.

That He should speak of them as “servants” so shortly after calling them “friends,” shows how natural and appropriate both designations are, how truly service characterises His friends, and how He must at all times be looked upon as Supreme Lord. <span class="greekheb">εἰ ἐμὲ ἐδίωξαν</span> … <span class="greekheb">τηρήσουσιν</span>. “If they persecuted me, you also will they persecute; if they kept my word, yours too will they keep.” In so far as they are identified with Him, their experience will be identical with His. The attitude of the world does not alter.

The "if" is remarkably explicit; there is no doubt about it in Christ's case, and the supposition is one of definite and acknowledged fact, and the conditional sentence most positively assures them of antagonism and persecution. It is probable, though not certainly known, that these disciples all endured a living martyrdom, if not a cruel death in his cause. Then follows a sentence which has by some unwisely been supposed to be ironical, and by others to refer to another subject. <span class="cmt_word">If they</span> - others, or many, or some - <span class="cmt_word">kept</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "observed," "obeyed," not as Bengel supposed, "laid in wait," or "kept maliciously") <span class="cmt_word">my word, they will keep yours also</span> Why should irony be interpolated here? Surely the whole con[act with the world was not an utter failure. Christ did win persons from all classes, and they loved him, with a passionate love; and so the apostles, and all who "go forth to bear fruit," may hope for some victories, and will travail in birth with the souls of men. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Persecuted (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>The verb means originally to put to flight; thence to run swiftly in order to overtake or attain, as the goal or the competitor in the race. Thus Sophocles ("Electra," 738): "He urged his swift steeds vehemently with shouts that pierced their ears, and makes for him (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)." Compare I follow after (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>). Hence to pursue with hostile intent, and, generally, to molest, harass, persecute. Persecute is from the equivalent Latin persequor, to follow up, and is used earlier, in the sense of pursue, while pursue, in turn, is used in the sense of persecute. Thus Wyc, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>, for men pursuing you. Sir Thomas More ("Utopia"), "Whiles their enemies rejoicing in the victory have persecuted (i.e., pursued) them." </body></html>
