The union of the human and Divine natures, and the fulness of the Spirit that is in him, resemble the root of the vine made fruitful by the moisture from a rich soil. Believers are branches of this Vine. The root is unseen, and our life is hid with Christ; the root bears the tree, diffuses sap to it, and in Christ are all supports and supplies. The branches of the vine are many, yet, meeting in the root, are all but one vine; thus all true Christians, though in place and opinion distant from each other, meet in Christ. Believers, like the branches of the vine, are weak, and unable to stand but as they are borne up. The Father is the Husbandman. Never was any husbandman so wise, so watchful, about his vineyard, as God is about his church, which therefore must prosper. We must be fruitful. From a vine we look for grapes, and from a Christian we look for a Christian temper, disposition, and life. We must honour God, and do good; this is bearing fruit. The unfruitful are taken away. And even fruitful branches need pruning; for the best have notions, passions, and humours, that require to be taken away, which Christ has promised to forward the sanctification of believers, they will be thankful, for them. The word of Christ is spoken to all believers; and there is a cleansing virtue in that word, as it works grace, and works out corruption. And the more fruit we bring forth, the more we abound in what is good, the more our Lord is glorified. In order to fruitfulness, we must abide in Christ, must have union with him by faith. It is the great concern of all Christ's disciples, constantly to keep up dependence upon Christ, and communion with him. True Christians find by experience, that any interruption in the exercise of their faith, causes holy affections to decline, their corruptions to revive, and their comforts to droop. Those who abide not in Christ, though they may flourish for awhile in outward profession, yet come to nothing. The fire is the fittest place for withered branches; they are good for nothing else. Let us seek to live more simply on the fulness of Christ, and to grow more fruitful in every good word and work, so may our joy in Him and in his salvation be full.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/john/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Herein - In this - to wit, in your bearing much fruit.<p>Glorified - Honored.<p>Bear much fruit - Are fruitful in good works; are faithful, zealous, humble, devoted, always abounding in the work of the Lord. This honors God.<p>1. Because it shows the excellence of his law which requires it.<p>2. Because it shows the power of his gospel, and of that grace which can overcome the evil propensities of the heart and produce it.<p>3. Because the Christian is restored to the divine image, and it shows how excellent is the character after which they are formed. They imitate God, and the world sees that the whole tendency of the divine administration and character is to make man holy; to produce in us that which is lovely, and true, and honest, and of good report. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-20.htm">Matthew 7:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>.<p>So - That is, in doing this.<p>Shall ye be my disciples - This is a true test of character. It is not by profession, but it is by a holy life, that the character is tried. This is a test which it is easy to apply, and one which decides the case. It is worthy of remark that the Saviour says that those who bear much fruit are they who are his disciples. The design and tendency of his religion is to excite men to do much good, and to call forth all their strength, and time, and talents in the work for which the Saviour laid down his life. Nor should anyone take comfort in the belief that he is a Christian who does not aim to do much good, and who does not devote to God all that he has in an honest effort to glorify his name, and to benefit a dying world. The apostles obeyed this command of the Saviour, and went forth preaching the gospel everywhere, and aiming to bring all men to the knowledge of the truth; and it is this spirit only, manifested in a proper manner, which can constitute any certain evidence of piety. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/john/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. glorified that ye bear much fruit&#8212;not only from His delight in it for its own sake, but as from "the juices of the Living Vine."<p>so shall ye be my disciples&#8212;evidence your discipleship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/john/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here are two arguments to press his disciples’ abiding in him, that so they might bring forth much fruit. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Herein</span> (saith our Saviour) <span class="bld">is my Father glorified.</span> The glorifying of God is the great end of our lives, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-31.htm" title="Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.">1 Corinthians 10:31</a></span>.

According to the different nature of plants they bring forth various fruits, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-16.htm" title="You shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?...">Matthew 7:16-18</a></span>. Hence we read of the fruit of sin unto death, and the fruit of righteousness unto life. The first is every man’s natural fruit, until he be ingrafted into Christ: being ingrafted into him, the soul having a new nature given to it, being regenerated and renewed by the Holy Ghost, it no longer bringeth forth fruit from its old principle, and according to its old nature, but from its new principle, and according to its new nature. As the cultivated earth, that is ploughed and harrowed, doth not bring forth weeds and ordinary grass, according to its nature, but bringeth forth fruit according to the seed that is cast into it, yet not without the influence of heaven, both with respect to the dew of it, and the warmth which it hath from the sun; so the soul, being regenerated, the fallow ground of it being ploughed up, and the seed of righteousness being sown in it, no more brings forth the weeds of lusts and corruptions, or only ordinary acts of human nature, but it brings forth fruits according to its new nature, and the new seed of the word now sown in it, and dwelling in it. And look, as it tendeth to the honour of the husbandman, when the ground by him ploughed and manured brings forth much fruit; so it tendeth to the honour and glory of God, when the souls renewed, manured, and influenced by him, bring forth much of the fruit of righteousness and holiness. And though men must be Christ’s disciples before they bring forth any fruit, yet their bringing forth much fruit is that which alone can evidence and make them appear to be the disciples of Christ. And often in Scripture being signifieth appearing, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm" title="Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If you continue in my word, then are you my disciples indeed;">John 8:31</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm" title="God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.">Romans 3:4</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/john/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Herein is my Father glorified,.... This does not so much refer to what goes before, concerning the disciples abiding in Christ, and he and his words abiding in them, and doing for them whatever they ask, though by all this God is glorified; as to what follows, the fruitfulness of the disciples: <p>that ye bear much fruit; of doctrine, grace, and good works, which show them to be trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, and the work of his hands; wherein the glory of his power, grace, and mercy, is greatly displayed. All the fruits of righteousness, with which they were filled by Christ, were by him to the praise and glory of God; yea, by the fruitfulness of grace, and of life and conversation, by the lively exercise of grace, and conscientious discharge of duty, as well by light of doctrine, and usefulness in the ministration of the Gospel, the disciples and servants of Christ not only glorify God themselves, but are the means of others glorifying him. It follows, <p>so shall ye be my disciples; or "disciples to me"; to my honour and glory also, as well as to my Father's; not that their fruitfulness made them the disciples of Christ, but made them appear to be so, or made them honourable ones. Just as good fruit does not make the tree good; the tree is first good, and therefore it brings forth good fruit; but shows it to be good: as by continuing in his word, abiding by his Gospel they appeared to be "disciples indeed", <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-31.htm">John 8:31</a>, really and truly such; and as by loving one another, so by other fruits of righteousness, other men, all men know that they are the disciples of Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/john/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{a}</span> Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</span><p>(a) As one would say, Herein will my Father be glorified, and herein also will you be my disciples, if you bring forth much fruit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/john/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-8.htm" title="Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.">John 15:8</a>.

So LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-5.htm" title="And the officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is there that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it.">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>.—E. and T.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Here the Lord shows what he knows will be and must be the dominant desire of the man who abides in himself, in whom his own word abides. Such a man will seek, yearn, ask, that he should <span class="cmt_word">bear much fruit</span>. This prayer will be heard, and <span class="cmt_word">in this</span> sublime synthesis between Christ and his disciples, says Christ, <span class="cmt_word">was my Father glorified</span>. "In the fruitfulness of the vine is the glory of the husbandman," and in the answer of your prayers, and the regulation of all your desires, <span class="cmt_word">so ye shall become my disciples</span>. "Discipleship" is a very large word, never altogether realized. Just as faith leads to faith, and love to love, and light to light, so does discipleship to discipleship. As Bengel says, discipleship is the <span class="accented">fundamentum et fastigium</span> of Christianity. On earth the vine reveals itself in the branches, and thus conceals itself behind them. "This explains why the diffusion of spiritual life makes such slow progress in the world - the Vine effects nothing but by means of the branches, and these so often paralyze instead of promoting the action of the Vine" (Godet). If the other text be maintained, <span class="accented">Herein was my Father glorified</span>, <span class="accented">so that ye might bear much fruit</span>, <span class="accented">and that ye may become my disciples</span>, the "herein" points back to the previous verse, and then the contemplated result of the arrangement, rather than the purpose of the glory, is the matter referred to. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/john/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Herein (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;)<p>Commonly referred to what follows. My Father is glorified in this, namely, that ye bear much fruit. It is better to refer it back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-7.htm">John 15:7</a>. In the perfect unity of will between the Son and the disciple, which results in the disciple's obtaining whatever he asks, the Father is glorified. To this effect is <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13</a>, "Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son." The design of this glorification is that (&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;) you may bear much fruit. This retrospective reference of &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;, in this, or herein, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-37.htm">John 4:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-30.htm">John 16:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm">1 John 4:17</a>.<p>Is glorified (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>The aorist tense; was glorified. As in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>, marking the point when the Father's glory was realized in the perfect union of the believer's will with Christ's.<p>So shall ye be (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)<p>Literally, and ye shall become. Some editors, however, read &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;, and connect, in the same construction with the preceding clause, rendering, "Herein is (was) my Father glorified, that ye might bear much fruit and become my disciples." Note that the word is become, not be. Christian discipleship implies progress and growth. </body></html>
