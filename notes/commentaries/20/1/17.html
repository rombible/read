Thus understood, the sentence connects with the preceding verse, and contains an argument to enforce the caution given to the young man, to shun the misery and ruin in which his hearkening to the counsel of sinners would involve him. But the sentence is considered by many commentators as connected with the following verse, and is interpreted thus: The fowler who spreads his net in the sight of the bird, loses his labour; but these sinners are more foolish than the silly birds, for, though they are not ignorant of the mischief which these evil courses will bring upon themselves, yet they will not take warning. Thus Schultens paraphrases the words: “There is no bird so stupid as to fly into a net spread immediately before its eyes; but these abandoned sinners spread with their own hands, immediately before their own eyes, those nets by which they willingly involve themselves in certain death and ruin: for they who lay snares for the blood of the innocent, lay snares for themselves; and they who desire to swallow up the virtuous alive as the grave, they themselves will be swallowed up in that grave, and be plunged in destruction.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:10-19 Wicked people are zealous in seducing others into the paths of the destroyer: sinners love company in sin. But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? much less if he lose his soul?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Strictly speaking, this is the first proverb (i. e., similitude) in the book; a proverb which has received a variety of interpretations. The true meaning seems to be as follows: "For in vain, to no purpose, is the net spread out openly. Clear as the warning is, it is in vain. The birds still fly in. The great net of God's judgments is spread out, open to the eyes of all, and yet the doers of evil, willfully blind, still rush into it." Others take the words as pointing to the failure of the plans of the evil-doers against the innocent (the "bird"): others, again, interpret the proverb of the young man who thinks that he at least shall not fall into the snares laid for him, and so goes blindly into them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-19. Men warned ought to escape danger as birds instinctively avoid visibly spread nets. But stupid sinners rush to their own ruin (Ps 9:16), and, greedy of gain, succeed in the very schemes which destroy them (1Ti 6:10), not only failing to catch others, but procuring their own destruction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The design of these words is to set forth the folly of these men by the similitude of a bird, which yet is very variously applied and understood by divers interpreters. But I shall not confound the reader with the rehearsal of them. This clause, in vain, upon the understanding whereof the whole depends, may be understood, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. In respect of the fowler. So the sense is, The fowler who spreads his net in the sight of the bird loseth his labour, because the bird, perceiving the danger, will not be tempted to come to the bait, but flees away from it. <span class="ital">But</span>, or <span class="ital">yet</span>, these (as the first words of the next verse may well be, and by the Chaldee translator are, rendered) are more foolish than the silly birds; and though they are not ignorant of the danger and mischief which these evil courses will bring upon themselves, which I have here represented, yet they will not take warning, but madly rush upon their own ruin. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. In respect of the bird. So the sense is, The silly bird, although it see the spreading of the net, yet is not at all instructed and cautioned by it, but through the greediness of the bait rusheth upon it, and is taken by it. And these men are not one jot wiser, but albeit they know and find that by these practices they expose themselves to the justice of the magistrate, and to the vengeance of God, the sad effects whereof they daily see in the destruction of their brethren in iniquity, yet they will boldly and madly run themselves into the same miseries. Both ways the sense comes to the same, <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. Or "without cause" (y), as the word is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>; and so the words are an illustration of the preceding; showing that the blood of innocent persons is shed without cause, no injury being done by them to those that do it, but is shed without any provocation at all; just as the net is spread for the innocent bird, which has done no harm to the fowler that seeks to take it; so Gersom: or else the sense is, that though the net is spread by the fowler even in the sight of the bird, yet it is in vain to the bird, though not to the fowler; it is so intent upon the corn that is spread about, that it takes no notice of the net, and so is caught in it; and thus it is with those men that are bent upon their sinful practices, upon theft and murder, though their ruin and destruction are before their eyes; and they daily see their companions in iniquity come to an untimely end; they know that they are liable to suffer death by the hand of the civil magistrate, and to be followed by the justice and vengeance of God, and suffer eternal punishment; yet take no warning hereby, but rush on to their own ruin, as follows. <p>(y) "sine causa", Vatablus, Mercerus, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">in vain</span>] Because, whereas by the certain destruction which it portends, the net ought to deter the bird from yielding to the solicitations of appetite, the temptation of the bait prevails, and the warning of the visible net is unheeded. “So,” in their unheeding regard of manifest warning, “are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain” (). His devices against others (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/1-11.htm" title="If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privately for the innocent without cause:...">Proverbs 1:11-12</a></span>) are really devices against himself <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-18.htm" title="And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privately for their own lives.">Proverbs 1:18</a></span>. “In the net which they hid is their own foot taken” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-15.htm" title="The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.">Psalm 9:15</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely in vain the net is spread in the face of any bird.</span> The teacher here advances a <span class="accented">second</span> reason in support of his warning in ver. 15, under the form of a proverb in its strict sense. It is based on the ill-advised audacity of sinners in flying in the face of God's judgments. <span class="accented">In vain</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">khinnam</span>), see ver. 11, may be taken in two senses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> to no purpose, <span class="accented">gratis, frustra</span> (Vulgate, Chaldee Paraphrase, Arabic). The meaning of the proverb here used then is, "to no purpose is the net spread before birds," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though they see the net spread before them, they nevertheless fly into it (romp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-23.htm">Proverbs 7:23</a>, "As a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life"). So sinners, when they are plotting for others, plunge into their own destruction with their eyes open. Therefore do not associate with them, do not imitate their crass folly, be warned by their example, or you will share their fate. This view is supported by the LXX. reading, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, "For not unreasonably is the net spread before birds;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they fall into the snare (see Luther, Patrick, Umbreit, Ewatd, Hitzig, Zockler, Plumptre). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Others, as Delitzsch, Ziegler, Beda, Doderlein, Bertheau, Wardlaw, take <span class="accented">khinnam</span> in a different sense, as indicating the escape of the birds - the birds see the snare and fly away, and so in vain the net is spread in their sight. This explanation is in agreement with Ovid's statement, "Quae nimis apparent retia vitat avis." The moral motive put before youth in this case is the aggravation of his guilt if he listens to the enticements of sinners. The teacher seems to say, "Imitate the birds, flee from temptation; if you listen to sinners, you will sin with your eyes open." <span class="accented">Is spread</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">m</span> <span class="accented">zorah</span>)<span class="accented">, expansum</span>, not <span class="accented">conspersum est, i.e.</span> besprinkled or strewn with corn as a bait, as Rashi. <span class="accented">M'zorah</span> is the participle passive of pual, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">zorah</span>), "to be strewn," from kal <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">zarah</span>).

As in post-biblical Heb. &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1493;&#1491;&#1501; (or inverted, &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>), used of men as such, is not so used in the O.T., yet &#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, like &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, is sometimes used synecdochically for the person, but never with reference to the blood as an essentially constituent part of corporealness, but always with reference to violent putting to death, which separates the blood from the body (cf. my System der bibl. Psychologie, p. 242). Here &#1500;&#1491;&#1501; is explained by &#1500;&#1491;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, with which it is interchanged, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a> : let us lurk for blood (to be poured out). The verb &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; is never, like &#1496;&#1502;&#1503; (to conceal), connected with &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; ,&#1495;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;, &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; - thus none of these words is here to be supplied; the idea of gaining over one expressed in the organic root &#1510;&#1507; (whence &#1510;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, diducendo obducere) has passed over into that of restraining oneself, watching, lurking, hence &#1510;&#1508;&#1503; (cog. Aram. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503;) in the sense of speculari, insidiari, interchanges with &#1510;&#1508;&#1492; (to spy), (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-7.htm">Psalm 56:7</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-32.htm">Psalm 37:32</a>).
