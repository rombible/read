But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? much less if he lose his soul?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The temptation against which the teacher seeks to guard his disciple is that of joining a band of highway robbers.

So LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἀδίκως</span>. Others, less probably, take the adverb with the word “innocent”: for them who are innocent in vain (who serve God for nought, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-9.htm" title="Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?">Job 1:9</a>, where the Heb. word is the same as here), because, as we will soon shew, his innocency will profit him nothing. “Contra insontem frustra,” Vulg. “Pio nullum pietatis præmium habituro,” Maur.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood.</span> The teacher here puts into the mouth of the sinners, for the sake of vivid representation, the first inducement with which they seek to allure youth from the paths of rectitude, viz. privacy and concealment (Cartwright, Wardlaw). Both the verbs <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">arav</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, (<span class="accented">tzaphan</span>) mean "to lay in wait" (Zockler). The radical meaning of <span class="accented">arav</span>, from which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">neer'vah</span>), "let us lay in wait" (Authorized Version) is taken, is "to knot, to weave, to intertwine." Verbs of this class are often applied to snares and craftiness (cf. the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">insidias nectere</span>, "to weave plots, or lay snares"). Generally, <span class="accented">arav</span> is equivalent to "to watch in ambush" (Gesenius); cf. the Vulgate, <span class="accented">insidiemur sanguini</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let us lay wait for blood." The LXX. paraphrases the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let us share in blood." On the other hand, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaphan</span>), from which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nitz'p'nah</span>), translated in the Authorized Version, "let us lurk privily," is "to hide or conceal," and intrans. "to hide one's self," or ellipt., "to hide nets, snares" (Gesenius, Holden). This sense agrees with the Vulgate <span class="accented">abscondamus tendiculas</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "let us conceal snares." Delitzsch, however, holds that no word is to be understood with this verb, and traces the radical meaning to that of restraining one's self, watching, lurking. in the sense of <span class="accented">speculari</span>, "to watch for," <span class="accented">insidiari</span>, "to lay wait for." The two verbs combine what may be termed the apparatus, the arrangement of the plot and their lurking in ambush, by which they will await their victims. <span class="accented">For blood</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">l'dam</span>). The context (see vers. 12 and 16), bearing as it does upon bloodshed accompanying robbery, requires that the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">l'dam</span>) should be understood here, as Fleischer remarks, either elliptically, for "the blood of men," as the Jewish interpreters explain, or synedochically, for the person, with especial reference to his blood being shed, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-21.htm">Psalm 94:21</a>. Vatablus, Cornelius a Lapide. and Gesenius support the latter view (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>, "They all lie in wait for blood," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for bloodshed, or murder. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">dam</span>) may be also taken for life in the sense that "the blood is the life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-23.htm">Deuteronomy 12:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause.</span> The relation of the phrase. "without cause" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">khinnam</span>), in this sentence is a matter of lnueh dispute. It may be taken either with <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">verb</span> (as in the Authorized Version, Wordsworth, Luther, Van Ess, Noyes, Zockler, Delitzsch, Hatzig, LXX., Syriac, Rashi, Ralbac), and then "lurk privily without cause" is equivalent to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> without having any reason for revenge and enmity (Zockler), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> though they have not provoked us, nor done us any injury, yet let us hurt them, in the sense of <span class="accented">absque causa</span> (Munsterus, Paganini Version, Piscatoris Version, Mercerus), <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), <span class="accented">inique</span> (Arabic); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> with impunity, since none will avenge them in the sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-12.htm">Job 9:12</a> (this is the view of Lowestein, but it is rejected by Delitzsch); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it may be taken with the <span class="accented">adjective</span> "innocent," in which case it means him that is innocent in vain; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the man whose innocence will in vain protect (Zockler, Holden), who gets nothing by it (Plumptre), or, innocent in vain, since God does not vindicate hint (Cornelius a Lapide). On the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-31.htm">1 Samuel 25:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-4.htm">Psalm 69:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-52.htm">Lamentations 3:52</a>, it seems preferable to adopt the first connection, and to take the adverb with the verb. In the whole of the passage there is an evident allusion to an evil  prevalent in the age of Solomon, viz. the presence of bands of robbers, or banditti, who disturbed the security and internal peace of the country. In the New Testament the same state of things continued, and is alluded to by our Lord in the parable of the man who fell among thieves. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this verse the infinitives of the object pass into independent sentences for the sake of variety.
