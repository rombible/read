If young people take heed to their ways, according to Solomon's Proverbs, they will gain knowledge and discretion.

The "man of understanding" may gain "wise counsels," literally, the power to "steer" his course rightly on the dangerous seas of life.

With great attention, and hearken to the proverbs and wise sayings herein delivered; for here are many things entertaining to men of years and wisdom, as well as instructive to young men and simple ones; <p>and will increase learning; or "add" (k) to his stock of learning; or, as the Targum, <p>"will add knowledge;'' <p>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a>; or, "will be wiser", as the Vulgate Latin version. This is said to show the excellency of this book, and the extensive usefulness of it; indeed wise men will get knowledge where fools cannot, and increase learning where others can get none: there are few books but a wise man will get something out of; and especially such a book as this, and as the Scriptures are; <p>and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels; a man of a spiritual understanding arrives to the knowledge of the wise counsels of God; the doctrines of the Gospel, which are the "whole counsel" of God; are recondite wisdom, the hidden wisdom of God, which no wisdom of man is comparable to. It is the wisest scheme that was ever formed, and which the wit of man could never have devised, even salvation by Jesus Christ; and which was laid in God's "counsels of old", which are "faithfulness" and "truth"; the knowledge of which is attained unto by one that is spiritually wise. Moreover, a man that thoroughly understands the things contained in this book is fit to be a counsellor of others in things human and divine; in things moral, civil, and spiritual: he is fit to be in the cabinet council of princes, to be a counsellor of kings; yea, to have the reins of government in his hands. "He shall possess government"; so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions: or, "he shall possess the helm" (l); sit as a pilot there, as the word may signify, and steer the ship aright in which he is; whether it be his family, or the church of God, or a city or corporation, or a kingdom: this book, rightly understood by him, will furnish him with rules to do all things well and wisely. <p>(k) "addet", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus, Cocceius, Michaelis, Schultens.

Thus Umbreit and Elster, regarding the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">yish'ma</span>) as conditional, translate, "if the wise man hear;" on the other hand, Delitzsch and Zockler take it as voluntative," let the wise man hear," ete. The principle here enunciated is again stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-9.htm">Proverbs 9:9</a>, "Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser," and finds expression under the gospel economy in the words of our Lord, "For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>; cf. 25:29; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-25.htm">Mark 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-18.htm">Luke 8:18</a> and Mark 14:26). <span class="accented">Learning</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">lekakh</span>), in the sense of being transmitted or received (Gesenius, Delitzsch, Dunn). A man of understanding (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">intelligens</span>) is a person of intelligence who lays himself open to be instructed. <span class="accented">Wise counsels</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">takh'buloth</span>). This word is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">khevel</span>), a ship rope, a denominative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">khovel</span>), and only occurs in the plural. It signifies those maxims of prudence by which a man may direct his course aright through life (cf. <span class="accented">regimen</span>, Arabic). The imagery is taken from the management of a vessel, and is reproduced in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">gubernatio.</span> "Navigationi vitam comparat" (Mariana). The word is almost exclusively confined to the Proverbs, and occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-5.htm">Proverbs 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-18.htm">Proverbs 20:18</a>; and Proverbs 24:6, usually in a good sense, though it has the meaning of "stratagem" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-5.htm">Proverbs 12:5</a>. In the only other passage where it is found it is used of God's power in turning about the clouds; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-12.htm">Job 37:12</a>, "And it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the bright cloud] is turned round about by his counsels (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, <span class="accented">b'thakh'bulothau</span>)." It is the practical correlative of "learning," in the first part of the verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/150.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Synagogue reckons up thirteen divine attributes according to ex. Psa 34:6. (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1492; &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;), to which, according to an observation of Kimchi, correspond the thirteen &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; of this Psalm. It is, however, more probable that in the mind of the poet the tenfold halaluw encompassed by Hallelujah's is significative; for ten is the number of rounding off, completeness, exclusiveness, and of the extreme of exhaustibleness. The local definitions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-1.htm">Psalm 150:1</a> are related attributively to God, and designate that which is heavenly, belonging to the other world, as an object of praise. &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1493;&#1468; (the possible local meaning of which is proved by the &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; of the Tabernacle and of the Temple) is in this passage the heavenly &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;; and &#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493; is the firmament spread out by God's omnipotence and testifying of God's omnipotence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-35.htm">Psalm 68:35</a>), not according to its front side, which is turned towards the earth, but according to the reverse or inner side, which is turned towards the celestial world, and which marks it off from the earthly world. The third and fourth ha&#774;lalu give as the object of the praise that which is at the same time the ground of the praise: the tokens of His &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, i.e., of His all-subduing strength, and the plenitude of His greatness (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1493;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1493;), i.e., His absolute, infinite greatness. The fifth and sixth ha&#774;lalu bring into the concert in praise of God the ram's horn, &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;, the name of which came to be improperly used as the name also of the metallic &#1495;&#1510;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-4.htm">Psalm 81:4</a>), and the two kinds of stringed instruments (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>), viz., the nabla (i.e., the harp and lyre) and the kinnor (the cithern), the &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; and the &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; (&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;). The seventh ha&#774;lalu invites to the festive dance, of which the chief instrumental accompaniment is the &#1514;&#1468;&#1507; (Arabic duff, Spanish adufe, derived from the Moorish) or tambourine. The eighth ha&#774;lalu brings on the stringed instruments in their widest compass, &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>) from &#1502;&#1503;, Syriac men&#305;&#770;n, and the shepherd's pipe, &#1506;&#1490;&#1489; (with the Gimel raphe  equals  &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;); and the ninth and tenth, the two kinds of castanets (&#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;, construct form of &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, singular &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;), viz., the smaller clear-sounding, and the larger deeper-toned, more noisy kinds (cf. &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>), as &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; (pausal form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, like &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>, and frequently, from &#1505;&#1514;&#1512;  equals  &#1505;&#1514;&#1512;) and &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497; &#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; are, with Schlultens, Pfeifer, Burk, Kster, and others, to be distinguished. </body></html>
