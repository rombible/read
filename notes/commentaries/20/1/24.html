Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The threats and warnings of Wisdom are also foreshadowings of the teaching of Jesus.

This is to be understood not of the internal call of Wisdom, or Christ, which is by the special grace of his Spirit; is according to an eternal purpose, the fruit of everlasting love, peculiar to God's elect, and by a divine power; and is also a call to special blessings of grace, and to eternal glory; and which is always effectual, unchangeable, and irreversible, and can never be refused, rejected, and resisted, so as to become void and of no effect: but of the external call by the word, to the natural duties of religion, and to an attendance on the means of grace; which may be where no election goes before, no sanctification attends, nor salvation follows, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>; and this may be refused and rejected, as it often is; as when men, notwithstanding that call, do not attend on the ministry of the word, or, if they do, it is in a negligent careless way; or, they show an aversion to it, despise, contradict, and blaspheme it, as the Jews did, who were the persons first called to hear it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-2.htm">Matthew 22:2</a>; <p>I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; this is a gesture of persons calling to others, as orators and preachers, requiring silence and attention; and when eager and fervent, and importunate in their discourses; it is attributed to Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>; but, notwithstanding all Wisdom's eagerness, zeal, warmth, and importunity, expressed by words and gestures, it was all disregarded; no attention was given to it, which is here complained of. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. The abruptness of the transition from gracious invitation to awful threatening has led to the suggestion that a pause is to be introduced between the two divisions (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/1-20.htm" title="Wisdom cries without; she utters her voice in the streets:...">Proverbs 1:20-33</a></span>) of this appeal of Wisdom. But, as Maurer points out, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm" title="How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?">Proverbs 1:22</a></span> (How long!) shews, as do these <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/1-24.htm" title="Because I have called, and you refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;...">Proverbs 1:24-25</a>, that this is rather the last appeal of Wisdom than the first. She has already “all day long stretched forth her hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-2.htm" title="I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, which walks in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;">Isaiah 65:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-21.htm" title="But to Israel he said, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.">Romans 10:21</a>). This is indicated by the LXX. by the tense used, <span class="greekheb">ἐκάλουν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξέτεινον</span>. The rejection of her overtures has been persistent and scornful; and now by the very abruptness and sternness of her address she makes a last effort to awaken and rescue.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Save, Lord, by love or fear.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/13-24.htm" title="Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able....">Luke 13:24-28</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because I have called, and ye refused.</span> A pause may be imagined, and  seems to be implied, between this and the preceding verses (22 and 23), when the address passes into a new phase - from that of invitation and promise to that of judgment and stern denunciation (vers. 24-27). In the subsection the antecedent clauses are vers. 24, 25, introduced by the conjunction "because" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">yaan</span>; <span class="accented">quia</span>, Vulgate), which expresses the reason or cause for the conclusion in vers. 26 and 27, introduced by "I also," to which the "because" answers. A similar grammatical construction and judgment is to be found in Isaiah: "I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I Spake, they did not hear" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-4.htm">Isaiah 66:4</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a>). <span class="accented">Refused</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> refused to hearken, as signified in the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">I have stretched out my hand.</span> A forensic gesture to arrest attention. The expression is equivalent to "I have spread out my hands" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>); cf. "Then Paul stretched forth the hand (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>)" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-1.htm">Acts 26:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Regarded</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">mak'shiv</span>). The original idea of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">kashav</span>), used here, is that of erecting or pricking up the ear, like the Latin <span class="accented">arrigere</span>, sc<span class="accented">. aures</span>, in Plaut., 'Rud.,' 5, 2, 6; and cf.

The expression is shaped after <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>, as if it were: They lay snares, as they themselves say, for the blood of others; but it is in reality for their own blood: they certainly lie in wait, as they say; but not, as they add, for the innocent, but for their own lives (Fl.).
