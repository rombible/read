But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? much less if he lose his soul?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The second form of temptation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a> note) appeals to the main attraction of the robber-life, its wild communism, the sense of equal hazards and equal hopes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15, 16.

To the evil of sin, to commit robberies and murder, and all manner of iniquity; they are eager upon it, and in haste and swift to do it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-18.htm">Proverbs 6:18</a> (x); being carried away with their inordinate affections, which are as feet to the soul; and drawn aside with their lusts, and pushed on by Satan, and, encouraged by one another, and so rush on headlong to the evil of punishment also; and which is a reason why their ways and paths should be abstained from, because they bring upon them swift destruction; it is to their own hurt they run, as Jarchi interprets it; though the first sense seems best to agree with what follows; <p>and make haste to shed blood; the blood of innocent persons, in order to get their substance, to cover their iniquity and shame, and that no information may be given of them; this is mentioned as having something very horrible in it, in order to deter from joining with them. <p>(x) "Velox ad facinus", Claudian. in Rufin. l. 1. v. 240. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. This verse is omitted here by the LXX.

At once the youth who listens will be hurried along impetuously to the two crimes of robbery and murder, which God has expressly forbidden in the eighth and sixth commandments respectively of the moral code. <span class="accented">Evil</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, <span class="accented">ra</span>) is "wickedness," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, generally, but here more specifically highway robbery, latrocinism (Cornelius a Lapide), as appears from vers. 11-13, where also murder, the laying in wait for blood, is proposed. The Rabbis Salomon and Salazar understand the evil to refer to the evil or destruction  which sinners bring upon themselves, and the shedding of blood to the fact that they lay themselves open to have their own blond shed by judicial process (see also Holden). The former explanation seems preferable to this, as putting a higher law than that of self-preservation before youth. The fear of judges who can condemn to death is notbing comparatively to the fear of him "who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell." This verse is wanting in the Vatican LXX., and Arabic, and hence Hitzig has concluded that it is an interpolation made from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>, but upon insufficient evidence, as it is found in the Alexandrian LXX., Chaldea Paraphrase, Vulgate, and Syriac Versions, all which follow the Hebrew text. The latter part of the verse is quoted by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-15.htm">Romans 3:15</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The general counsel of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a> is here followed by a more special warning:<p>My son, if sinners entice thee<p>Consent thou not.<p>The &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;<p>(Note: The accent Pazer over the &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; has the force of Athnach.)<p>(my son) is emphatically repeated. The intensive from &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; (signifies men to whom sin has become a habit, thus vicious, wicked. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (Pi. of &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;, to open) is not denom., to make or wish to make a &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;; the meaning, to entice (harmonizing with &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; obtains from the root-meaning of the Kal, for it is related to it as pandere (januam) to patere: to open, to make accessible, susceptible, namely to persuasion. The warning 10b is as brief as possible a call of alarm back from the abyss. In the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; (from &#1488;&#1489;&#1492;, to agree to, to be willing, see Wetstein in Job, p. 349) the preformative &#1488; is wanting, as in &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-14.htm">2 Samuel 19:14</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-20.htm">Psalm 139:20</a>, Ges. 68, 2, and instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492; ( equals  &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-8.htm">1 Kings 20:8</a>) is vocalized not &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>), but after the Aram. &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; (cf. &#1497;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;); see <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-29.htm">Genesis 26:29</a>, and Comment. on Isaiah, p. 648; Gesen. 75, 17. </body></html>
