That is, these proverbs were made, and written, and published, to make known or to teach men wisdom and knowledge; not only in things moral, and therefore these proverbs are by some called Solomon's "ethics"; and indeed they do contain the best system of morality in the whole world; nothing like it is to be extracted out of all the writings of the Heathen poets and philosophers: nor only in things civil; for which reason they may be called his "politics", seeing they are instructive to kings and civil magistrates, and to subjects; and also his "economics", seeing they furnish out rules for husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and servants, worthy of their attention and observance: but also they are a means of and are designed to teach spiritual and evangelical wisdom and knowledge; things relating to Jesus Christ, the wisdom of God, and the way of life and salvation by him, the knowledge of which is life eternal. These words, with others that follow, seem to be synonymous, and signify much one and the same thing; and are used to show that the most consummate wisdom and comprehensive knowledge may be attained by means of this book; which, like the rest of Scripture, with a divine blessing, is able to make a man "wise unto salvation"; and is "profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness", <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>; where the apostle seems to allude to this text: since "wisdom" here may stand for "doctrine" in general; and "instruction" may signify the means of attaining to it; and it may be observed, that the word is used for "discipline" and "correction", as well as "instruction". If these words are to be distinguished, the first, "wisdom", may design a wise scheme and plan of truths, and the theory of them and the latter, "instruction", the learning it and putting it into practice; and for both theory and practice this book is useful; <p>to perceive the words of understanding; which flow from a good understanding, and give a right understanding of things; so that a man may be able to distinguish between light and darkness, truth and error, right and wrong; particularly the doctrines of the Gospel may be meant, which are eminently so, and exceed the understanding of a natural man, and which are only understood by a spiritual man; the means of knowing which are the Scriptures, under the guidance and direction of the Spirit of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To know wisdom <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> and instruction; to perceive the words <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> of understanding;</span><p>(a) That is, what we ought to know and follow, and what we ought to refuse.<p>(b) Meaning, the word of God in which is the only true knowledge.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">To know</span>] The construction in this and the following clauses is elliptical: <span class="ital">The proverbs … to know, to discern, to receive, to give</span>; i.e. the proverbs of which the purpose is that men may know, discern, and receive (as it is expressed in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-5.htm" title="A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels:">Proverbs 1:5</a></span>), and that they (the proverbs) may give, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wisdom</span>] In this one word the whole subject of the Book is gathered up. But in these opening verses the scope and functions of this Wisdom, which the Book is designed to teach, are set forth by a variety of words employed to expand and describe it. It is <span class="ital">instruction</span>, or, rather, <span class="ital">discipline</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm" title="To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;">Proverbs 1:2</a></span>), not only instructive but corrective. It is <span class="ital">discriminating</span>, intelligent, penetrating, it <span class="ital">discerns</span> the words of understanding (<span class="ital">ib</span>. R.V.).

It sharpens the intellect, for it imparts <span class="ital">subtilty</span>, or <span class="bld">prudence</span> (R.V. marg. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-4.htm" title="To give subtlety to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.">Proverbs 1:4</a></span>). It adds <span class="ital">learning</span> (lit. <span class="ital">acquirement</span>) and the art of steering one’s course aright (<span class="ital">wise counsels</span>) by its growth and fuller application (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-5.htm" title="A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain to wise counsels:">Proverbs 1:5</a></span>).

"To know" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">ladaath</span>) is somewhat indefinite in the Authorized Version, and might be more accurately rendered. "from which men may know" (De Wette, Noyes); cf. <span class="accented">unde scias</span> (Munsterus). The <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> which is here prefixed to the infinitive, as in vers. 2, 8, and 6, gives the clause a final character, and thus points out the object which the teaching of the Proverbs has in view. The teaching is viewed from the standpoint of the learner, and hence what is indicated here is not the imparting of knowledge, but the reception or aprrspriation thereof on the part of the laemer. Schultens states that the radical meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">daath</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> the reception of knowledge into one's self. <span class="accented">Wisdom.</span> It will be necessary to go rather fully into this word here on its first appearance in the text. The Hebrew is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">khokhmah</span>). Wisdom is mentioned first, because it is the end to which all knowledge and instruction tend. The fundamental conception of the word is variously represented as either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the "power of judging," derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span>, "to be wise," from the Arabic, "to judge" (Oesenlus); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "the fixing of a thing for cognition," derived from the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, as before, which signifies "to fasten" (Zockler), or "compactness," from the same root as before, "to be firm, or closed." It is also variously defined <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as "<span class="accented">insight</span> into that upright dealing which pleases God - a <span class="accented">knowledge</span> of the right way which is to be followed before God, and of the wrong one which is to be shunned" (Zockler); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as "piety towards God," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a> (Gesenius); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as "the knowledge of things in their being and in the reality of their existence" (Delitzsch), The word is translated in the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, and in the Vulgate by <span class="accented">sapientia.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">khokhmah</span> and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> so far agree as philosophical terms in that the end of each is the same, viz. the striving after objective wisdom, the moral fitness of things; but the character of the former differs from that of the latter in being distinctly religious. The beginning and the end of the <span class="accented">khokhmah</span>, wisdom, is God (cf. ver. 7). Wisdom, then, is not the merely scientific knowledge, or moral philosophy, but knowledge <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> religious knowledge or piety towards God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an appreciation of what God requires of us and what we conversely owe to God. "Sapientia est de divinis" (Lyra). Wisdom will, of course, carry with it the notions of knowledge and insight. <span class="accented">Instruction.</span> As the preceding word represents wisdom in its intellectual conception, and has rather a theoretical character, so "instruction," Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">musar</span>), represents it on its practical side, and as such is its practical complement. The Hebrew <span class="accented">musar</span> signifies properly "chastisement," from the root <span class="accented">yasar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), "to correct," or "chastise," and hence education, moral training; and hence in the LXX. it is rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, which means both the process of education (cf. Plato, 'Repub.,' 376, E.; Arist., 'Pol.,' 8, 3) and its result as learning (Plato, 'Prob.,' 327, D.). The Vulgate has <span class="accented">disciplina.</span> In relation to wisdom, it is antecedent to it; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to know wisdom truly we must first become acquainted with instruction, and hence it is a preparatory step to the knowledge of wisdom, though here it is stated rather objectively. The words, "wisdom and instruction," are found in exactly the same collocation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-13.htm">Proverbs 4:13</a> and Proverbs 23:23. In its strictly disciplinary sense, "instruction" occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a>, with which comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>. Holden takes this word as "moral discipline" in the highest sense. <span class="cmt_word">To perceive the words of understanding;</span> literally, <span class="accented">to discern the words of discernment</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to comprehend the utterances which proceed from intelligence, and give expression to  it" (Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Understanding</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">vinah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), connected with the hiph. (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">l'havin</span>), properly "to distinguish," hence "to discern," of the same clause, signifies the capability of discerning the true from the false, good front bad, etc. With this agrees Cornelius a Lapide, who says, "Unde prudenter discernas inter bonum et malum, licitum et illicitum, utile et noxium, verum et falsum," and from which you are enabled to know what to do in any circumstances, and what not to do. The LXX. renders the word by <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the Vulgate by <span class="accented">prudentia.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in Plato and Aristotle, is the virtue concerned in the government of men, manage-merit of affairs, and the like (see Plato, 'Sym.,' 209, A.; Arist.,' Eth.,' N. 6, 5 and 8), and means practical wisdom, prudence, or moral wisdom. Van Ess, Allioli, Holden, translate "prudence." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/150.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Synagogue reckons up thirteen divine attributes according to ex.

It is, however, more probable that in the mind of the poet the tenfold halaluw encompassed by Hallelujah's is significative; for ten is the number of rounding off, completeness, exclusiveness, and of the extreme of exhaustibleness.

The third and fourth ha&#774;lalu give as the object of the praise that which is at the same time the ground of the praise: the tokens of His &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, i.e., of His all-subduing strength, and the plenitude of His greatness (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1493;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1493;), i.e., His absolute, infinite greatness. The fifth and sixth ha&#774;lalu bring into the concert in praise of God the ram's horn, &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;, the name of which came to be improperly used as the name also of the metallic &#1495;&#1510;&#1510;&#1512;&#1492; (vid., on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-4.htm">Psalm 81:4</a>), and the two kinds of stringed instruments (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-2.htm">Psalm 33:2</a>), viz., the nabla (i.e., the harp and lyre) and the kinnor (the cithern), the &#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; and the &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; (&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;). The seventh ha&#774;lalu invites to the festive dance, of which the chief instrumental accompaniment is the &#1514;&#1468;&#1507; (Arabic duff, Spanish adufe, derived from the Moorish) or tambourine. The eighth ha&#774;lalu brings on the stringed instruments in their widest compass, &#1502;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>) from &#1502;&#1503;, Syriac men&#305;&#770;n, and the shepherd's pipe, &#1506;&#1490;&#1489; (with the Gimel raphe  equals  &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;); and the ninth and tenth, the two kinds of castanets (&#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;, construct form of &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, singular &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;), viz., the smaller clear-sounding, and the larger deeper-toned, more noisy kinds (cf. &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>), as &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; (pausal form of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, like &#1505;&#1514;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>, and frequently, from &#1505;&#1514;&#1512;  equals  &#1505;&#1514;&#1512;) and &#1510;&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1497; &#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; are, with Schlultens, Pfeifer, Burk, Kster, and others, to be distinguished. </body></html>
