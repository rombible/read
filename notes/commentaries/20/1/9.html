We meet with the same expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-9.htm">Proverbs 4:9</a>, "She [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom] shall give to thine head an ornament of grace." The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">liv'yah</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">lavah</span>), "to wind a roll" (Delitzsch) or "to be joined closely with" (Gesenius), and hence signifies an ornament that is twisted, and so a wreath or garland. Gejerus and Schultens translate the phrase by <span class="accented">corolla gratiosa, i.e.</span> "a crown full of grace," and so meaning conferring or producing grace, just as the expression, "the chastisement of our peace" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>), means the chastisement bringing or procuring our peace. So again a "precious stone," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-8.htm">Proverbs 17:8</a>, margin, "a stone of grace," is one conferring gracefulness. The marginal reading, "an adding" (<span class="accented">additamentum</span>, Vatablus), conveys, though obscurely, the same idea; and this sense is again reproduced in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ut addatur gratia capiti suo</span> ("in order that grace may be added to thy head"). The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And chains about thy neck.</span> <span class="accented">Chains</span>; properly, <span class="accented">necklaces</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">anakim</span>), plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">anak</span>), "a cellar or necklace;" the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or "golden collar," of the LXX., and <span class="accented">torques</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> twisted neckchain) of the Vulgate. There is a very apposite parallel to this verse in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-20.htm">Proverbs 6:20, 21</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>). The gold chain round the neck was a mark of distinction, and was conferred on Joseph by Pharaoh when investing him with authority and dignity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>), and on Daniel by Belshazzar in the same way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a>). The mere adornment of the person with gold and pearls, without the further adornment of the moral character with Christian graces, is deprecated both by St. Paul and St. Peter (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9, 10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3, 4</a>). <span class="accented">Neck</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">gar'g'roth</span>) only occurs in the plural (Gesenius). (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-21.htm">Proverbs 6:21</a>.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the following, 2a is expanded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3-5</a>, then 2b in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-6.htm">Proverbs 1:6</a>.

But &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; is that which proceeds from chokma and musar when they are blended together: discipline of wisdom, discipline training to wisdom; i.e., such morality and good conduct as rest not on external inheritance, training, imitation, and custom, but is bound up with the intelligent knowledge of the Why and the Wherefore. &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-16.htm">Proverbs 21:16</a>, is inf. absol. used substantively (cf. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1496;, keeping quiet, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>) of &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; (whence &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500;, intellectus), to entwine, involve; for the thinking through a subject is represented as an interweaving, complicating, configuring of the thoughts (the syllogism is in like manner represented as &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, Aram. &#1505;&#1490;&#1493;&#1500;, a bunch of grapes), (with which also &#1505;&#1499;&#1500;, a fool, and &#1495;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;, to act foolishly, are connected, from the confusion of the thoughts, the entangling of the conceptions; cf. Arab. 'akl, to understand, and &#1502;&#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;). The series of synonyms (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-23.htm">Proverbs 23:23</a>) following in 3b, which are not well fitted to be the immediate object to &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;&#1514;, present themselves as the unfolding of the contents of the &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, as meaning that namely which is dutiful and right and honest. With the frequently occurring two conceptions &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;  (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>), (or with the order reversed as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-121.htm">Psalm 119:121</a>) is interchanged &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; (or with the order also reversed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-3.htm">Proverbs 21:3</a>). The remark of Heidenheim, that in &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; the conception of the justum, and in &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; that of the aequum prevails, is suggested by the circumstance that not &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; but &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; signifies &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2</a>) in the sense of liberality, and then of almsgiving (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;); but &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; also frequently signifies a way of thought and action which is regulated not by the letter of the law and by talio, but by love (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). Tsedek and ts'dakah have almost the relation to one another of integrity and justice which practically brings the former into exercise. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;, to make straight, to adjust, cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;, Arab. sabita, to be smooth) is the right and the righteousness in which it realizes itself, here subjectively considered, the right mind.<p>(Note: According to Malbim, &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; is the fixed objective right, &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; the righteousness which does not at once decide according to the letter of the law, but always according to the matter and the person.)<p>&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (defect. for &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, to be straight, even) is plur. tantum; for its sing. &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (after the form &#1502;&#1497;&#1496;&#1489;) the form &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512; (in the same ethical sense, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-6.htm">Malachi 2:6</a>) is used: it means thus a way of thought and of conduct that is straight, i.e., according to what is right, true, i.e., without concealment, honest, i.e., true to duty and faithful to one's word.</body></html>
