But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days.

When our Lord was upon earth such robbing with violence and bloodshed was so familiar an incident in Palestine that He was able to make it the groundwork of a parable (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-30.htm" title="And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.">Luke 10:30</a>). And it is so still. “Strange country! and it has always been so. There are a hundred allusions to just such things in the history, the psalms and the prophets of Israel.

Vol. i. ch. iii.), the warning was no less apposite in England. In our own day, even in the special form which it here assumes, the warning, in view of the gangs of desperate men, poachers and burglars, to be found still both in towns and in the country, has not come to be superfluous, while in its wider aspect, “My son, if sinners entice thee consent thou not,” it is of universal application.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My son, if sinners entice thee.</span> (As to the form of address, see ver. 8.) It is here used because the writer is passing to a warning against bad company, and hence the term is emphatic, and intended to call especial attention to what is said. It is repeated again in ver. 15, at a further stage in this address, with the same view. <span class="accented">Sinners</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">khattaim</span>), the plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">khatta</span>), from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">khata</span>), properly "to miss the mark, to err;" cf. Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, "to sin" (Gesenius), here equivalent to "habitual, abandoned sinners," and those especially who make robbery and bloodshed a profession. Not simply <span class="accented">peccantes, i.e.</span> sinners as a generic designation of the human race, for "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>), but <span class="accented">peccatores</span> (Chaldee, Syriac, Pagin., Tigur., Versions and Vulgate). "sinners," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those who sin habitually, knowingly, wilfully, and maliciously  (Gejerus), or those who give themselves up to iniquity, and persuade others to follow their example (Cartwright). In the New Testament they are styled <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>. They are those of whom David speaks in strikingly parallel language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-9.htm">Psalm 26:9</a>, "Gather not my soul with sinners (<span class="accented">khattaim</span>), nor my life with bloody men" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>).

The noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">p'thi</span>), is "one easily enticed or persuaded" (Gesenius).

The idea is expressed in the Vulgate by <span class="accented">lactaverint</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "if sinners allure or deceive thee with fair words." The Syriac, Montan., Jun. et Tremell., Versions read <span class="accented">pellexerint</span>, from <span class="accented">pellicio</span>, "to entice." <span class="cmt_word">Consent thou not.</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">al-tove</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>).
