But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths. Men's greediness of gain hurries them upon practices which will not suffer them or others to live out half their days. What is a man profited, though he gain the world, if he lose his life? much less if he lose his soul?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The second form of temptation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a> note) appeals to the main attraction of the robber-life, its wild communism, the sense of equal hazards and equal hopes. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-14.

Among one or another we meet with; gold and silver and precious stones, everything that is valuable; not considering that hereby they were in danger of losing the more precious substance, their immortal souls; and the most precious substance of all, the enjoyment of God, and happiness with him to all eternity, which is the "more enduring substance": the things of this world, properly speaking, are not substance, though wicked men so judge them; they are things that are not; nor are they "precious", in comparison of spiritual and heavenly things; but they are what carnal men set a high price and value upon, and risk the loss of their name, lives, and souls for; <p>we shall fill our houses with spoil; Aben Ezra interprets this of garments; but it may not only design the garments taken from the persons robbed and killed; but also their money, commodities, and goods they were travelling with, which in time would be so large as to fill everyone of their houses; covetousness lies at the bottom of all this wickedness; the love of money is the root of all evil. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We shall find all precious substance.</span> This verse carries on the proposal of the sinners one step further, and puts forward a third enticement, viz. that of' the profit of crime, or the prospect of immediate riches, before youth to join in crime. A short cut to wealth, and to the acquirement of that which costs others long years of steady application and carefulness, is a strong inducement (Wardlaw). <span class="accented">We shall find</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">nim'tza</span>), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">matza</span>), properly "to reach to," and "to find," in the sense of "to come upon;" cf. Latin <span class="accented">invenio. Substance</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">hon</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> substance in the sense of riches. The radical meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hun</span>), from which it is derived, is the same as in the Arabic word, "to be light, easy, to be in easy circumstances, and so to be rich" (Gesenius). In its abstract sense, <span class="accented">hon</span>, "substance," means ease, comfort, and concretely riches which bring about that result (see also Fleischer, as quoted by Delitzsch); cf. the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> collectively, possessions, property. The Piscatoris Version, for "precious substance," reads <span class="accented">divitias</span>, "riches." <span class="accented">Precious</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">yakar</span>), properly " heavy," is found with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hon</span>), "substance," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27</a> and Proverbs 24:4. The collocation of the ideas of lightness and heavineess in these two words is striking, but we need not necessarily suppose that any oxymoron is intended, as Schnltens. Such combinations occur in other languages, and reside more in the radical meanings of the words than in the mind or intention of the writer or speaker. <span class="cmt_word">We shall fill our houses with spoil</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they promise not only finding, but full possession (Gejerus, Muffet). <span class="accented">Spoil</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">shalal</span>), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">shalal</span>), same as the Arabic verb "to draw," and hence "to strip off' (Gesenius); and equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span> (LXX.), the arms stripped off a slain enemy, spoils, and the Latin <span class="accented">spolia</span> (Vulgate). <span class="accented">Shalal</span> is used generally, as here, for "prey," "booty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-27.htm">Genesis 49:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-9.htm">Exodus 15:9</a>). Our gains, say  the robbers, will not only be valuable, but numerous and plentiful. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The title of the book is followed by its motto, symbol, device:<p>The fear of Jahve is the beginning of knowledge;<p>Wisdom and discipline is despised by fools.<p>The first hemistich expresses the highest principle of the Israelitish Chokma, as it is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-33.htm">Proverbs 15:33</a>), <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a> (whence the lxx has interpolated here two lines). &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; combines in itself, as &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;, the ideas of initium (accordingly J. H. Michaelis: initium cognitionis, a quo quisquis recte philosophari cupit auspicium facere debet) and principium, i.e., the basis, thus the root (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-28.htm">Job 19:28</a>).<p>(Note: In Sirach 1:14, 16, the Syr. has both times &#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1514;&#1488;; but in the second instance, where the Greek translation has &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>) may have existed in the original text.)<p>Wisdom comes from God, and whoever fears Him receives it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>.). &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is reverential subordination to the All-directing, and since designedly &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is used, and not &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (&#1492;), to the One God, the Creator and Governor of the world, who gave His law unto Israel, and also beyond Israel left not His holy will unattested; the reverse side of the fear of Jahve as the Most Holy One is &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-13.htm">Proverbs 8:13</a> (post-biblical &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;). The inverted placing of the words 7b imports that the wisdom and discipline which one obtains in the way of the fear of God is only despised by the &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., the hard, thick, stupid; see regarding the root-word &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, coalescere, cohaerere, incrassari, der Prophet Jesaia, p. 424, and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-4.htm">Psalm 73:4</a>. Schultens rightly compares &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, crassi pro stupidis.<p>(Note: Malbim's explanation is singular: the sceptics, from &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, perhaps! This also is Heidenheim's view.)<p>&#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; has the tone on the penult., and thus comes from &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;; the 3rd pr. of &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492; would be &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;. The perf. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-29.htm">Proverbs 1:29</a>) is to be interpreted after the Lat. oderunt (Ges. 126). </body></html>
