Christ himself is Wisdom, is Wisdoms. Three sorts of persons are here called by Him: 1. Simple ones. Sinners are fond of their simple notions of good and evil, their simple prejudices against the ways of God, and flatter themselves in their wickedness. 2. Scorners. Proud, jovial people, that make a jest of every thing. Scoffers at religion, that run down every thing sacred and serious. 3. Fools. Those are the worst of fools that hate to be taught, and have a rooted dislike to serious godliness. The precept is plain; Turn you at my reproof. We do not make a right use of reproofs, if we do not turn from evil to that which is good. The promises are very encouraging. Men cannot turn by any power of their own; but God answers, Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you. Special grace is needful to sincere conversion. But that grace shall never be denied to any who seek it. The love of Christ, and the promises mingled with his reproofs, surely should have the attention of every one. It may well be asked, how long men mean to proceed in such a perilous path, when the uncertainty of life and the consequences of dying without Christ are considered? Now sinners live at ease, and set sorrow at defiance; but their calamity will come. Now God is ready to hear their prayers; but then they shall cry in vain. Are we yet despisers of wisdom? Let us hearken diligently, and obey the Lord Jesus, that we may enjoy peace of conscience and confidence in God; be free from evil, in life, in death, and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Desolation - Better, tempest.

The rendering <span class="ital">early</span> is due to the doubtful connection (see Bp Perowne on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-1.htm" title="O God, you are my God; early will I seek you: my soul thirsts for you, my flesh longs for you in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;">Psalm 63:1</a>) of the Heb. word with <span class="ital">the dawn</span> (<span class="ital">mane consurgent</span>, Vulg.). Here in fact, so far from being early, it is not only late, but too late. It may of course be urged in favour of retaining the received rendering (as R.V. marg.) that the seeking is early as regards the coming of the calamity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-15.htm" title="I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.">Hosea 5:15</a>); but the other sense includes this.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - The phase which the address now enters upon continues to the thirty-first verse. The change in this verse from the second to the third person is striking. It  implies that Wisdom thinks fools no longer worthy of being addressed personally - "Quasi stultos indignos censunt ulteriori alloquio" (Gejerus and Michaelis). The declaration is the embodiment of the laughter and scorn of ver. 26. The three verbs, "they shall call," "they shall seek," "they shall find," occur in uncommon and emphatic forms in the original. They are some out of the few instances where the future terminations are inserted fully before the pronominal suffix. <span class="cmt_word">I will not answer</span>. The distress and anguish consequent upon their calamity and fear lead them to pray, but there will be no answer nor heed given to their cry. They are not heard, because they do not cry rightly nor in the time of grace (Lapide). See the striking parallel to the tenor of this passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24-28</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They shall seek me early;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> diligently. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shakhar</span>) is the denominative from the substantive <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shakar</span>), "the dawn, morning," and signifies to go out and seek something in the obscurity of the morning twilight (Delitzsch, Zockler), and hence indicates diligence and earnestness in the search. Gesenius gives the same derivation, but connects it with the dawn in the sense of the light breaking forth, and thus, as it were, seeking (see also Proverbs 2:27; 7:15; 8:17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet has now reached that part of his introduction where he makes use of the very words uttered by Wisdom:<p>How long, ye simple, will ye love simplicity,<p>And scorners delight in scorning,<p>And fools hate knowledge?<p>Three classes of men are here addressed: the &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, the simple, who, being accessible to seduction, are only too susceptible of evil; the &#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, mockers, i.e., free-thinkers (from &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, Arab. lus&#803;, flectere, torquere, properly qui verbis obliquis utitur); and the &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, fools, i.e., the mentally imbecile and stupid (from &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;, Arab. kasal, to be thick, coarse, indolent). The address to these passes immediately over into a declaration regarding them; cf. the same enallage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>. &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497; has the accent Mahpach, on account of the Pasek following; vid., Torath Emeth, p. 26. Intentionally, Wisdom addresses only the &#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, to whom she expects to find soonest access. Between the futt., which express the continuing love and hatred, stands the perf. &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, which expresses that in which the mockers found pleasure, that which was the object of their love. &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; is the so-called dat. ethicus, which reflexively refers to that which is said to be the will and pleasure of the subject; as we say, "I am fond of this and that." The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, Abulwald, Parchon, and Kimchi regard as Piel; but &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; instead of &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; would be a recompensatio of the virtual doubling, defacing the character of the Piel. Schultens regards it as a defectively written Pail (in Syr.), but it is not proved that this conjugation exists in Hebr.; much rather &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is the only possible Kal form with &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; without the pause, regularly formed from &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; (vid., Ewald, 193, a). The division by the accent Mercha-Mahpach of the two words &#1514;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493; &#1508;&#1514;&#1497; is equal in value to the connecting of them by Makkeph; vid., Baer's Psalterium, p. x. In codd., and also in correct texts, &#1514;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493; is written with the accent Galgal on the first syllable, as the servant of the Mercha-Mahpach. The Gaja is incorrectly here and there placed under the &#1514;&#1468;. </body></html>
