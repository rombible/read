But they have so much the more to answer for. How cautious young people should be! Consent thou not. Do not say as they say, nor do as they do, or would have thee to do; have no fellowship with them. Who could think that it should be a pleasure to one man to destroy another! See their idea of worldly wealth; but it is neither substance, nor precious. It is the ruinous mistake of thousands, that they overvalue the wealth of this world. Men promise themselves in vain that sin will turn to their advantage. The way of sin is down-hill; men cannot stop themselves. Would young people shun temporal and eternal ruin, let them refuse to take one step in these destructive paths.

These sins of robbery and murder are particularly instanced in, not only because other sins lead unto them, as sabbath breaking, drunkenness, and lewdness, and issue in temporal and eternal ruin; but because they were very common among the Jews at the time that Wisdom, or Christ, was here on earth: to which time the whole passage refers, as appears from the following verses; and that those sins were frequent then is manifest both from Scripture; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-38.htm">Matthew 27:38</a>; and from the confessions of the Jews, who say (z) that forty years before the destruction of the temple the sanhedrim were obliged to remove from place to place, because that murderers increased, and they could not judge and condemn them, for fear of being murdered themselves; and it was because of this great increase they were obliged to stop the beheading of the red heifer (a). <p>(z) T.

The idea of greed and covetousness enters largely into the word. Which <span class="cmt_word">taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</span> The pronoun "which" does not occur in the original. The nominative to "taketh away" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">yikkath</span>) is "gain;" the "unjust gain." (<span class="accented">betsa</span>) takes away the life of its owners, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of those who are under its power. <span class="accented">Owners thereof</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, <span class="accented">b'alayo</span>) does not necessarily imply that they are in actual possession of the unjust gain, but rather refers to the influence which the lust for gain exercises over them. The expression in this second hemistich does not mean that the rapacious take the life of their comrades who possess the gain, as Rabbi Salomon; nor as the Vulgate, "the ways of the avaricious man take away the lives of those who possess them." For the phrase, "taketh away the life," as importing a violent taking away, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>. The sentiment of the verse is well expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, "For the love of money is the root of all evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Note: Here, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-14.htm">Proverbs 1:14</a>, &#1490;&#1493;&#1512;&#1500;&#1498; is to be written with Munach (not Metheg) in the second syllable; vid., Torath Emeth, p. 20. Accentuationssystem, vii. 2.)<p>To their invitation, bearing in itself its own condemnation, they add as a lure the splendid self-enriching treasures which in equal and just fellowship with them they may have the prospect of sharing. &#1492;&#1493;&#1503; (from &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, levem, then facilem esse, tre ais,  son aise) means aisance, convenience, opulence, and concretely that by which life is made agreeable, thus money and possessions (Fleischer in Levy's Chald. Wrterbuch, i. 423f.). With this &#1492;&#1493;&#1503; with remarkable frequency in the Mishle &#1497;&#1511;&#1512; (from &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;, Arab. wak&#803;ar, grave esse) is connected in direct contrast, according to its primary signification; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-4.htm">Proverbs 24:4</a> : heavy treasures which make life light. Yet it must not be maintained that, as Schultens has remarked, this oxymoron is intended, nor also that it is only consciously present in the language. &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; has here its primitive appropriate signification of attaining, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-14.htm">Isaiah 10:14</a> of reaching. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500; (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1500;, to draw from, draw out, from &#1513;&#1500;, cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1507;, Arab. salab, Comm. on Isa. p. 447) is that which is drawn away from the enemy, exuviae, and then the booty and spoil taken in war generally. &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, to fill with anything, make full, governs a double accusative, as the Kal (to become full of anything) governs only one. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-14.htm">Proverbs 1:14</a>, the invitation shows how the prospect is to be realized. Interpreters have difficulty in conceiving what is here meant. Do not a share by lot and a common purse exclude one another? Will they truly, in the distribution of the booty by lot, have equal portions at length, equally much in their money-bags? Or is it meant that, apart from the portion of the booty which falls to every one by lot, they have a common purse which, when their business is ebbing, must supply the wants of the company, and on which the new companion can maintain himself beforehand? Or does it mean only that they will be as mutually helpful to one another, according to the principle &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769; (amicorum omnia communia), as if they had only one purse? The meaning is perfectly simple. The oneness of the purse consists in this, that the booty which each of them gets, belongs not wholly or chiefly to him, but to the whole together, and is disposed of by lot; so that, as far as possible, he who participated not at all in the affair in obtaining it, may yet draw the greatest prize. This view harmonizes the relation between 14b and 14a. The common Semitic &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is even used at the present day in Syria and elsewhere as the name of the Exchange ("Brse") (plur. akja&#770;s); here it is the purse ("Kasse") (&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Procop.), which is made up of the profits of the business. This profit consists not merely in gold, but is here thought of in regard to its worth in gold. The apparent contradiction between distributing by lot and having a common purse disappears when the distribution by lot of the common property is so made, that the retaining of a stock-capital, or reserve fund, is not excluded. </body></html>
