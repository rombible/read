Men of mean abilities, weak capacities, shallow understandings, incautious, credulous, and easily imposed upon: these, by attending to what is herein contained, may arrive to a serpentine subtlety; though they are simple and harmless as doves, may become as wise as serpents; may attain to an exquisite knowledge of divine things and know even more than the wise and sage philosophers among the Gentiles, or any of the Rabbins and masters of Israel; or any of the princes of this world, whose wisdom comes to nought; and become very cautious and circumspect how they are drawn aside by the old serpent the devil, or by such who lie in wait to deceive; and perform their duty both to God and man; <p>to the young man knowledge and discretion; or "thought" (i); who wants both: this book will teach him the knowledge of things moral, civil, and religious: to think and act aright; how to behave and conduct himself wisely and discreetly before men; and be a means of forming his mind betimes for piety and religion; and of furnishing him with rules for his deportment in future life, in all the periods of it; and in whatsoever state and condition he may come into.

The Hebrew word for <span class="ital">simple</span> is literally <span class="ital">open</span> (Heb.), sc. to influence, whether good or bad. The primary meaning of the English word <span class="ital">simple</span>, whether it be <span class="ital">without fold</span> (Trench) or <span class="ital">one-fold</span> (Skeat) is entirely different; but the idea conveyed by it adequately represents the meaning of the Hebrew. For, as Trench points out, to be without fold (or to be one-fold) is to be “just what we may imagine Nathanael to have been, and what our Lord attributes as the highest honour to him, the ‘Israelite without guile.’ ” But then since, as he truly adds, “in a world like ours such a man will make himself a prey, will prove no match for the fraud and falsehood he will everywhere encounter,” he needs the safeguard of <span class="ital">subtilty</span>, or <span class="ital">prudence</span> (R.V. marg.) to preserve him (see <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm" title="How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?">Proverbs 1:22</a></span>, below). Such subtilty may be the <span class="ital">craft</span> of the serpent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-1.htm" title="Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, Yes, has God said, You shall not eat of every tree of the garden?">Genesis 3:1</a>, where the Heb. word is the same); but it may be the <span class="ital">wisdom</span> of the serpent without its guile (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16</a>, and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-5.htm" title="O you simple, understand wisdom: and, you fools, be you of an understanding heart.">Proverbs 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-5.htm" title="A fool despises his father's instruction: but he that regards reproof is prudent.">Proverbs 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-25.htm" title="Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that has understanding, and he will understand knowledge.">Proverbs 19:25</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">simple</span>, though specially to be found among the <span class="ital">young</span> of the parallel clause of the verse, embrace others also.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To give subtilty to the simple.</span> In this verse and the following we are introduced to the classes of persons to whom the proverbs will be beneficial The <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> with the infinitive, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">latheth</span>) shows that in construction this proposition is so ordinate with those in vers. 2 and 3, and not dependent as represented by <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1ff7;</span> (LXX.)and iut <span class="accented">detur</span> (Vulgate). <span class="accented">Subtilty</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">ar'mah</span>),  from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, (<span class="accented">aram</span>), "to be crafty or wily," properly means "nakedness" or "smoothness;" hence in a metaphorical sense it expresses "the capacity for escaping from the wiles of others" (Umbreit). We have this idea expressed as follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>, "The prudent man (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">arum</span>) foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself." In the Arabic Version it is rendered by <span class="accented">calliditas</span>, "shrewdness," in a good sense. The Hebrew <span class="accented">ar'mah</span>, like the Latin <span class="accented">calliditas</span>, also means "craftiness," as appears in the use of the cognate adjective <span class="accented">arum</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, where we read, "The serpent was more subtle," etc. For "subtilty" the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, a Greek word which appears to be employed altogether in a bad sense, as "trickery," "villainy," "knavery;" but that scarcely appears to be the meaning of the Hebrew here, since the aim of the Proverbs is ethical and beneficial in the highest degree. The Vulgate <span class="accented">astutia</span>, the quality of the <span class="accented">astutus</span>, beside the bad sense of craftiness, also boars the good sense of <span class="accented">shrewdness</span>, sagacity, and so better represents the Hebrew. "Subtilty may turn to evil, but it also takes its place among the highest moral gifts" (Plumptre). <span class="accented">The simple</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">ph'thaim</span>), plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">p'ti</span>) from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">pathakh</span>), "to be open," properly means the open-hearted, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those who are susceptible to external impressions (Zockler), and so easily misled. The word occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-7.htm">Proverbs 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-5.htm">Proverbs 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-18.htm">Proverbs 14:18</a>; and Proverbs 27:12. The LXX. properly renders the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "unknowing of evil." The same idea is indirectly expressed in the Vulgate <span class="accented">parvuli</span>, "the very young;" and the term is paraphrased in the Arabic Version, <span class="accented">iis in quibus non est malitia</span> ("those who are without malice"). The Hebrew here means "simple" in the sense of inexperienced. <span class="cmt_word">To the young man knowledge and discretion.</span> The Hebrew <span class="accented">naar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>) is here used representatively for "youth" (cf. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">adolescens</span>) in general, which stands in need of the qualities here mentioned.

The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which clasically means perception by the senses and also by the mind. <span class="accented">Discretion</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">m'zimmah</span>), properly "thoughtfulness," and hence "circumspection" or "caution" (Zockler), or "discernment," that which sets a man on his guard and prevents him being duped by others (Plumptre). <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> was probably adopted by the LXX. in its primary sense as representing the act of thinking; <span class="accented">intellectus</span> (Vulgate), equivalent to "a discerning" (see the marginal "<span class="accented">advisement"</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/psalms/150.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Synagogue reckons up thirteen divine attributes according to ex.

It is, however, more probable that in the mind of the poet the tenfold halaluw encompassed by Hallelujah's is significative; for ten is the number of rounding off, completeness, exclusiveness, and of the extreme of exhaustibleness. The local definitions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/150-1.htm">Psalm 150:1</a> are related attributively to God, and designate that which is heavenly, belonging to the other world, as an object of praise. &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1493;&#1468; (the possible local meaning of which is proved by the &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; of the Tabernacle and of the Temple) is in this passage the heavenly &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;; and &#1512;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1493; is the firmament spread out by God's omnipotence and testifying of God's omnipotence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-35.htm">Psalm 68:35</a>), not according to its front side, which is turned towards the earth, but according to the reverse or inner side, which is turned towards the celestial world, and which marks it off from the earthly world. The third and fourth ha&#774;lalu give as the object of the praise that which is at the same time the ground of the praise: the tokens of His &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, i.e., of His all-subduing strength, and the plenitude of His greatness (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1493;  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1493;), i.e., His absolute, infinite greatness.
