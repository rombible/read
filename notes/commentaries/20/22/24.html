Do not associate with him; contract not a familiarity with him; make him not a companion; take him not into an intimacy, or use him as a particular friend and acquaintance: a man should be courteous, and carry it civilly to all men; but he should take care whom he admits as his bosom friend; he should be cautious in his choice of a familiar friend, and not receive any; and, among the rest, avoid an angry and passionate man, one who is much given to passion himself, and stirs it up in others; for there can be no lasting peace and pleasure in such a man's company and conversation; <p>and with a furious man thou shall not go: not take a walk with him, much less a journey; or shall not be frequently together.

The perfects &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; and &#1499;&#1514;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; refer, not to the Solomonic proverbial discourses, but to the appendix following them; the preface commends the worth and intention of this appendix, and uses perfects because it was written after the forming of the collection. The author of this preface (vid., pp. 23, 36, vol. i.) is no other than the author of chap. 1-9. The &#1492;&#1496; (with Mehuppach, after Thorath Emeth, p. 27) reminds us of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-1.htm">Proverbs 5:1</a>. The phrase &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;, animum advertere, occurs again in the second appendix, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-32.htm">Proverbs 24:32</a>. &#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; is repeated at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-8.htm">Proverbs 23:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-4.htm">Proverbs 24:4</a>; but &#1504;&#1506;&#1501; with &#1504;&#1506;&#1501; is common in the preface, chap. 1-9. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; contains, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-3.htm">Psalm 135:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/147-1.htm">Psalm 147:1</a>, its subject in itself. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1501; is not this subject: this that thou preservest them, which would have required rather the infin. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>) or &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1501;; but it supposes the case in which appears that which is amiable and praiseworthy: if thou preservest them in thy heart, i.e., makest them thoughtfully become thy mental possession. The suffix e&#772;m refers to the Words of the Wise, and mediately also to &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, for the author designates his practical wisdom &#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;, which is laid down in the following proverbs, which, although not composed by him, are yet penetrated by his subjectivity. Regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;, which, from meaning the inner parts of the body, is transferred to the inner parts of the mind, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-27.htm">Proverbs 20:27</a>. The clause 18b, if not dependent on &#1499;&#1497;, would begin with &#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;. The absence of the copula and the antecedence of the verb bring the optative rendering nearer. Different is the syntactical relation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2</a>, where the infin. is continued in the fin. The fut. Niph. &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>, meant to be rightly placed, rightly directed, here means: to stand erect, to have continuance, stabilem esse. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-19.htm">Proverbs 22:19</a>, the fact of instruction precedes the statement of its object, which is, that the disciple may place his confidence in Jahve, for he does that which is according to His will, and is subject to His rule. &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495;&#1498;, in Codd. and correct editions with Pathach (vid., Michlol 184b); the &#1495; is as virtually doubled; vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-22.htm">Proverbs 21:22</a>. In 19b the accentuation &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; is contrary to the syntax; Codd. and old editions have rightly &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;, for &#1488;&#1507;&#1470;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is, after Gesen. 121. 3, an emphatic repetition of "thee;" &#1488;&#1507;, like &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-15.htm">Proverbs 23:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>. Hitzig knows of no contrast which justifies the emphasis. But the prominence thus effected is not always of the nature of contrast (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm">Zechariah 7:5</a>, have ye truly fasted to me, i.e., to serve me thereby), here it is strong individualizing; the te etiam te is equivalent to, thee as others, and thee in particular. Also that, as Hitzig remarks, there does not appear any reason for the emphasizing of "to-day," is incorrect: &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; is of the same signification as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>; the reader of the following proverbs shall remember later, not merely in general, that he once on a time read them, but that he to-day, that he on this definite day, received the lessons of wisdom contained therein, and then, from that time forth, became responsible for his obedience or his disobedience.<p>In 20a the Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1513;&#1500;&#1513;&#1493;&#1501; denotes no definite date; besides, this word occurs only always along with &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500; (&#1506;&#1514;&#1502;&#1493;&#1500;). Umbreit, Ewald, Bertheau, however, accept this "formerly (lately)," and suppose that the author here refers to a "Book for Youths," composed at an earlier period, without one seeing what this reference, which had a meaning only for his contemporaries, here denotes. The lxx reads &#1499;&#1514;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;, and finds in 20a, contrary to the syntax and the usus loq., the exhortation that he who is addressed ought to write these good doctrines thrice (&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;) on the tablet of his heart; the Syr. and Targ. suppose the author to say that he wrote them three times; Jerome, that he wrote them threefold - both without any visible meaning, since threefold cannot be equivalent to manchfeltiglich (Luther) [ equals  several times, in various ways]. Also the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, which without doubt is the authentic word, is interpreted in many unacceptable ways; Rashi and Elia Wilna, following a Midrash explanation, think on the lessons of the Law, the Prophets, and the Hagiographa; Arama, on those which are referable to three classes of youth; Malbim (as if here the author of the whole Book of Proverbs, from 1 to 31, spake), on the supposed three chief parts of the Mishle; Dchsel better, on chap. 1-9, as the product of the same author as this appendix. Schultens compares <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>, and translates triplici filo nexa. Kimchi, Meri, and others, are right, who gloss &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; by &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1499;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, and compare &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-6.htm">Proverbs 8:6</a>; accordingly the Veneta, with the happy quid pro quo, by &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;. The lxx translates the military &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; by &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;; but this Greek word is itself obscure, and is explained by Hesychius (as well as by Suidas, and in the Etymologicum) by Regii satellites qui ternas hastas manu tenebant, which is certainly false. Another Greek, whom Angellius quotes, says, under <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>, that &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; was the name given to the warriors who fought from a chariot, every three of whom had one war-chariot among them; and this appears, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>, to be really the primary meaning. In the period of David we meet with the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; as the name of the heroes (the Gibbo&#770;r&#305;&#770;m) who stood nearest the king. The shalish-men form the lite troops that stood highest in rank, at whose head stood two triads of heroes - Jashobeam at the head of the first trias, and thus of the shalish-men generally; Abishai at the head of the second trias, who held an honourable place among the shalish-men, but yet reached not to that first trias, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>. ( equals  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>.). The name &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/2.htm">Revelation 2</a> Samuel <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/23-8.htm">Revelation 23:8</a>, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-6.htm">1 Chronicles 27:6</a>, incorrectly &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;) occurs here with reference to the threefold division of this principal host; and in regard to the use of the word in the time of Pharaoh, as well as in the time of the kings, it may be granted that shalish denotes the Three-man (triumvir), and then generally a high military officer; so that &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; here has the same relation to &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-6.htm">Proverbs 8:6</a>, as ducalia to principalia. The name of the chief men (members of the chief troop) is transferred to the chief proverbs, as, <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-8.htm">James 2:8</a>, that law which stands as a king at the head of all the others is called the "royal law;" or, as Plato names the chief powers of the soul, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;. As in this Platonic word-form, so shalishim here, like negidim there, is understood neut. cf. under <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-6.htm">Proverbs 8:6</a>, and &#1512;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-11.htm">Proverbs 12:11</a>; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-13.htm">Proverbs 16:13</a>. The &#1489; of &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; (occurring at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a> also) Fleischer rightly explains as the &#1489; of uniting or accompanying: chief proverbs which contain good counsels and solid knowledge.<p>In the statement of the object in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-21.htm">Proverbs 22:21</a>, we interpret that which follows &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;&#1498; not permutat.: ut te docerem recta, verba vera (Fleischer); but &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496; (ground-form to &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-6.htm">Psalm 60:6</a>) is the bearer of the threefold idea: rectitudinem, or, better, regulam verborum veritatis. The (Arab.) verb k&#803;asit&#803;a means to be straight, stiff, inflexible (synon. &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, to be hard, tight, proportionately direct); and the name k&#803;ist&#803; denotes not only the right conduct, the right measure (quantitas justa), but also the balance, and thus the rule or the norm. In 21b, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; (as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a>; vid., Philippi, Status Constr. p. 86f.) is equivalent to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;; the author has this second time intentionally chosen the appositional relation of connection: words which are truth; the idea of truth presents itself in this form of expression more prominently. Impossible, because contrary to the usus loq., is the translation: ut respondeas verba vera iis qui ad te mittunt (Schultens, Fleischer), because &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, with the accus. following, never means "to send any one." Without doubt &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; stand in correlation to each other: he who lets himself be instructed must be supposed to be in circumstances to bring home, to those that sent him out to learn, doctrines which are truth, and thus to approve himself. The subject spoken of here is not a right answer or a true report brought back to one giving a commission; and it lies beyond the purpose and power of the following proverbs to afford a universal means whereby persons sent out are made skilful. The &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; [senders] are here the parents or guardians who send him who is to be instructed to the school of the teacher of wisdom (Hitzig). Yet it appears strange that he who is the learner is just here not addressed as "my son," which would go to the support of the expression, "to send to school," which is elsewhere unused in Old Hebrew, and the &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497; of another are elsewhere called those who make him their mandatar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-26.htm">Proverbs 10:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-13.htm">Proverbs 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-13.htm">2 Samuel 24:13</a>. The reference to the parents would also be excluded if, with Norzi and other editors, &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1498; were to be read instead of &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1498; (the Venet. 1521, and most editions). Therefore the phrase &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, which is preferred by Ewald, recommends itself, according to which the lxx translates, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, which the Syro-Hexap. renders<p>continued...</body></html>
