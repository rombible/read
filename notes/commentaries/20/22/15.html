Divine Providence has so ordered it, that some are rich, and others poor, but all are guilty before God; and at the throne of God's grace the poor are as welcome as the rich. 3. Faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners, and looks to Jesus Christ as the sure refuge from the storm. 4. Where the fear of God is, there will be humility. And much is to be enjoyed by it; spiritual riches, and eternal life at last. 5. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous. But the way of duty is safe and easy. 6. Train children, not in the way they would go, that of their corrupt hearts, but in the way they should go; in which, if you love them, you would have them go. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour. 7. This shows how important it is for every man to keep out of debt. As to the things of this life, there is a difference between the rich and the poor; but let the poor remember, it is the Lord that made the difference. 8. The power which many abuse, will soon fail them. 9. He that seeks to relieve the wants and miseries of others shall be blessed. 10. Profane scoffers and revilers disturb the peace. 11. God will be the Friend of a man in whose spirit there is no guile; this honour have all the saints. 12. God turns the counsels and designs of treacherous men to their own confusion. 13. The slothful man talks of a lion without, but considers not his real danger from the devil, that roaring lion within, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him. 14. The vile sin of licentiousness commonly besots the mind beyond recovery. 15. Sin is foolishness, it is in the heart, there is an inward inclination to sin: children bring it into the world with them; and it cleaves close to the soul. We all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father. 16. We are but stewards, and must distribute what God intrusts to our care, according to his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fall of the man into the snare of the harlot seems to be the consequence of the abhorrence or wrath of Yahweh.

That is, sin, the greatest of all folly; this is naturally in the heart of man; it is in the heart of a child, it is in him from his infancy; it is bound in his heart, it is rooted and riveted in him, being conceived in sin, and shapen in iniquity; it is what cleaves close to him, and he has a strong affection for and desire after: the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>; so that he is not easily brought off of sin, or becomes wise; <p>but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him; the rod used by parents, for the correction of sin and folly, is a means of making children wise, and of restraining the folly that is bound up in them; and of reclaiming them from those sinful ways, which the folly of their hearts leads them to, and so in some measure of driving it far from them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Foolishness <i>is</i> bound <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> in the heart of a child; <i>but</i> the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</span><p>(l) He is naturally given to it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">bound</span>] Better, <span class="bld">bound up</span>, R.V.

Septuagint, "Folly is attached (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) to the heart of the young," in which version Cornelius a Lapide sees an allusion to the ornament hung by fond parents round the neck of a child whom they were inclined to spoil rather than to train in self-denying ways. To such a child folly adheres as closely as the <span class="accented">bulla</span> with which he is decorated. But <span class="cmt_word">the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</span> Judicious education overcomes this natural tendency, by punishing it when  exhibited, and imparting wisdom and piety (see on Proverbs 13:24 and Proverbs 19:18; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-15.htm">Proverbs 29:15</a>; Ecclus. 30:1, etc). The LXX. pursue their notion of the the indulgent parents letting the child have his own way, for they render the last clause, "But the rod and discipline are far from him." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>9 He who is friendly is blessed;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he giveth of his bread to the poor.<p>The thought is the same as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; (thus to be written without Makkeph, with Munach of the first word, with correct Codd., also 1294 and Jaman), the contrast of &#1512;&#1506; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-22.htm">Proverbs 22:22</a>, i.e., the envious, evil-eyed, ungracious (post-bibl. also &#1510;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503;), is one who looks kindly, is good-hearted, and as &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, shows himself benevolent. Such gentleness and kindness is called in the Mishna &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; (Aboth ii. 13), or &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1497;&#1508;&#1492;. Such a friend is blessed, for he has also himself scattered blessings (cf. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-13.htm">Proverbs 21:13</a>); he has, as is said, looking back from the blessing that has happened to him, given of his bread (Luther, as the lxx, with partitive genitive: seines brots  equals  of his bread) to the poor; cf. the unfolding of this blessing of self-denying love, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/8.htm">Isaiah 8</a>.
