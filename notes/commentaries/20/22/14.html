Divine Providence has so ordered it, that some are rich, and others poor, but all are guilty before God; and at the throne of God's grace the poor are as welcome as the rich. 3. Faith foresees the evil coming upon sinners, and looks to Jesus Christ as the sure refuge from the storm. 4. Where the fear of God is, there will be humility. And much is to be enjoyed by it; spiritual riches, and eternal life at last. 5. The way of sin is vexatious and dangerous. But the way of duty is safe and easy. 6. Train children, not in the way they would go, that of their corrupt hearts, but in the way they should go; in which, if you love them, you would have them go. As soon as possible every child should be led to the knowledge of the Saviour. 7. This shows how important it is for every man to keep out of debt. As to the things of this life, there is a difference between the rich and the poor; but let the poor remember, it is the Lord that made the difference. 8. The power which many abuse, will soon fail them. 9. He that seeks to relieve the wants and miseries of others shall be blessed. 10. Profane scoffers and revilers disturb the peace. 11. God will be the Friend of a man in whose spirit there is no guile; this honour have all the saints. 12. God turns the counsels and designs of treacherous men to their own confusion. 13. The slothful man talks of a lion without, but considers not his real danger from the devil, that roaring lion within, and from his own slothfulness, which kills him. 14. The vile sin of licentiousness commonly besots the mind beyond recovery. 15. Sin is foolishness, it is in the heart, there is an inward inclination to sin: children bring it into the world with them; and it cleaves close to the soul. We all need to be corrected by our heavenly Father. 16. We are but stewards, and must distribute what God intrusts to our care, according to his will.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fall of the man into the snare of the harlot seems to be the consequence of the abhorrence or wrath of Yahweh.

The mouth of harlots; the kisses of their mouth, their fair speech and flattering words, their amorous talk, and lascivious and wanton language, ensnare and draw unwary persons to commit lewdness with them, which bring them into a pit of ruin and destruction; a filthy one, and very deep, out of which it is not easy nor usual to be extricated: the allusion is to beasts taken in a pit dug for them; and these are as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed; <p>he that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein; who has been guilty of other sins, and such as have caused the Lord to abhor him, and therefore leaves him to fall into this: one sin not only leads on to another, but is the punishment of another; men are seldom guilty of this sin of whoredom, but who have been first abandoned to other vices very provoking to. God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>. Jarchi interprets all this of idolatry; and it may be very well applied to the whore of Rome, and the harlots she is mother of; who, by her fair words and false doctrines, by her mouth speaking blasphemies and lies in hypocrisy, by her golden cup in her hand full of abomination and filthiness of fornication, and by her sorceries, have deceived many, and brought them into the pit of perdition and ruin: and these are such whose names are not written in the Lamb's book of life; but are rejected of God, and given up to believe a lie, that they might be damned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The mouth of strange women <i>is</i> a deep pit: he that is abhorred by the LORD <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> shall fall in it.</span><p>(k) So God punishes one sin by another, when he suffers the wicked to fall into the acquaintance of a harlot.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">a deep pit</span>] such as is dug by a hunter for his prey. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-27.htm" title="For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.">Proverbs 23:27</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mouth of strange women is a deep pit.</span> The hemistich reappears in a slightly altered form at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27</a>. (For "strange woman" as equivalent to "a harlot" or "adulteress," see note on Proverbs 2:16.) By her "mouth" is meant her wanton, seductive words, which entice a man to destruction of body and soul. It may be that theology rather than morals is signified here - rather false doctrines than evil practice. In this case the mention of the strange or foreign woman is very appropriate, seeing that perversions of belief and worship were always introduced into Israel from external sources. <span class="cmt_word">He that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein.</span> He who has incurred the width of God by previous unfaithfulness and sin is left to himself to fall a prey to the allurements of the wicked woman (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>). Septuagint, "The mouth of a transgressor (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) is a deep ditch; and he that is hated of the Lord shall fall therein." Then are added three lines not in the Hebrew, which, however, seem to be reminiscences of other passages: "There are evil ways before a man, and be loveth not to turn away from them; but it is needful to turn away item a perverse and evil way." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The group now following extends to the end of this first collection of Solomon's proverbs; it closes also with a proverb of the poor and the rich.<p>8 He that soweth iniquity shall reap calamity;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rod of his fury shall vanish away.<p>"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>); he that soweth good reapeth good, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>; he that soweth evil reapeth evil, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>. &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; is the direct contrast of &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; or &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-3.htm">Psalm 125:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-42.htm">Psalm 107:42</a>), proceeding from the idea that the good is right, i.e., straight, rectum; the evil, that which departs from the straight line, and is crooked. Regarding &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, which means both perversity of mind and conduct, as well as destiny, calamity, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-21.htm">Proverbs 12:21</a>. That which the poet particularly means by &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; is shown in 8b, viz., unsympathizing tyranny, cruel misconduct toward a neighbour. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; is the rod which he who soweth iniquity makes another to feel in his anger. The saying, that an end will be to this rod of his fury, agrees with that which is said of the despot's sceptre, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-5.htm">Isaiah 14:5</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/125-3.htm">Psalm 125:3</a>. Rightly Fleischer: baculus insolentiae ejus consumetur h. e. facultas qua pollet alios insolenter tractandi evanescet. Hitzig's objection, that a rod does not vanish away, but is broken, is answered by this, that the rod is thought of as brandished; besides, one uses &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; of anything which has an end, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-4.htm">Isaiah 16:4</a>. Other interpreters understand "the rod of his fury" of the rod of God's anger, which will strike the &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500; and &#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1492;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a> : "and the rod of His punishment will surely come" (Ewald, and similarly Schultens, Euchel, Umbreit). This though also hovers before the lxx: &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;&#1493;) &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; (&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;). But if the rod of punishment which is appointed for the unrighteous be meant, then we would have expected &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;. Taken in the future, the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; is not its confectio in the sense of completion, but its termination or annihilation; and besides, it lies nearer after 8a to take the suffix of &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493; subjectively (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-6.htm">Isaiah 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-6.htm">Isaiah 16:6</a>) than objectively. The lxx has, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a>, a distich: - <p>&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;<p>&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;.<p>The first line (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>) is a variant translation of 9a (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-17.htm">Proverbs 21:17</a>), the second (&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;&#1493;) is a similar rendering of 8b. </body></html>
