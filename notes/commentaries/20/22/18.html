To these words, to this knowledge, the ear must be bowed down, and the heart applied by faith and love. To live a life of delight in God and dependence on him, is the foundation of all practical religion. The way to know the certainty of the word of truth, is to make conscience of our duty. 22,23. He that robs and oppresses the poor, does so at his peril. And if men will not appear for them, God will. 24,25.

On the other hand, after "to preserve," in the sense of watching, guarding a concrete object is to be expected, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>. We need not thus with Ewald supply &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;; the ancients are right that &#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, knowledge, stands metonymically for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (Meri), or &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; (Aben Ezra), or &#1497;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1497; &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; (Arama); Schultens rightly: Cognitio veritatis ac virtutis practica fertur ad homines eam colentes ac praestantes. Where knowledge of the true and the good exists, there does it stand under the protection of God. 12b shows how that is meant, for there the perf. is continued in the second consec. modus (fut. consec.): there is thus protection against the assaults of enemies who oppose the knowledge which they hate, and seek to triumph over it, and to suppress it by their crooked policy. But God stands on the side of knowledge and protects it, and consequently makes vain the words (the outspoken resolutions) of the deceitful. Regarding &#1505;&#1500;&#1507; (&#1505;&#1500;&#1507;), vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-3.htm">Proverbs 19:3</a>. The meaning of &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is here essentially different from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a> : he perverteth their words, for he giveth them a bearing that is false, i.e., not leading to the end. Hitzig reads &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; [wickedness] for &#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, which Zckler is inclined to favour: God keeps the evil which is done in His eyes, and hinders its success; but "to observe wickedness" is an ambiguous, untenable expression; the only passage that can be quoted in favour of this "to observe" is <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>. The word &#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, handed down without variation, is much rather justified. </body></html>
