FIRST APPENDIX TO THE “PROVERBS OF SOLOMON” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-1.htm" title="The proverbs of Solomon.

Do not take advantage of his poverty. Or, this clause may be considered as an argument against robbing him; as if he had said, Because he is a fitter object for thy pity and charity, than for thy injustice and cruelty; it is base and inhuman to crush such a person. <span class="ital">Neither oppress the afflicted in the gate — </span>In the place of judgment, or under pretence of justice; and much less in other ways, where there is no colour of justice. <span class="ital">For the Lord will plead their cause — </span>Which he hath in a peculiar manner undertaken to do; <span class="ital">and </span>will <span class="ital">spoil the soul of those that spoiled them — </span>Will take away not only their goods, but their lives too.

To these words, to this knowledge, the ear must be bowed down, and the heart applied by faith and love. To live a life of delight in God and dependence on him, is the foundation of all practical religion. The way to know the certainty of the word of truth, is to make conscience of our duty. 22,23. He that robs and oppresses the poor, does so at his peril. And if men will not appear for them, God will. 24,25. Our corrupt hearts have so much tinder in them, that it is dangerous to have to do with those that throw about the sparks of their passion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>i. e., "Do not be tempted by the helplessness of the poor man to do him wrong:" some prefer, "Refrain from doing him wrong through pity for his helplessness."<p>The gate - The place where the rulers of the city sit in judgment.

And cannot help himself; cannot go to law with him that has injured him, and defend his own cause; which the other knowing, is the more emboldened to spoil and defraud him, which is an aggravation of his sin: or, "for he is poor" (g); to rob any man is an evil and an injurious thing; but to rob the poor is cruel and barbarous; rather something should be given them, and not anything taken from them: or, "though he is poor" (h); let not that be an inducement to injure him, but the contrary; <p>neither oppress the afflicted in the gate; or "the poor" (i); the same as before, only a different word used: when he comes into a court of judicature, which was usually held in the gates of a city, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>; and applies for redress of any grievance, do not crush him in the gate, or oppress him in judgment; nor wrest his cause, and do him wrong; but let him have justice done him, though poor. Some understand this of using the poor ill, when they come to their gates to beg; which sense is favoured by the Septuagint version; but the former is best. One might have expected, after such a preface or introduction as in the preceding verses, that something of more importance, something more spiritual and evangelical, would have followed: this shows the great regard the Lord has to the poor, and how much they are on his mind, and how near they lie to his heart; especially the poor of the flock, worried and spoiled by antichrist; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-7.htm">Zechariah 11:7</a>. <p>(g)   "nam tenuis est", so some in Mercerus.

The warning points to the particular form of wrong inflicted on the lowly by unjust judges, who could give sentences from which, however iniquitous, there was practically no appeal. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16 Whosoever oppresseth the lowly, it is gain to him;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whosoever giveth to the rich, it is only loss.<p>It is before all clear that &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>, &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#1512; and &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512;, are contrasted words, and form the conclusions to the participles used, with the force of hypothetical antecedents. Jerome recognises this: qui calumniatur pauperem, ut augeat divitias suas, dabit ipse ditiori et egebit. So Rashi, who by &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512; thinks on heathen potentates. Proportionally better Euchel, referring &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; and &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, not to one person, but to two classes of men: he who oppresses the poor to enrich himself, and is liberal toward the rich, falls under want. The antithetic distich thus becomes an integral one - the antithesis manifestly intended is not brought out. This may be said also against Bertheau, who too ingeniously explains: He who oppresses the poor to enrich himself gives to a rich man, i.e., to himself, the enriched, only to want, i.e., only to lose again that which he gained unrighteously. Ralbag is on the right track, for he suggests the explanation: he who oppresses the poor, does it to his gain, for he thereby impels him to a more energetic exercise of his strength; he who gives to the rich man does it to his own loss, because the rich man does not thank him for it, and still continues to look down on him. But if one refers &#1500;&#1468;&#1493; to the poor, then it lies nearer to interpret &#1488;&#1498; &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1505;&#1493;&#1512; of the rich: he who gives presents to the rich only thereby promotes his sleepy indolence, and so much the more robs him of activity (Elster); for that which one gives to him is only swallowed up in the whirlpool of his extravagance (Zckler). Thus Hitzig also explains, who remarks, under 17a: "Oppression produces reaction, awakens energy, and thus God on the whole overrules events" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-12.htm">Exodus 1:12</a>). Similarly also Ewald, who thinks on a mercenary, unrighteous rich man: God finally lifts up the oppressed poor man; the rich man always becoming richer, on the contrary, is "punished for all his wickedness only more and more." But with all these explanations there is too much read between the lines. Since &#1488;&#1498; &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1491;&#1493;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-24.htm">Proverbs 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>) refers back to the subject: himself to mere loss, so also will it be here; and the lxx, Symmachus, Jerome (cf. also the Syr. auget malum suum) are right when they also refer &#1500;&#1493;, not to the poor man, but to the oppressor of the poor. We explain: he who extorts from the poor enriches himself thereby; but he who gives to the rich has nothing, and less than nothing, thereby - he robs himself, has no thanks, only brings himself by many gifts lower and lower down. In the first case at least, 17a, the result corresponds to the intention; but in this latter case, 17b, one gains only bitter disappointment. </body></html>
