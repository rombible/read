To these words, to this knowledge, the ear must be bowed down, and the heart applied by faith and love. To live a life of delight in God and dependence on him, is the foundation of all practical religion. The way to know the certainty of the word of truth, is to make conscience of our duty. 22,23. He that robs and oppresses the poor, does so at his peril. And if men will not appear for them, God will. 24,25.

In the Scriptures. Some render it, "three things" (c); and think that Solomon refers to the three divisions of the Scriptures among the Jews, the law, the prophets, and holy writings; so Jarchi; but some of those writings then were not: or to the three books wrote by him; the Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. Others render it, "in a threefold way" (d), as the Targum and several versions; that is, in various ways, in different forms and styles, in order the better to inform and instruct. But it is best, with Kimchi, Gersom, and Ben Melech, to render it, "excellent things", as we do; such are the truths of the Gospel; they are more excellent than those that are only known by the light of nature, or by the law of Moses: such as suspect the love and grace of God; the person and offices of Christ; peace, pardon, righteousness, atonement, life and salvation, by him. And these are said to lie <p>in counsels and knowledge; in disclosing the counsels of God, according to which they are; in giving the best of counsels to men; to perishing sinners, to look to Christ for salvation; to naked ones, to buy of him white raiment, or the robe of his righteousness; to guilty and filthy ones, to apply to his blood for pardon and cleansing; to hungry and thirsty ones, to come unto him for food, the bread of life, and water of life; and to weary ones, to him for rest; and all to do their duty both to God and men: and they also respect knowledge; the knowledge of divine and heavenly things; the knowledge of God in Christ, and of his perfections, as displayed in his salvation; the knowledge of Christ, what he is in himself, what he has done for his people, and is unto them; and especially the knowledge of salvation by him; all which the Gospel is a means of. <p>(c) "terna", Montanus, Vatablus, so Jarchi.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-6.htm" title="Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.">Proverbs 8:6</a> “excellent things” are literally princely things or words. The LXX. and Vulg., however, render the word literally, “thrice,” or “in threefold form,” <span class="greekheb">τρισσῶς</span>, tripliciter, possibly with the idea of reiteration to impress the lesson.

If this be adopted, the reference may be either to the earlier sections of this Book, or to the fact that what is now promulgated had been committed to writing long ago, and was therefore no hasty utterance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This passage has borne a prominent part in the history of Biblical exegesis. By it, understood (with the LXX. and Vulg. quoted above) of “threefold” teaching, or teaching “in triple form,” Origen supported his doctrine of the threefold meaning of Holy Scripture. “By Solomon in the Proverbs,” he writes, “we find some such rule as this enjoined respecting the divine doctrines of Scripture: ‘And do thou portray them in a threefold manner, in counsel and knowledge, to answer words of truth to them who propose them to thee.’ ” And so, he adds, comparing the threefold sense of Scripture to the tripartite division of man into body, soul and spirit, the simple will be edified, “by the flesh,” or obvious sense of Scripture, and the more advanced by its “soul,” while the perfect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:...">1 Corinthians 2:6-7</a>) may attain to the spiritual law itself, <span class="ital">De Princip</span>.

The Khetib has <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, "the day before yesterday, formerly;" but the word occurs nowhere alone, and, as Nowack says, can hardly have been the original reading. However, Ewald, Bertheau, and others, adopting it, suppose that the author refers to some earlier work. Cheyne cites Bickell's rendering, "Now, years before now, have I written unto thee long before with counsels and knowledge," and considers the words to mean either that the compiler took a long time over his work, or that this was not the first occasion of his writing. One does not see why stress should be here laid on former instruction, unless, perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, in contrast to "this day" of the previous verse. The LXX. renders the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> thus, "And do thou record them for thyself triply for counsel and knowledge upon the table of thine heart." St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Ecce descripsi eam tibi tripliciter, in cogitationibus et scientiis.</span> Other versions have also given a numerical explanation to the term. In it is seen an allusion to the three supposed works of Solomon - Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles - which is absurd; others refer it to the threefold division of the Testament - Law, Prophets, and Hagiographa; others, to three classes of youths for whom the admonitious were intended; others, again, think it equivalent to "oftentimes," or "in many forms." But the reading is as doubtful as the explanations of it are unsatisfactory. The genuine word is doubtless preserved in the Keri, which gives <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shalishim</span>), properly a military term, applied to chariot fighters and men of rank in the army. The LXX. translates the word by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>), which is equivalent to "chieftain." Hence the Hebrew term, understood in the neuter gender, is transferred to the chief among proverbs - "choice proverbs," as Delitzsch calls them. The Venetian, by a happy turn, gives <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>.
