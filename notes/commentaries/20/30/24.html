We may learn from animals to go well; also to keep our temper under all provocations. We must keep the evil thought in our minds from breaking out into evil speeches. We must not stir up the passions of others. Let nothing be said or done with violence, but every thing with softness and calmness. Alas, how often have we done foolishly in rising up against the Lord our King! Let us humble ourselves before him.

These verses provide two classes of apt illustrations of various aspects of the moral world, which the reader is left to apply. By the first (Pr 30:25-28), diligence and providence are commended; the success of these insignificant animals being due to their instinctive sagacity and activity, rather than strength. The other class (Pr 30:30, 31) provides similes for whatever is majestic or comely, uniting efficiency with gracefulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Comparatively to other brute creatures. They act very wisely and providently, not from any reason which they have, but by the direction of Divine Providence, which secretly guides them to do those things for their own preservation which are most agreeable to the rules of wisdom.

On the other hand, &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1506; (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, for with the Ker&#305;&#770;, conforming to 18a, &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;) has to be interpreted as object. accus. The introduction of four things that are not known is in expressions like <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a>. The turning-point lies in the fourth; to that point the other three expressions gravitate, which have not an object in themselves, but are only as folie to the fourth. The articles wanting after &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;: they would be only the marks of the gender, and are therefore unnecessary; cf. under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>. And while &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, in the heavens, and &#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1470;&#1497;&#1501;, in the sea, are the expressions used, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is used for on the rock, because here "on" is not at the same time "in," "within," as the eagle cleaves the air and the ship the waves. For this same reason the expression, "the way of a man &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;," is not to be understood of love unsought, suddenly taking possession of and captivating a man toward this or that maid, so that the principal thought of the proverb may be compared to the saying, "marriages are made in heaven;" but, as in Kidduschin 2b, with reference to this passage, is said coitus via appellatur. The &#1489; refers to copula carnalis. But in what respect did his understanding not reach to this? "Wonderful," thus Hitzig explains as the best interpreter of this opinion elsewhere (cf. Psychol. p. 115) propounded, "appeared to him the flying, and that how a large and thus heavy bird could raise itself so high in the air (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-27.htm">Job 39:27</a>); then how, over the smooth rock, which offers no hold, the serpent pushes itself along; finally, how the ship in the trackless waves, which present nothing to the eye as a guide, nevertheless finds its way. These three things have at the same time this in common, that they leave no trace of their pathway behind them. But of the fourth way that cannot be said; for the trace is left on the substrat, which the man &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, and it becomes manifest, possibly as pregnancy, keeping out of view that the &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; may yet be &#1489;&#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;. That which is wonderful is consequently only the coition itself, its mystical act and its incomprehensible consequences." But does not this interpretation carry in itself its own refutation? To the three wonderful ways which leave no traces behind them, there cannot be compared a fourth, the consequences of which are not only not trackless, but, on the contrary, become manifest as proceeding from the act in an incomprehensible way. The point of comparison is either the wonderfulness of the event or the tracklessness of its consequences. But now "the way of a man &#1489;&#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;" is altogether inappropriate to designate the wonderful event of the origin of a human being. How altogether differently the Chokma expresses itself on this matter is seen from <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a> (cf. Psychol. p. 210). That "way of a man with a maid" denotes only the act of coition, which physiologically differs in nothing from that of the lower animals, and which in itself, in the externality of its accomplishment, the poet cannot possibly call something transcendent. And why did he use the word &#1489;&#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;, and not rather &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1492; [with a female] or &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; [id.]? For this reason, because he meant the act of coition, not as a physiological event, but as a historical occurrence, as it takes place particularly in youth as the goal of love, not always reached in the divinely-appointed way. The point of comparison hence is not the secret of conception, but the tracelessness of the carnal intercourse. Now it is also clear why the way of the serpent &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1510;&#1493;&#1512; was in his eye: among grass, and still more in sand, the trace of the serpent's path would perhaps be visible, but not on a hard stone, over which it has glided. And it is clear why it is said of the ship &#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1470;&#1497;&#1501; [in the heart of the sea]: while the ship is still in sight from the land, one knows the track it follows; but who can in the heart of the sea, i.e., on the high sea, say that here or there a ship has ploughed the water, since the water-furrows have long ago disappeared? Looking to the heavens, one cannot say that an eagle has passed there; to the rock, that a serpent has wound its way over it; to the high sea, that a ship has been steered through it; to the maid, that a man has had carnal intercourse with her. That the fact might appear on nearer investigation, although this will not always guide to a certain conclusion, is not kept in view; only the outward appearance is spoken of, the intentional concealment (Rashi) being in this case added thereto. Sins against the sixth [ equals  seventh] commandment remain concealed from human knowledge, and are distinguished from others by this, that they shun human cognition (as the proverb says: &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1496;&#1512;&#1493;&#1508;&#1493;&#1505; &#1500;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, there is for sins of the flesh no &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;) - unchastity can mask itself, the marks of chastity are deceitful, here only the All-seeing Eye (&#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, Aboth ii. 1) perceives that which is done. Yet it is not maintained that "the way of a man with a maid" refers exclusively to external intercourse; but altogether on this side the proverb gains ethical significance. Regarding &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; (from &#1506;&#1500;&#1501;, pubes esse et caeundi cupidus, not from &#1506;&#1500;&#1501;, to conceal, and not, as Schultens derives it, from &#1506;&#1500;&#1501;, signare, to seal) as distinguished from &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>. The mark of maidenhood belongs to &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; not in the same way as to &#1489;&#1514;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-43.htm">Genesis 24:43</a> with 16), but only the marks of puberty and youth; the wife &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; (viz., &#1488;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;) cannot as such be called &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492;. Ralbag's gloss &#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; is incorrect, and in Arama's explanation (Akeda, Abschn. 9): the time is not to be determined when the sexual love of the husband to his wife flames out, ought to have been &#1493;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; ne. One has therefore to suppose that <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-20.htm">Proverbs 30:20</a> explains what is meant by "the way of a man with a maid" by a strong example (for "the adulterous woman" can mean only an old adulteress), there not inclusive, for the tracklessness of sins of the flesh in their consequences.<p>This 20th verse does not appear to have been an original part of the numerical proverb, but is an appendix thereto (Hitzig). If we assume that &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; points forwards: thus as follows is it with the... (Fleischer), then we should hold this verse as an independent cognate proverb; but where is there a proverb (except <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-19.htm">Proverbs 11:19</a>) that begins with &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;? &#1499;&#1503;, which may mean eodem modo (for one does not say &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;) as well as eo modo, here points backwards in the former sense. Instead of &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; (not &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;; for the attraction of that which follows, brought about by the retrogression of the tone of the first word, requires dageshing, Thorath Emeth, p. 30) the lxx has merely &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, i.e., as Immanuel explains: &#1502;&#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1492;, abstergens semet ipsam, with Grotius, who to tergens os suum adds the remark: &#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (honesta elocutio). But eating is just a figure, like the "secret bread," <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17</a>, and the wiping of the mouth belongs to this figure. This appendix, with its &#1499;&#1503;, confirms it, that the intention of the four ways refers to the tracklessness of the consequences. </body></html>
