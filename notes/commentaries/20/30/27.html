Four things that are little, are yet to be admired. There are those who are poor in the world, and of small account, yet wise for their souls and another world. 29-33. We may learn from animals to go well; also to keep our temper under all provocations. We must keep the evil thought in our minds from breaking out into evil speeches. We must not stir up the passions of others. Let nothing be said or done with violence, but every thing with softness and calmness. Alas, how often have we done foolishly in rising up against the Lord our King! Let us humble ourselves before him. And having found peace with Him, let us follow peace with all men.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-7.htm">Joel 2:7-8</a>; the most striking fact in the flight of the locust-swarms was their apparent order and discipline, sweeping over the land like the invasion of a great army. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. conies&#8212;mountain mice, or rabbits.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Have no king</span> to rule and order them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By bands; </span> in great numbers, and in several companies, and in exact order, as is observed in Scripture, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-5.htm" title="For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.">Judges 6:5</a> 7:12 <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-6.htm" title="For a nation is come up on my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the cheek teeth of a great lion.">Joel 1:6</a> 2:7</span>, and by other writers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The locusts have no king,....

There are, up to this point, two numerical proverbs which begin with &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-7.htm">Proverbs 30:7</a>, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>; after the cipher 2 there then, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-18.htm">Proverbs 30:18</a>, followed the cipher 3, which is now here continued:<p>21 Under three things doth the earth tremble,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And under four can it not stand:<p>22 Under a servant when he becomes king,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a profligate when he has bread enough;<p>23 Under an unloved woman when she is married,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a maid-servant when she becomes heiress to her mistress.<p>We cannot say here that the 4 falls into 3 + 1; but the four consists of four ones standing beside one another. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is here without pausal change, although the Athnach here, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-24.htm">Proverbs 30:24</a>, where the modification of sound occurs, divides the verse into two; &#1502;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, 14b (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>), remains, on the other hand, correctly unchanged. The "earth" stands here, as frequently, instead of the inhabitants of the earth. It trembles when one of the four persons named above comes and gains free space for acting; it feels itself oppressed as by an insufferable burden (an expression similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10</a>); - the arrangement of society is shattered; an oppressive closeness of the air, as it were, settles over all minds. The first case is already designated, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10</a>, as improper: under a slave, when he comes to reign (quum rex fit); for suppose that such an one has reached the place of government, not by the murder of the king and by the robbery of the crown, but, as is possible in an elective monarchy, by means of the dominant party of the people, he will, as a rule, seek to indemnify himself in his present highness for his former lowliness, and in the measure of his rule show himself unable to rise above his servile habits, and to pass out of the limited circle of his earlier state. The second case is this: a &#1504;&#1489;&#1500;, one whose mind is perverted and whose conduct is profligate - in short, a low man (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>) - &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1470;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501; (cf. Metheg-Setzung, 28), i.e., has enough to eat (cf. to the expression <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-19.htm">Proverbs 28:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>); for this undeserved living without care and without want makes him only so much the more arrogant, and troublesome, and dangerous. The &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, in the second case, is not thought of as a spouse, and that, as in supposed polygamy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-31.htm">Genesis 29:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>, as fallen into disfavour, but who again comes to favour and honour (Dathe, Rosenmller); for she can be &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; without her own fault, and as such she is yet no &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;; and it is not to be perceived why the re-assumption of such an one should shatter social order. Rightly Hitzig, and, after his example, Zckler: an unmarried lady, an old spinster, is meant, whom no one desired because she had nothing attractive, and was only repulsive (cf. Grimm, under Sir. 7:26b). If such an one, as &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1489;&#1506;&#1500; says, at length, however, finds her husband and enters into the married relation, then she carries her head so much the higher; for she gives vent to ill-humour, strengthened by long restraint, against her subordinates; then she richly requites her earlier and happily married companions for their depreciation of her, among whom she had to suffer, as able to find no one who would love her. In the last case it is asked whether &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is meant of inheriting as an heiress (Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion, the Targ., Jerome, the Venet., and Luther), or supplanting (Euchel, Gesenius, Hitzig), i.e., an entering into the inheritance of the dead, or an entering into the place of a living mistress. Since &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, with the accus. of the person, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-3.htm">Genesis 15:3-4</a>, signifies to be the heir of one, and only with the accus. of peoples and lands signifies, "to take into possession (to seize) by supplanting," the former is to be preferred; the lxx (Syr.), &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#837;, appear to have read &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1514;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;. This &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; would certainly be, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-10.htm">Genesis 21:10</a>, a piece of the world turned upside down; but also the entering, as heiress, into the inheritance, makes the maid-servant the reverse of that which she was before, and brings with it the danger that the heiress, notwithstanding her want of culture and dignity, demean herself also as heiress of the rank. Although the old Israelitish law knew only intestate succession to an inheritance, yet there also the case might arise, that where there were no natural or legal heirs, the bequest of a wife of rank passed over to her servants and nurses. </body></html>
