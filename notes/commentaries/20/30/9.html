There is a remarkable similarity between this prayer and several clauses of the Lord's prayer. If we are removed from vanity and lies; if we are interested in the pardoning love of Christ, and have him for our portion; if we walk with God, then we shall have all we can ask or think, as to spiritual things. When we consider how those who have abundance are prone to abuse the gift, and what it is to suffer want, Agur's prayer will ever be found a wise one, though seldom offered. Food convenient; what is so for one, may not be so for another; but we may be sure that our heavenly Father will supply all our need, and not suffer us to want anything good for us; and why should we wish for more?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The special dangers of the two extremes.

This is the dangerous consequence of riches, and the temptation they expose men unto; who, being full of the things of this world, are tempted to deny the Lord; not his being and perfections directly, but chiefly his providence; to deny that what they have, they have received of him, but attribute it to their own care, diligence, and industry; and now think they can live without him, without any dependence on his providence, having a large affluence of the things of life: yea, they may be said to deny him, when they forget the bounties of his providence; are not thankful to him for them; that flatter themselves with a continuance of them, without any regard to him, as if he had no concern in the affairs of life; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <p>and say, Who is the Lord? as Pharaoh did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>.

Agur, a good man, is desirous he might not be exposed to temptations to such evils, and especially which so affected the honour and glory of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Lest I be full, and deny <i>thee</i>, and say, <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> Who <i>is</i> the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God <i>in vain</i>.</span><p>(f) Meaning, that they who put their trust in their riches forget God and that by too much wealth men have an opportunity to the same.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">take</span> … in vain] <span class="ital">use profanely</span>, R.V.

In this case the ground of the request would embrace both parts of the petition. <span class="cmt_word">Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord</span> (<span class="accented">Jehovah</span>)? Great wealth and temporal prosperity tempt to forgetfulness of God, to self-confidence and practical unbelief in Divine providence. Like Pharaoh, the haughty rich man asks with scorn, "Who is the Lord, that I should obey his voice?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-12.htm">Deuteronomy 8:12</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-14.htm">Job 21:14</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). Septuagint, "Lest being filled I become false, and say, Who seeth me?" <span class="cmt_word">Or lest I be poor, and steal;</span> lest my necessities lead to dishonesty. <span class="cmt_word">And take the name of my God in vain.</span> The verb <span class="accented">taphas</span> means "to grasp at, seize violently, handle roughly," and the sin intended may be either false swearing in denial of his theft and to escape punishment, or the arraignment of God's providence which has allowed him to fall into such distress. Titus <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>, "They shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God." In view of the proverbs that follow, the clause seems to be best taken of the blasphemy attending on impatience and want of resignation to God's will (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-3.htm">Proverbs 19:3</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The &#1499;&#1497; now following confirms the fruitlessness of the long zealous search:<p>2 For I am without reason for a man,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And a man's understanding I have not.<p>3 And I have not learned wisdom,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That I may possess the knowledge of the All-Holy.<p>He who cannot come to any fixed state of consecration, inasmuch as he is always driven more and more back from the goal he aims at, thereby brings guilt upon himself as a sinner so great, that every other man stands above him, and he is deep under them all. So here Agur finds the reason why in divine things he has failed to attain unto satisfying intelligence, not in the ignorance and inability common to all men - he appears to himself as not a man at all, but as an irrational beast, and he misses in himself the understanding which a man properly might have and ought to have. The &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is not the partitive, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-11.htm">Isaiah 44:11</a>, not the usual comparative: than any one (Bttcher), which ought to be expressed by &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, but it is the negative, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14</a>; Fleischer: rudior ego sum quam ut homo appeller, or: brutus ego, hominis non similis. Regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-1.htm">Proverbs 12:1</a>.<p>(Note: According to the Arab. &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; is not a beast as grazing, but as dropping stercus (ba'r, camel's or sheep's droppings); to the R. &#1489;&#1512;, Mhlau rightly gives the meanings of separating, whence are derived the meanings of grazing as well as of removing (cleansing) (cf. Pers. thak karadn, to make clean  equals  to make clean house, tabula rasa).)<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-3.htm">Proverbs 30:3</a> now says that he went into no school of wisdom, and for that reason in his wrestling after knowledge could attain to nothing, because the necessary conditions to this were wanting to him. But then the question arises: Why this complaint? He must first go to school in order to obtain, according to the word "To him who hath is given," that for which he strove. Thus &#1500;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; refers to learning in the midst of wrestling; but &#1500;&#1502;&#1491;, spiritually understood, signifies the acquiring of a kennens [knowledge] or knnens [knowledge  equals  ability]: he has not brought it out from the deep point of his condition of knowledge to make wisdom his own, so that he cannot adjudge to himself knowledge of the all-holy God (for this knowledge is the kernel and the star of true wisdom). If we read 3b &#1500;&#1488; &#1488;&#1491;&#1506;, this would be synchronistic, nesciebam, with &#1500;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514;&#1497; standing on the same line. On the contrary, the positive &#1488;&#1491;&#1506; subordinates itself to &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1500;&#1502;&#1491;&#1514;&#1497;, as the Arab. fa&#770;a' lama, in the sense of (ita) ut scirem scientiam Sanctissimi, thus of a conclusion, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-19.htm">Lamentations 1:19</a>, a clause expressive of the intention, Ewald, 347a. &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, the name of God in a superlative sense, like the Arab. el-kuddu&#770;s. </body></html>
