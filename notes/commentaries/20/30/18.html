But for more on this text the reader is referred to Schultens’s very accurate discussion of it. Houbigant thinks that the sacred writer here refers to the human conception; which is indeed truly miraculous and incomprehensible.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:10 Slander not a servant to his master, accuse him not in small matters, to make mischief. 11-14. In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat their parents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose hearts are full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are others whose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters in every age. 15-17. Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, that still cry, Give, give, and they are continually uneasy to themselves. Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared. Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have come to a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despising their parents' authority. 18-20. Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full of marvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by which a vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which a vile woman uses to conceal her wickedness. 21-23 Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and base spirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent men indulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicious habits. A servant who has obtained undue influence. Let those whom Providence has advanced from low beginnings, carefully watch against that sin which most easily besets them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Another enigma.

The facts are marvellous; Agur feels like Job, "I have uttered that which I understood not, things too wonderful for me, which I knew not" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follows a Priamel,<p>(Note: Cf. vol. i. p. 13. The name (from praeambulum) given to a peculiar form of popular gnomic poetry which prevailed in Germany from the 12th (e.g., the Meistersinger or Minstrel Sparvogel) to the 16th century, but was especially cultivated during the 14th and 15th centuries. Its peculiarity consisted in this, that after a series of antecedents or subjects, a briefly-expressed consequent or predicate was introduced as the epigrammatic point applicable to all these antecedents together. Vid., Erschenburg's Denkmlern altdeutscher Dichtkinst, Bremen 1799.)<p>the first line of which is, by &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;, connected with the &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;&#1498; of the preceding distich:<p>11 A generation that curseth their father,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And doth not bless their mother;<p>12 A generation pure in their own eyes,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet not washed from their filthiness;<p>13 A generation - how haughty their eyes,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their eyelids lift themselves up;<p>14 A generation whose teeth are swords and their jaw teeth knives<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To devour the poor from the earth and the needy from the midst of men.<p>Ewald translates: O generation! but that would have required the word, 13a, &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>), and one would have expected to have found something mentioned which the generation addressed were to take heed to; but it is not so. But if "O generation!" should be equivalent to "O regarding the generation!" then &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; ought to have introduced the sentence. And if we translate, with Luther: There is a generation, etc., then &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is supplied, which might drop out, but could not be omitted. The lxx inserts after &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; the word &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, and then renders what follows as pred. - a simple expedient, but worthless. The Venet. does not need this expedient, for it renders &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;; but then the order of the words in 11a would have been &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500; &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;; and in 12a, after the manner of a subst. clause, &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512; &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, one sees distinctly, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-13.htm">Proverbs 30:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>, that what follows &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; is to be understood, not as a pred., but as an attributive clause. As little can we interpret <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>, with Lwenstein, as pred. of the three subj., "it is a generation whose teeth are swords;" that would at least have required the words &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a> is not at all a judgment valid for all the three subjects. The Targ. and Jerome translate correctly, as we above;<p>(Note: The Syr. begins 11a as if &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; were to be supplied.)<p>but by this rendering there are four subjects in the preamble, and the whole appears, since the common pred. is wanting, as a mutilated Priamel. Perhaps the author meant to say: it is such a generation that encompasses us; or: such is an abomination to Jahve; for &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; is a Gesamtheit  equals  totality, generation of men who are bound together by contemporary existence, or homogeneity, or by both, but always a totality; so that these <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11-14</a>, might describe quatuor detestabilia genera hominum (C. B. Michaelis), and yet one generatio, which divide among themselves these four vices, of blackest ingratitude, loathsome self-righteousness, arrogant presumption, and unmerciful covetousness. Similar is the description given in the Mishna Sota ix. 14, of the character of the age in which the Messiah appeared. "The appearance of this age," thus it concludes, "is like the appearance of a dog; a son is not ashamed before his father; to whom will we then look for help? To our Father in heaven!"<p>continued...</body></html>
