The whole word of God. "All Scripture", given by inspiration of God, to which Agur directs, as giving the best account of God, of his name, nature, and perfections; of his Son, person, offices, and grace; being pure, very pure, "purified" (z) like silver, purified in a furnace of earth. The whole of Scripture is pure, free from all falsehood and error; coming from the God of truth, who cannot lie, and therefore called "the Scriptures of truth": every promise is pure as well as precious, made without dissimulation, faithfully performed, and all yea and amen in Christ; every doctrine is pure, free from the mixtures and inventions of men; the sincere milk of the word; consistent and all of a piece, not yea and nay; and tending to promote purity of heart and life; wholesome words, and doctrines according to godliness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <p>he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him; not the word, but God, whose the word is; and which represents him as a proper object of trust, both with respect to things temporal and spiritual, at all times; and as a shield to protect such, by his power and grace, from all their enemies, sin, Satan, and the world, and also from all errors and false doctrines; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-3.htm">Psalm 3:3</a>. <p>(z) "purgatus", Pagninus, Montanus, Tigurine version, Gejerus; "purgatissimus", Junius &amp; Tremellius; Heb.

Every declaration of God in the inspired record, the Torah, is pure, as if refined in the fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>). Vulgate, <span class="accented">Omnis sermo Dei est ignitus</span>; Septuagint, "All the words of God are tried in the fire (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)." God's words are true, sincere, with no mixture of error, certain of accomplishment (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-140.htm">Psalm 119:140</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He is a shield.</span> He is perfect protection to all those who, relying on the word of revelation, fly to him for refuge (see on Proverbs 2:7). The knowledge of God is obtained in two ways - by his revelation in his Word, and by the experience of those who trust in him. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A similar gen. connection to that between &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; exists between &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1470;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;:<p>Many seek the countenance of the ruler;<p>Yet from Jahve cometh the judgment of men.<p>Line first is a variation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-6.htm">Proverbs 19:6</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>. It lies near to interpret &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; as gen. obj.: the judgment regarding any one, i.e., the estimating of the man, the decision regarding him; and it is also possible, for &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/17-2.htm">Psalm 17:2</a>, may be understood of the judgment which I have, as well as of the judgment pronounced regarding me (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-59.htm">Lamentations 3:59</a>). But the usage appears to think of the genit. after &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; always as subjective, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>, of the decision which the lot brings, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-6.htm">Job 36:6</a>, the right to which the poor have a claim; so that thus in the passage before us &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; means the right of a man, as that which is proper or fitting to him, the judgment of a man, as that to which as appropriate he has a claim (lxx &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;). Whether the genit. be rendered in the one way or the other, the meaning remains the same: it is not the ruler who finally decides the fate and determines the worth of a man, as they appear to think who with eye-service court his favour and fawn upon him. </body></html>
