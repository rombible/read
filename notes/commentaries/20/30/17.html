In every age there are monsters of ingratitude who ill-treat their parents. Many persuade themselves they are holy persons, whose hearts are full of sin, and who practise secret wickedness. There are others whose lofty pride is manifest. There have also been cruel monsters in every age. 15-17. Cruelty and covetousness are two daughters of the horseleech, that still cry, Give, give, and they are continually uneasy to themselves. Four things never are satisfied, to which these devourers are compared. Those are never rich that are always coveting. And many who have come to a bad end, have owned that their wicked courses began by despising their parents' authority. 18-20. Four things cannot be fully known. The kingdom of nature is full of marvels. The fourth is a mystery of iniquity; the cursed arts by which a vile seducer gains the affections of a female; and the arts which a vile woman uses to conceal her wickedness. 21-23 Four sorts of persons are very troublesome. Men of low origin and base spirit, who, getting authority, become tyrants. Foolish and violent men indulging in excesses. A woman of a contentious spirit and vicious habits. A servant who has obtained undue influence.

At his advice, admonitions, and instructions; looks upon him with scorn and disdain, and treats him as a weak, silly, old man: here Agur returns to the first generation he had observed; <p>and despiseth to obey his mother; her orders and commands: or, "the obedience of his mother" (s); her discipline and instruction, having no regard to it. The word is rendered "gathering" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; and Jarchi interprets it of the gathering of wrinkles in her face: and so the Targum, Arabic, and Syriac versions render it, "the old age of his mother"; despising her as an old foolish woman; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-22.htm">Proverbs 23:22</a>;  in the Ethiopic language, signifies to "grow old", from whence the word here used, by a transposition of letters, may be derived; and Mr. Castell (t) observes, that the royal prophet, among others, seems to have taken this word from the queen of Sheba; <p>the ravens of the valley, shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it; it signifies, that such persons shall come to an untimely end, and an ignominious death; either be drowned in a river, when floating upon it, or cast upon the banks of it, the ravens that frequent such places, and are most cruel and voracious, should feed upon them: or they should be hanged on a tree, or be crucified (u), where birds of prey would light upon them; and particularly pick out their eyes and eat them, as being softest and sweetest to them; therefore first aim at them, and of which birds, and especially ravens, are very fond (w); and is a just retaliation for their scornful and disdainful looks at their parent. This may figuratively design the black devils of hell, the posse of them in the air, who are sometimes compared to the fowls thereof; to whom such unnatural and disobedient children shall become a prey; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-4.htm">Matthew 13:4</a>. <p>(s)  "obediantiam matris", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Cocceius, Michaelis; "doctrinam", Vatablus, Tigurine version; "disciplinam", Castalio; "obsequium matris", Schultens.

But etymology has led most modern commentators to give the sense of "obedience" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The ravens of the valley shall pick it out.</span> Such an undutiful son shall die a violent death; his corpse shall lie unburied, and the birds of prey shall feed upon him. It is well known that ravens, vultures, and other birds that live on carrion first attack the eyes of their prey; and in our own islands we are told crows and birds of this sort will fix on the eyes of young or sickly animals. Corn. a Lapide quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 108:5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Effossos oculos voret atro gutture corvus,<br />Intestina canes, cetera membra lupi."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"His eyes, plucked out, let croaking ravens gorge,<br />His bowels dogs, his limbs the greedy wolves."</span> The valley, or brook, reminds one of Elijah's miraculous support (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Young eagles.</span> The <span class="accented">nesher</span> must here mean one of the vulture tribe, as eagles do not feed on carrion (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-30.htm">Job 39:30</a>). St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 18:49) applies the proverb thus: "'The eye that sneereth at his father, and despiseth the travail of his mother, lo! the ravens from the torrents shall pick it out.' For bad men, while they find limit with the judgments of God, do 'sneer at their Father;' and heretics of all sorts, whilst in mocking they contemn the preaching of holy Church and her fruitfulness, what else is this but that they 'despise the travail of their mother'? whom we not unjustly call the mother of them as well, because from the same they come forth, who speak against the same." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follows a Priamel,<p>(Note: Cf. vol. i. p. 13. The name (from praeambulum) given to a peculiar form of popular gnomic poetry which prevailed in Germany from the 12th (e.g., the Meistersinger or Minstrel Sparvogel) to the 16th century, but was especially cultivated during the 14th and 15th centuries. Its peculiarity consisted in this, that after a series of antecedents or subjects, a briefly-expressed consequent or predicate was introduced as the epigrammatic point applicable to all these antecedents together. Vid., Erschenburg's Denkmlern altdeutscher Dichtkinst, Bremen 1799.)<p>the first line of which is, by &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;, connected with the &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500;&#1498; of the preceding distich:<p>11 A generation that curseth their father,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And doth not bless their mother;<p>12 A generation pure in their own eyes,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet not washed from their filthiness;<p>13 A generation - how haughty their eyes,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And their eyelids lift themselves up;<p>14 A generation whose teeth are swords and their jaw teeth knives<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To devour the poor from the earth and the needy from the midst of men.<p>Ewald translates: O generation! but that would have required the word, 13a, &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>), and one would have expected to have found something mentioned which the generation addressed were to take heed to; but it is not so. But if "O generation!" should be equivalent to "O regarding the generation!" then &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; ought to have introduced the sentence. And if we translate, with Luther: There is a generation, etc., then &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is supplied, which might drop out, but could not be omitted. The lxx inserts after &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; the word &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, and then renders what follows as pred. - a simple expedient, but worthless. The Venet. does not need this expedient, for it renders &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;; but then the order of the words in 11a would have been &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; &#1497;&#1511;&#1500;&#1500; &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;; and in 12a, after the manner of a subst. clause, &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; &#1496;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512; &#1489;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, one sees distinctly, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-13.htm">Proverbs 30:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>, that what follows &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; is to be understood, not as a pred., but as an attributive clause. As little can we interpret <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a>, with Lwenstein, as pred. of the three subj., "it is a generation whose teeth are swords;" that would at least have required the words &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-14.htm">Proverbs 30:14</a> is not at all a judgment valid for all the three subjects. The Targ. and Jerome translate correctly, as we above;<p>(Note: The Syr. begins 11a as if &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; were to be supplied.)<p>but by this rendering there are four subjects in the preamble, and the whole appears, since the common pred. is wanting, as a mutilated Priamel. Perhaps the author meant to say: it is such a generation that encompasses us; or: such is an abomination to Jahve; for &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; is a Gesamtheit  equals  totality, generation of men who are bound together by contemporary existence, or homogeneity, or by both, but always a totality; so that these <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11-14</a>, might describe quatuor detestabilia genera hominum (C. B. Michaelis), and yet one generatio, which divide among themselves these four vices, of blackest ingratitude, loathsome self-righteousness, arrogant presumption, and unmerciful covetousness. Similar is the description given in the Mishna Sota ix. 14, of the character of the age in which the Messiah appeared. "The appearance of this age," thus it concludes, "is like the appearance of a dog; a son is not ashamed before his father; to whom will we then look for help? To our Father in heaven!"<p>continued...</body></html>
