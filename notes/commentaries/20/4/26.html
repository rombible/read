It is not said, Keep at a due distance, but at a great distance; never think you can get far enough from it. The way of the righteous is light; Christ is their Way, and he is the Light. The saints will not be perfect till they reach heaven, but there they shall shine as the sun in his strength. The way of sin is as darkness. The way of the wicked is dark, therefore dangerous; they fall into sin, but know not how to avoid it. They fall into trouble, but never seek to know wherefore God contends with them, nor what will be in the end of it. This is the way we are bid to shun. Attentive hearing the word of God, is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart, and a good means of carrying it on. There is in the word of God a proper remedy for all diseases of the soul. Keep thy heart with all diligence. We must set a strict guard upon our souls; keep our hearts from doing hurt, and getting hurt. A good reason is given; because out of it are the issues of life. Above all, we should seek from the Lord Jesus that living water, the sanctifying Spirit, issuing forth unto everlasting life. Thus we shall be enabled to put away a froward mouth and perverse lips; our eyes will be turned from beholding vanity, looking straight forward, and walking by the rule of God's word, treading in the steps of our Lord and Master. Lord, forgive the past, and enable us to follow thee more closely for the time to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Speech turned from its true purpose, the wandering eye that leads on to evil, action hasty and inconsiderate, are the natural results where we do not "above all keeping keep our heart" <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26.

Consider well what path it is, whether right or wrong; or weigh it in the balances of thought, as Aben Ezra; or rather in the balances of the word, and see whether it agrees with that or not. The Septuagint version is, "make straight paths for thy feet"; to which the author of the epistle to the Hebrews seems to have respect, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-13.htm">Hebrews 12:13</a>; <p>and let all thy walls be established; so as to walk on steadily, constantly, uniformly, and not be easily moved out of the ways of religion and truth. Or, "let all thy ways be prepared", or "directed", or "disposed" (c); according to the rule of the divine word. Some render it as a promise, "and all thy ways shall be established" (d); when care is taken to look well into them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>. <p>(c) "dirigantur", Tigurine version, Mercerus; "recte apparentur aut disponantur", Vatablus.

Simplicity of aim in the moral life is to be accompanied by attention to the moral conduct. The sense is, remove every obstacle which may impede or render insecure the way of moral life, and thus avoid every false step. The meaning "to ponder," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to weigh," seems to be given to the verb <span class="accented">palles</span>, piel of the unused <span class="accented">palas</span> here used only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a> and possibly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a>. Its ordinary signification is "to make level, or even," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-7.htm">Isaiah 26:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6</a>. The LXX. keeps this in view in rendering, "Make straight paths for thy feet" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-13.htm">Hebrews 12:13</a>). The Authorized Version would mean, "Weigh your conduct as in a balance; before acting, consider the consequences and nature of the act." The second clause, <span class="cmt_word">and let all thy ways be established,</span> is in effect only a repetition of the preceding thought, since it signifies, "See that thy conduct is correct; let all thy ways be definite and fixed." The marginal reading. "And all thy ways shall be ordered aright." gives the literal rendering to the tense; <span class="accented">yikkonu</span> being the future hiph. of <span class="accented">kun</span>, "to be established," "to stand firm." This would express the <span class="accented">result</span> of giving heed to one's conduct. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The paternal admonition now takes a new departure:<p>20 My son, attend unto my words,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incline thine ear to my sayings.<p>21 Let them not depart from thine eyes;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep them in the midst of thine heart.<p>22 For they are life to all who get possession of them,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And health to their whole body.<p>Regarding the Hiph. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; (for &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;), <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-21.htm">Proverbs 4:21</a>, formed after the Chaldee manner like &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;, &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1497;&#1490;, vid., Gesenius, 72, 9; - Ewald, 114, c, gives to it the meaning of "to mock," for he interchanges it with &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;, instead of the meaning to take away, efficere ut recedat (cf. under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>). This supposed causative meaning it has also here: may they  equals  may one (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-22.htm">Proverbs 2:22</a>) not remove them from thine eyes; the object is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20</a>) the words of the paternal admonition. Hitzig, indeed, observes that "the accusative is not supplied;" but with greater right it is to be remarked that &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; (fut. Hiph. of &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;) and &#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; (fut. Kal of id.) are not one and the same, and the less so as &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494; occurs, but the masoretical and grammatical authorities (e.g., Kimchi) demand &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;. The plur. &#1500;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; is continued, 22b, in the sing., for that which is said refers to each one of the many (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>). &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; is fundamentally an active conception, like our "finden," to find; it means to attain, to produce, to procure, etc. &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488; means, according as the &#1502; is understood of the "that  equals  ut" of the action or of the "what" of its performance, either health or the means of health; here, like &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a>, not with the underlying conception of sickness, but of the fluctuations connected with the bodily life of man, which make needful not only a continual strengthening of it, but also its being again and again restored. Nothing preserves soul and body in a healthier state than when we always keep before our eyes and carry in our hearts the good doctrines; they give to us true guidance on the way of life: "Godliness has the promise of this life, and of that which is to come." <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>. </body></html>
