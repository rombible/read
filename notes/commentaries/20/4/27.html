It is not said, Keep at a due distance, but at a great distance; never think you can get far enough from it. The way of the righteous is light; Christ is their Way, and he is the Light. The saints will not be perfect till they reach heaven, but there they shall shine as the sun in his strength. The way of sin is as darkness. The way of the wicked is dark, therefore dangerous; they fall into sin, but know not how to avoid it. They fall into trouble, but never seek to know wherefore God contends with them, nor what will be in the end of it. This is the way we are bid to shun. Attentive hearing the word of God, is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart, and a good means of carrying it on. There is in the word of God a proper remedy for all diseases of the soul. Keep thy heart with all diligence. We must set a strict guard upon our souls; keep our hearts from doing hurt, and getting hurt. A good reason is given; because out of it are the issues of life. Above all, we should seek from the Lord Jesus that living water, the sanctifying Spirit, issuing forth unto everlasting life. Thus we shall be enabled to put away a froward mouth and perverse lips; our eyes will be turned from beholding vanity, looking straight forward, and walking by the rule of God's word, treading in the steps of our Lord and Master. Lord, forgive the past, and enable us to follow thee more closely for the time to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The ever-recurring image of the straight road on which no one ever loses his way represents here as elsewhere the onward course through life of the man who seeks and finds wisdom. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27.

Either into the road of immorality and profaneness, or into that of error, superstition, and false worship; but attend to the way of holiness and truth, directed to in the word of God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>; nor be moved out of it by threatenings and menaces, nor by flatteries and promises; neither be cast down with adversity, nor be lifted up with prosperity; but keep on in an even way, attending to that which is just and right; leaving all events with God, as knowing you are in the way of your duty, and in which he would have you walk; <p>remove, by foot from evil; from walking in evil ways and along with evil men, and from doing evil things; abstain from all appearance of evil, keep at a distance from it; the evil of sin brings on the evil of punishment.

The command is the parallel of ver. 25. As in ver. 25, the gaze is to be concentrated. So here the feet are not to deflect nor turn aside to byways. Nothing is to be permitted to draw one off from the right way, neither adversity, nor prosperity, nor anything which can possess the power of temptation (Bayne and Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">Remove thy foot from evil.</span> A fuller expression than "depart from evil," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-7.htm">Proverbs 3:7</a>.

This supposed causative meaning it has also here: may they  equals  may one (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-22.htm">Proverbs 2:22</a>) not remove them from thine eyes; the object is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-20.htm">Proverbs 4:20</a>) the words of the paternal admonition. Hitzig, indeed, observes that "the accusative is not supplied;" but with greater right it is to be remarked that &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; (fut. Hiph. of &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;) and &#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; (fut. Kal of id.) are not one and the same, and the less so as &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494; occurs, but the masoretical and grammatical authorities (e.g., Kimchi) demand &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;. The plur. &#1500;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; is continued, 22b, in the sing., for that which is said refers to each one of the many (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>). &#1502;&#1510;&#1488; is fundamentally an active conception, like our "finden," to find; it means to attain, to produce, to procure, etc. &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488; means, according as the &#1502; is understood of the "that  equals  ut" of the action or of the "what" of its performance, either health or the means of health; here, like &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a>, not with the underlying conception of sickness, but of the fluctuations connected with the bodily life of man, which make needful not only a continual strengthening of it, but also its being again and again restored. Nothing preserves soul and body in a healthier state than when we always keep before our eyes and carry in our hearts the good doctrines; they give to us true guidance on the way of life: "Godliness has the promise of this life, and of that which is to come." <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>. </body></html>
