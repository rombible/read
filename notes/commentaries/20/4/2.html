Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Doctrine - Knowledge orally given and received. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>Pr 4:1-27.

He who does "violence to the law" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-4.htm">Zephaniah 3:4</a>) becomes thereby, according to the common course of the world, a person who is feared, whose authority, power, and resources are increased, but one must not therefore envy him, nor on any side take pleasure in his conduct, which in all respects is to be reprobated; for the &#1504;&#1500;&#1493;&#1494;, inflexus, tortuosus (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>), who swerves from the right way and goes in a crooked false way, is an object of Jahve's abhorrence, while, on the contrary, the just, who with a right mind walks in the right way, is Jahve's &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; - an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>. &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; (R. &#1505;&#1491;, to be firm, compressed) means properly the being pressed together, or sitting together (cf. the Arab. wisa&#770;d, wisa&#770;dt, a cushion, divan, corresponding in form to the Hebr. &#1497;&#1505;&#1493;&#1491;) for the purpose of private communication and conversation (&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1491;), and then partly the confidential intercourse, as here (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-4.htm">Job 29:4</a>), partly the private communication, the secret (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). lxx, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; [&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;] &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;. Those who are out of the way, who prefer to the simplicity of right-doing all manner of crooked ways, are contrary to God, and He may have nothing to do with them; but the right-minded He makes partakers of His most intimate intercourse, He deals with them as His friends. </body></html>
