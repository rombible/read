Then it came to mean “beloved as an only son,” and that appears to be the sense of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm" title="And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.">Genesis 22:2</a>, as applied to Isaac (for Ishmael was then living), and to Solomon here (for Bath-sheba had other children by David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:">1Chronicles 3:5</a>).

Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life.

The part taken by Bathsheba in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1</a>, no less than the friendship between her and Nathan, indicates that a mother's training might well have laid the foundation of the king's future wisdom.

Or, "a son to my father" (p); so Solomon was to God, his heavenly Father, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>; which Jarchi observes, and gives as the sense of this place: but his father David is meant, whose son he was; though he was not his only one, he had others besides him. But the sense is, that he was his darling, his beloved son, whom he loved above the rest; as he was beloved of the Lord, and therefore his name was called Jedidiah, so he was beloved of his father; and, because he had a peculiar love for him, he took a particular care of his education; <p>tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother; his mother Bathsheba, who had a most affectionate regard to him; and therefore in his tender age, as soon as he was susceptible of instructions, gave them to him, which being received, made deep and lasting impressions on him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>. The marginal reading is, "to the sons of my mother"; for Bathsheba had more sons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>; both readings may be retained, "beloved in the sight of my mother's sons". Gersom interprets this of the people of Israel, who were sons to God their Father; and were the only nation that received the law, and which they received at the time of their coming out of Egypt, in the days of their youth. <p>(p)   "filius fui patri meo", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus, Gejerus, Michaelis; so Cocceius, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">my father’s son</span>] The order of the words in the original: <span class="bld">a son was I to my father</span>, suggests the meaning, I was a <span class="ital">true</span> son, a son not only by birth, but by filial reverence and obedience, “<span class="ital">filius</span>, i.e. cum vi; veri nominis filius.” Maur.

The point is interesting as bearing upon the authorship of this part of the Book. Solomon was not an “only” son, though it might reasonably be urged that he was so in the same sense as was Isaac, of whom this same word is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm" title="And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.">Genesis 22:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm" title="And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:">Genesis 22:16</a>.

Comp. “Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-1.htm" title="Furthermore David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>, where (see preceding note), the word “tender” is also applied as here to Solomon. But Solomon was from his birth specially beloved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/12-24.htm" title="And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him....">2 Samuel 12:24-25</a>), and the word is used elsewhere in this derived sense, “alone” not only in fact, but in the value set upon it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm" title="Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.">Psalm 22:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-17.htm" title="Lord, how long will you look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.">Psalm 35:17</a>, “my darling”; where see notes in this Series). <span class="greekheb">ἀγαπώμενος</span>, LXX.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I was my father's son.</span> This is more than the mere statement of a physical fact. It indicates that the teacher was in the highest degree an object of endearment to his father, just as he states in the second hemistich that he held a unique position in the affection of his mother. `The statement agrees with the historical record. Solomon would be more than ordinarily dear to his father, as being a child of promise, as "the beloved of the Lord," and as the son whom the Divine will had pointed as the successor to his throne, and the one on whom was to devolve the building of the temple (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>). Bertheau explains, "I also once stood in the relation to my (actual) father in which you stand to me your paternal instructor," thus giving prominence rather to the consecution of the passage, and preparing the way for the reception of the father's advice which is to follow. But this rather loses sight of what appears an important element in the instruction, that not only was it "good," but that it was dictated by affection. The writer is fortifying and strengthening his instruction by the authority of his father, showing that what he was laying before others he had had placed before him; and  as <span class="accented">his</span> father's advice was the outcome of affection, so he addresses his hearers in the same spirit. Dathe and others connect "tender" <span class="accented">rak</span>) with "son" (<span class="accented">ben</span>), and render, "I was a son dear to my father." So the LXX., which, however, understands "tender" in the sense of "tractable," "obedient:" "For I was an obedient son to my father" - a meaning which the word <span class="accented">rak</span> can only bear as indicating the susceptibility of the young to receive impressions. In general, <span class="accented">rak</span> means "tender," "soft," and has reference to the weakness and helplessness of the young; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-13.htm">Genesis 33:13</a>, "My lord knoweth that the children are tender (<span class="accented">rakkim</span>)." Combined with <span class="accented">yakhid</span>, which follows, it signifies, in the passage before us, that the teacher was an object of tender care or love. The Vulgate <span class="accented">tenellus</span>, the diminutive of <span class="accented">tener</span>, as signifying "somewhat tender or delicate," reproduces the idea of the Hebrew <span class="accented">rak.</span> In the word the teacher recalls his early lifo and the instruction in wisdom which he received in it. <span class="cmt_word">Only beloved;</span> literally, <span class="accented">only</span> (<span class="accented">yakhid</span>), as "beloved" does not occur in the original. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">unigenitus</span>; Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "only begotten:" but this was not literally the fact, as Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon, had other sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>). Both the Hebrew <span class="accented">yakhid</span>, "only," and the Vulgate <span class="accented">unigenitus</span>, "only begotten," consequently signify what is expressed by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "beloved." Solomon was so beloved of his mother as if he were an only child. So <span class="accented">yakhid</span> is used of Isaac in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2, 12</a> in the same way, since at the time that Isaac was so designated, Ishmael, the other son of Abraham, was still living. The word <span class="accented">yakhid</span> occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a>, where it is rendered "darling," and may possibly refer to Solomon. Jennings, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a>, understands it, however, of the life besides which the psalmist has no other - <span class="accented">unicam meam, as</span> the Vulgate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "his only life" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-17.htm">Psalm 35:17</a>; and for the word <span class="accented">yakhid</span>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-26.htm">Jeremiah 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of my mother</span> (<span class="accented">liph'ne immi</span>); literally, <span class="accented">ad facies matris meae</span>, or, <span class="accented">before my mother</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">coram matre mea, i.e.</span> in her estimation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-18.htm">Genesis 17:18</a>). The mention of the mother is probably introduced here for the sake of poetic parallelism; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a> (Zockler). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These exhortations to neighbourly love in the form of warning against whatever is opposed to it, are followed by the warning against fellowship with the loveless:<p>31 Be not envious toward the man of violence,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And have no pleasure in all his ways.<p>32 For an abhorrence to Jahve is the perverse,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But with the upight is His secret.<p>The conceptions of jealousy and envy lie in &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; (derived by Schultens from &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;, Arab. k&#803;ana&#770;, intensius rubere) inseparable from each other.

There is no reason for correcting our text in accordance with this (substituting &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1512; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; as Hitzig does), because &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; would be too vague an expression for the object of the envy, while &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; altogether agrees with it; and the contrary remark, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; is fundamentally no &#1489;&#1495;&#1512;, fails since (1) &#1489;&#1495;&#1512; frequently expresses pleasure in anything without the idea of choice, and (2) "have not pleasure in all his ways" is in the Hebrew style equivalent to "in any one of his ways;" Ewald, 323b.
