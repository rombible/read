It is not said, Keep at a due distance, but at a great distance; never think you can get far enough from it. The way of the righteous is light; Christ is their Way, and he is the Light. The saints will not be perfect till they reach heaven, but there they shall shine as the sun in his strength. The way of sin is as darkness. The way of the wicked is dark, therefore dangerous; they fall into sin, but know not how to avoid it. They fall into trouble, but never seek to know wherefore God contends with them, nor what will be in the end of it. This is the way we are bid to shun. Attentive hearing the word of God, is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart, and a good means of carrying it on. There is in the word of God a proper remedy for all diseases of the soul. Keep thy heart with all diligence. We must set a strict guard upon our souls; keep our hearts from doing hurt, and getting hurt. A good reason is given; because out of it are the issues of life. Above all, we should seek from the Lord Jesus that living water, the sanctifying Spirit, issuing forth unto everlasting life. Thus we shall be enabled to put away a froward mouth and perverse lips; our eyes will be turned from beholding vanity, looking straight forward, and walking by the rule of God's word, treading in the steps of our Lord and Master. Lord, forgive the past, and enable us to follow thee more closely for the time to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Speech turned from its true purpose, the wandering eye that leads on to evil, action hasty and inconsiderate, are the natural results where we do not "above all keeping keep our heart" <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

As a noun, the word <span class="accented">nokakh</span>, rendered "right  on," signifies what is straight in front of one; adverbially, it has the same meaning as that given in the Authorized Version. The corresponding "before" (<span class="accented">neged</span>) is substantively the side of any object which is opposite one, and as a preposition is equivalent to "before," "in the presence of," like the Latin <span class="accented">coram.</span> The versions (LXX., Syriac, Targum) take <span class="accented">nokakh</span> in the sense of "right things:" "Let thine eyes look at right things;" contemplate them, aim at justice and equity. This meaning is given to the cognate adjective <span class="accented">nakoakh</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-9.htm">Proverbs 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-26.htm">Proverbs 24:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-14.htm">Isaiah 59:14</a>; but in the Proverbs the word <span class="accented">nokakh</span> only occurs twice (here and ver. 21), either as an adverb, "right on," "straightforwardly," or as a preposition, "before." <span class="accented">Look straight.</span> Gesenius takes this verb <span class="accented">yashar</span> in hiph., "to make straight," as used elliptically: "Let thine eyelids <span class="accented">direct</span> a way before thee;" but the meaning is the same as "Let them look straight before thee." The Syriac, Gejerus, and Holden render, "Let thine eyelids direct thy way before thee;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do nothing rashly, but everything with premeditation; examine thy conduct, and see that it is right. The verb <span class="accented">yashar</span> has this meaning, "to direct," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>, but it is here used intransitively (Mercerus). <span class="accented">Eyelids</span> (<span class="accented">aph'appim</span>); so called from their fluttering, rapid motion, here used by way of poetic parallelism with "eyes." What the command inculcates is simplicity of aim or principle, singleness of motive. The moral gaze is to be steadily fixed, because if it wanders indolently, lasciviously, aimlessly, it imperils the purity of the soul. This verse may be understood, as Zockler, as containing a command levelled against dishonest practices. The man who intends to cheat his neighbour looks this way and that how he may deceive him. Such an interpretation may be maintained on the ground that the former verse is directed against falsehood in <span class="accented">speech</span>; this against falsehood in <span class="accented">action.</span> But the former view is preferable. If you wish to keep the heart, you must be guided by simplicity of aim; look not aside either to the one hand or to the other, lest you may be led astray by the seductions and temptations which imperil the onward and upward progress of the soul. The passage reminds us of the "single eye" (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>), "simple," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> intent on heaven and God, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The two ways that lie for his choice before the youth, are distinguished from one another as light is from darkness:<p>18 And the path of the just is like the brightness of the morning light,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which shines more and more till the perfect day.<p>19 The way of the wicked is deep darkness,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They know not at what they stumble.<p>The Hebr. style is wont to conceal in its Vav (&#1493;) diverse kinds of logical relations, but the Vav of 18a may suitably stand before 19a, where the discontinuance of this contrast of the two ways is unsuitable. The displacing of a Vav from its right position is not indeed without example (see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-3.htm">Psalm 16:3</a>); but since <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a> joins itself more easily than <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-17.htm">Proverbs 4:17</a> without missing a particle, thus it is more probable that the two verses are to be transposed, than that the &#1493; of &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1495; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-17.htm">Proverbs 4:17</a>) is to be prefixed to &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a>). Sinning, says <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a>, has become to the godless as a second nature, so that they cannot sleep without it; they must continually be sinning, adds <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-17.htm">Proverbs 4:17</a>, for thus and not otherwise do they gain for themselves their daily bread. With reference to this fearful self-perversion to which wickedness has become a necessity and a condition of life, the poet further says that the way of the godless is &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;,<p>(Note: In good MSS and printed copies the &#1499; has the Pathach, as Kimchi states the rule in Michlol 45a: &#1499;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; &#1508;&#1514;&#1495;, &#1499;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1514;&#1495;.)<p>as deep darkness, as the entire absence of light: it cannot be otherwise than that they fall, but they do not at all know whereat they fall, for they do not at all know wickedness as such, and have no apprehension of the punishment which from an inward necessity it brings along with it; on the contrary, the path of the just is in constantly increasing light - the light of knowledge, and the light of true happiness which is given<p>(Note: Hitzig inverts the order of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm">Proverbs 4:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a>, and connects the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; of 16a immediately with <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a> (for the way of the wicked...). He moreover regards <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-17.htm">Proverbs 4:17</a> as an interpolation, and explains <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a> as a gloss transforming the text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a>. "That the wicked commit wickedness," says Hitzig, "is indeed certain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a>), and the warning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-15.htm">Proverbs 4:15</a> ought not to derive its motive from their energy in sinning." But the warning against the way of the wicked is founded not on their energy in sinning, but on their bondage to sin: their sleep, their food and drink - their life both when they sleep and when they wake - is conditioned by sin and is penetrated by sin. This foundation of the warning furnishes what is needed, and is in nothing open to objection. And that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a> &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1497;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1504;&#1490;&#1494;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492; seem to be alike, does not prove that <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a> originated as a parallel text from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a> - in the one verse as in the other the thoughts are original.)<p>in and with knowledge.

The light of this morning sunshine is &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, going and shining, i.e., becoming ever brighter. In the connection of &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; it might be a question whether &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; is regarded as gerundive (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/8-3.htm">Genesis 8:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-5.htm">Genesis 8:5</a>), or as participle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-6.htm">Jeremiah 41:6</a>), or as a participial adjective (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-13.htm">Genesis 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-24.htm">Judges 4:24</a>); in the connection of &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1498; &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, on the contrary, it is unquestionably the gerundive: the partic. denoting the progress joins itself either with the partic., <a href="http://biblehub.com/jonah/1-11.htm">Jonah 1:11</a>, or with the participial adjective, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>, or with another adjective formation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-4.htm">Esther 9:4</a> (where &#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1493;&#1500; after &#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1500; of other places appears to be intended as an adjective, not after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-10.htm">2 Samuel 5:10</a> as gerundive). Thus &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512;, as also &#1493;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>, will be participial after the form &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, being ashamed (Ges. 72, 1); cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-5.htm">Zechariah 10:5</a>, &#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>. "&#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; quite corresponds to the Greek &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; (as one also says &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), and to the Arabic qa&#770;'mt &#8219;l-nha&#770;r and qa&#770;'mt &#8219;l-dhyrt. The figure is probably derived from the balance (cf. Lucan's Pharsalia, lib. 9: quam cardine summo Stat librata dies): before and after midday the tongue on the balance of the day bends to the left and to the right, but at the point of midday it stands directly in the midst" (Fleischer). It is the midday time that is meant, when the clearness of the day has reached its fullest intensity - the point between increasing and decreasing, when, as we are wont to say, the sun stands in the zenith ( equals  Arab. samt, the point of support, i.e., the vertex). Besides <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-28.htm">Mark 4:28</a>, there is no biblical passage which presents like these two a figure of gradual development. The progress of blissful knowledge is compared to that of the clearness of the day till it reaches its midday height, having reached to which it becomes a knowing of all in God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-5.htm">Proverbs 28:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>. </body></html>
