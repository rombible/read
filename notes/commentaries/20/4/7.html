Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or, "The beginning of wisdom is - get wisdom."

Or principal, one; the principal of persons and things; the principal of persons, angels or men: Christ is superior to angels, having a more excellent name and nature than they; he is the God, the Creator, and head of them, and is above them in the human nature; he is superior to men, to the greatest of men, he is King of kings and Lord of lords, and to the best of men the saints. Are they kings? he is their King: are they priests? he is the great High Priest: are any of them prophets, teachers, shepherds? he is the great Prophet in Israel; a Teacher, that never any taught or spoke like him; the chief Shepherd and Bishop of souls: is the church a family? he is the Master of it: is it a body? he is the Head: is it a building? he is the Foundation and Corner Stone; yea, the chief Master Builder. He is the beginning and chief of all God's ways, and the chief in them; in election, in the council of peace, and covenant of grace; in redemption and salvation, in grace and glory; he is all in all. Or the words may be rendered, "Wisdom is the beginning" (q); so Christ is called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; a phrase expressive of his eternity, and of his being the first cause and author of all things, both in the old and new creation. Or thus, that which is "the beginning of wisdom get" (r), &amp;c. which is the fear of the Lord; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <p>therefore get wisdom; not an interest in Christ, but a knowledge of it; and make use of all means to obtain a greater knowledge of him, and of interest in him, which is what the apostle calls "winning" Christ; by which he means, not getting an interest in him, that he had already, but gaining a greater degree of knowledge of him, as the context shows, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>; or, "buy wisdom" (s); that is, without money and without price; so Christ advises to buy gold and white raiment of him, his grace and righteousness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>; <p>and with all thy getting get understanding; another name for Christ; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-14.htm">Proverbs 8:14</a>; Or, "along with all thy getting" (t), or "above all"; let not Christ be wanting; he is the one thing needful, the good and better part and portion, which, if missing, all other substance signifies little: or part with all for this pearl of great price, Wisdom, and prefer it to all worldly substance; look upon all but dross in comparison of Christ and the knowledge of him: all other gettings or substance are only for the body, this for the soul, and the eternal welfare of it; they are only for a time, this for eternity; they are not satisfying, but, having this, a soul has enough, has all things; Christ being his, all things are his; he possesses all things, and all other things are not blessings without him. <p>(q)  "principium sapientiae", Montanus, Mercerus, Gejerus.

(the verse is omitted by the Vatican LXX.), Targum, and Syriac, agree in rendering this verse, "The beginning of wisdom is get wisdom," which is equivalent to saying that the beginning of wisdom consists in the acquisition of wisdom, or, as Umbreit explains, "in the resolution to get wisdom." That this rendering, which is adopted by Luther, Delitzsch, and Umbreit, may be correct appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> and Proverbs 9:10, where we have the same construction, only in inverted order. Seneca's aphorism is conceived in much the same spirit: "Magna pars boni est velle fieri bonum" - "A large part of good is the wish to become good;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the beginning of being good depends to a large extent upon the wish to become so. The objections to this rendering are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That it is difficult to see how the beginning of wisdom can be the acquisition of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That elsewhere, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> and Proverbs 9:10, the beginning of wisdom is represented as the fear of the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That it does not fall in well with the context or with the aim of the father's teaching, which is to hold up wisdom as pre-eminently a blessing, as the most excellent and highest thing attainable. On the other hand, Hitzig, De Dieu, Doderlein, Zockler, render as in the Authorized Version, "Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wisdom is the highest good, and therefore ought to be obtained. The word <span class="accented">reshith</span> is found with this signification in ch. 24:20; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-29.htm">1 Samuel 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-19.htm">Job 40:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-35.htm">Jeremiah 49:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1-6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And with all thy getting get understanding</span>. This does not mean, as the Authorized Version seems to imply, that while you are acquiring other things, you are to acquire wisdom, but that wisdom is to be purchased with all you have acquired or gotten. "Getting" (<span class="accented">kin'yon</span>) is the purchase money. No price is too high to be paid for her, no sacrifice too great; cf. the parables of the hidden treasure and goodly pearl (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-44.htm">Matthew 13:44</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-42.htm">Luke 10:42</a>), in both of which the man sold "all that he had" to obtain the prize. There is a play upon the words in the original (<span class="accented">kin'yan'ki k'neh</span>), which is preserved in our translation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He now confirms and explains the command to duty which he has placed at the beginning of the whole (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>). This he does by his own example, for he relates from the history of his own youth, to the circle of disciples by whom he sees himself surrounded, what good doctrine his parents had taught him regarding the way of life:<p>1 Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And attend that ye may gain understanding;<p>2 For I give to you good doctrine,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Forsake not my direction!<p>3 For I was a son to my father,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A tender and only (son) in the sight of my mother.<p>4 And he instructed me, and said to me:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let thine heart hold fast my words:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Observe my commandments and live!"<p>That &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; in the address comes here into the place of &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, hitherto used, externally denotes that &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; in the progress of these discourses finds another application: the poet himself is so addressed by his father. Intentionally he does not say &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>): he does not mean the father of each individual among those addressed, but himself, who is a father in his relation to them as his disciples; and as he manifests towards them fatherly love, so also he can lay claim to paternal authority over them. &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; is rightly vocalized, not &#1500;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;. The words do not give the object of attention, but the design, the aim. The combination of ideas in &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>), which appears to us singular, loses its strangeness when we remember that &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; means, according to its etymon, deposition or reception into the conscience and life. Regarding &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;, apprehension, reception, lesson  equals  doctrine, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>. &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is the perf., which denotes as fixed and finished what is just now being done, Gesenius, 126, 4. &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; is here synonym of &#1504;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, and the contrary of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-4.htm">Proverbs 28:4</a>.

Superficially understood, the expression 3a would be a platitude; the author means that the natural legal relation was also confirming itself as a moral one.
