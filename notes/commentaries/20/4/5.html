Solomon's parents loved him, therefore taught him. Wise and godly men, in every age of the world, and rank in society, agree that true wisdom consists in obedience, and is united to happiness. Get wisdom, take pains for it. Get the rule over thy corruptions; take more pains to get this than the wealth of this world. An interest in Christ's salvation is necessary. This wisdom is the one thing needful. A soul without true wisdom and grace is a dead soul. How poor, contemptible, and wretched are those, who, with all their wealth and power, die without getting understanding, without Christ, without hope, and without God! Let us give heed to the sayings of Him who has the words of eternal life. Thus our path will be plain before us: by taking, and keeping fast hold of instruction, we shall avoid being straitened or stumbling.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The counsel which has come to him, in substance, from his father.

Not only moral and political wisdom and understanding, but that which is spiritual and evangelical; Christ, and the knowledge of him; he being the only happy man that has an interest in him, and is possessed of him by faith, which is the meaning of getting him; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13</a>; by which it appears, that what Solomon had before delivered, and afterwards repeats and urges, was the same his father David, that wise, great, and good man, taught him; and which he mentions, the more to recommend the getting of wisdom and understanding to others; <p>forget it not; when gotten, keep it in remembrance; be continually meditating on Wisdom, or Christ, his glories and excellencies; the fulness of grace and truth in him; the blessings of goodness which come by him; the great use and profit of having and enjoying him; <p>neither decline from the words of my mouth; the above instructions, and all others he gave unto him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - After the general exhortation given above, the father's instruction becomes more specific, and deals with the acquirement of wisdom. This subject seems to be continued in ver. 13, where the second and concluding branch of the instruction begins, which consists mainly of warning, as the first part does with exhortation. We are thus furnished with an example how to teach. In our teaching it is not sufficient simply to point out what is to be done, but we must show what is to be avoided. <span class="cmt_word">Get wisdom, get understanding</span>. The father urges the acquirement of wisdom in the same way and with the same importunity as the trader or merchant presses his goods upon buyers. Wisdom and understanding are put forward as objects of merchandise; for the verb <span class="accented">kanah</span>, from which the imperative <span class="accented">k'neh</span>, signifies not only "to acquire for one's self," or "to possess," but especially "to buy." The verb occurs again in the same sense in ver. 7, "Get [<span class="accented">k'neh, i.e.</span> buy] wisdom;" and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-23.htm">Proverbs 23:23</a>, "Buy (<span class="accented">k'neh</span>) the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding" (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>: 16:16; 19:9, where we also meet with the same verb). The reiteration of the word "get," as Umbreit remarks, is "an imitation of the exclamation of a merchant who is offering his wares." The importunity of the father measures the value he sets upon wisdom as an inestimable treasure, a pearl of great price (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Forget it not,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">forget not, neither turn from the words of my mouth</span>, - so Zockler, Delitzsch, Hodg., and others; Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne obliviscaris, neque declines a verbis oris mei.</span> There is no  need to supply "it" after the verb <span class="accented">al-tish'-kakh</span>, "forget not," as Holden states, and as appears in the Authorized Version, since <span class="accented">shakakh is</span> found with <span class="accented">min</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>), "of" or "from," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-4.htm">Psalm 12:4</a> (5), "I forgot to eat (<span class="accented">shakakh'ti meakol</span>)," and the same construction may obtain here. The two verbs, "forget" and "decline from," are not so very wide in meaning, since the former, <span class="accented">shakakh</span>, is to "leave" something from forgetfulness, and the latter, <span class="accented">natah</span>, rendered here "decline from," is "to turn away" from something. <span class="cmt_word">The words of my mouth</span> represent as it were the means by which wisdom may be purchased. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>His relation to men is determined by their relation to Him.<p>As for the scorners, He scorneth them,<p>But to the lowly He giveth grace.<p>Most interpreters render the verse thus: "If the scorner He (even He, in return) scorneth, so He (on the other hand) giveth grace to the lowly." For the sequence of the words in the consequence, in which the precedence of the verb is usual, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-5.htm">Leviticus 12:5</a>, we are referred to <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-18.htm">Proverbs 23:18</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-14.htm">Proverbs 24:14</a>; but why had the poet placed the two facts in the relation of condition and consequence? The one fact is not the consequence but the reverse of the other, and accordingly they are opposed to each other in coordinated passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>. The Vav in such antitheses has generally the meaning of "and on the other hand," e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/8-20.htm">Job 8:20</a>, while the lxx, Targ., Syriac, and Jerome altogether pass over the &#1488;&#1501; as if it did not exist. Ziegler translates: "Truly! the scorner He scorneth;" but an affirmative &#1488;&#1501; does not exist, the asseveration after the manner of an oath is negative. Bertheau's expedient would be more acceptable, by which he makes the whole of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a> the protasis to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>; but if this were intended, another subject would not enter into <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>. Thus 34a and 34b are two independent parallel passages; &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1500;&#1500;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; is the protasis: if as regards the scorners, i.e., if His conduct is directed to the scorners, so He scorneth. The &#1500; denotes relation, and in this elliptical usage is like the &#1500; of superscription, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-9.htm">Jeremiah 23:9</a>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is the emphatic &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;: He on the contrary, and in a decisive way (Ewald, 314ab). Instead of &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509; fo  there might have been used &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1510;&#1501; (for &#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509;, where it occurs as a governing word, has the accusative, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-28.htm">Proverbs 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-51.htm">Psalm 119:51</a>), but we do not miss the object: if it relates to scorners (thus also Lwenstein translates), so it is He in return who scorneth. The lxx renders it: &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is used as a name of God (Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitschr. xvi. 400), on which account it is rendered like &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; by &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. A &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (appearing above others, i.e., overbearing) is the &#1500;&#1509;, according to the definition <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-24.htm">Proverbs 21:24</a>. the expression of the talio is generalized in &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (resists them). For &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; the Ker&#305;&#770; has &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;: &#1506;&#1504;&#1493; (from &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, the ground-form &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;, Arab. 'anaw) is the lowly (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), or he who bends himself, i.e., the gentle and humble, the patient, and the passive &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;, he who is bowed down, the suffering; but the limits of the conception are moveable, since in &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; is presupposed the possession of fruit-virtues gained in the school of affliction. </body></html>
