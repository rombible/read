It is not said, Keep at a due distance, but at a great distance; never think you can get far enough from it. The way of the righteous is light; Christ is their Way, and he is the Light. The saints will not be perfect till they reach heaven, but there they shall shine as the sun in his strength. The way of sin is as darkness. The way of the wicked is dark, therefore dangerous; they fall into sin, but know not how to avoid it. They fall into trouble, but never seek to know wherefore God contends with them, nor what will be in the end of it. This is the way we are bid to shun. Attentive hearing the word of God, is a good sign of a work of grace begun in the heart, and a good means of carrying it on. There is in the word of God a proper remedy for all diseases of the soul. Keep thy heart with all diligence. We must set a strict guard upon our souls; keep our hearts from doing hurt, and getting hurt. A good reason is given; because out of it are the issues of life. Above all, we should seek from the Lord Jesus that living water, the sanctifying Spirit, issuing forth unto everlasting life. Thus we shall be enabled to put away a froward mouth and perverse lips; our eyes will be turned from beholding vanity, looking straight forward, and walking by the rule of God's word, treading in the steps of our Lord and Master. Lord, forgive the past, and enable us to follow thee more closely for the time to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>i. e., Bread and wine gained by unjust deeds.

The reason is found in the character of sinners, whose zeal to do evil is forcibly depicted (Pr 6:4; Ps 36:5). They live by flagrant vices (Pr 1:13). Some prefer to render, "Their bread is wickedness, their drink violence" (compare Job 15:16; 34:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They eat the bread of wickedness:</span> the sense is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Either that is gotten by wicked and unlawful means, or wickedness itself is bread unto them; it is that to their minds as bread is to their bodies; they feed upon it with as much eagerness, appetite, gust, and pleasure; it is a sweet morsel to them; it is meat, drink, sleep, and everything to them; they take the highest satisfaction and the utmost delight in it; <p>and drink the wine of violence: either that which is obtained by rapine and violence; or they as greedily commit such acts of oppression and injury as a man drinks a glass of wine; they do not drink up iniquity like water only, but even like wine, the most generous and delicious.

This verse may be taken either (1) literally, they procure their bread and wine, get their living, by wickedness and violence, or (2) figuratively, wickedness and violence are to them as meat and drink.

It serves not so much to introduce another independent statement, as one which accounts for the statement made in the preceding verse, that the wicked sleep not unless they have done mischief, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it states the reason why they are so conditioned. There is no comparison expressed in the original, as the rendering adopted by Schultens and others implies, "For wickedness do they eat as bread, and violence do they drink as wine," which is evidently based on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>, "Which drinketh up iniquity like water," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-7.htm">Job 34:7</a>, "Who drinketh up scorning like water." The literal rendering is, <span class="accented">for they eat the bread of wickedness, and the wine of violence do they drink. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The bread of wickedness</span> (<span class="accented">lekhem resha</span>) is not bread which consists in wickedness, but bread which is obtained by wickedness, just as the wine of violence (<span class="accented">yiyin khamasim</span>) is not the wine which produces violence, but the wine that is procured by violent dee,is. Their support, what they eat and drink, is obtained by wickedness and injustice. They live by wrong. For such expressions as "the bread of wickedness" and "the wine of violence," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>, "the bread of affliction;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>, "the bread of sorrows;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-8.htm">Amos 2:8</a>, "the wine of the condemned." There is a charade of tense in the verbs, the first being perfect, "they have eaten," and the second future, "they shall drink," which Delitzsch explains as representing the twofold act - first eating the bread, and then washing it down with wine. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There is no reason for the supposition that the warning which his father gave to the poet now passes over into warnings given by the poet himself (Hitzig); the admonition of the father thus far refers only in general to the endeavour after wisdom, and we are led to expect that the good doctrines which the father communicates to the son as a viaticum will be further expanded, and become more and more specific when they take a new departure.<p>10 Hearken, my son, and receive my sayings,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So shall the years of life be increased to thee.<p>11 In the way of wisdom have I taught thee,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guided thee in the paths of rectitude.<p>12 When thou goest, thy step shall not be straitened;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.<p>Regarding &#1511;&#1495; (of &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;) of appropriating reception and taking up in succum et sanguinem, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a>; regarding &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, years not merely of the duration of life, but of the enjoyment of life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a>; regarding &#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; (&#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;), path (track), <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>; regarding the &#1489;&#1468; of &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, of the department and subject of instruction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a>.
