Whatever difficulties the righteous meet in the way of duty, they are not daunted. 2. National sins disturb the public repose. 3. If needy persons get opportunities of oppressing, their extortion will be more severe than that of the more wealthy. 4. Wicked people strengthen one another in wicked ways. 5. If a man seeks the Lord, it is a good sign that he understands much, and it is a good means of understanding more. 6. An honest, godly, poor man, is better than a wicked, ungodly, rich man; has more comfort in himself, and is a greater blessing to the world. 7. Companions of riotous men not only grieve their parents, but shame them. 8. That which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long. Thus the poor are repaid, and God is glorified. 9. The sinner at whose prayers God is angry, is one who obstinately refuses to obey God's commands. 10. The success of ungodly men is their own misery. 11. Rich men are so flattered, that they think themselves superior to others. 12. There is glory in the land when the righteous have liberty. 13. It is folly to indulge sin, and excuse it. He who covers his sins, shall not have any true peace. He who humbly confesses his sins, with true repentance and faith, shall find mercy from God. The Son of God is our great atonement. Under a deep sense of our guilt and danger, we may claim salvation from that mercy which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. 14. There is a fear which causes happiness. Faith and love will deliver from the fear of eternal misery; but we should always fear offending God, and fear sinning against him. 15. A wicked ruler, whatever we may call him, this scripture calls a roaring lion, and a ranging bear. 16. Oppressors want understanding; they do not consult their own honour, ease, and safety. 17. The murderer shall be haunted with terrors. None shall desire to save him from deserved punishment, nor pity him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is great glory - Men array themselves in festive apparel, and show their joy conspicuously.<p>A man is hidden - Better, men hide themselves, they shrink and cower for fear, and yet are hunted out. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. great glory&#8212;or, cause for it to a people, for the righteous rejoice in good, and righteousness exalts a nation (Pr 14:34).<p>a man &#8230; hidden&#8212;that is, the good retire, or all kinds try to escape a wicked rule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When righteous men do rejoice, </span> are encouraged and promoted to places of trust and power, there is great glory in that commonwealth.

When it is well with them; when they are in prosperous circumstances; when they are countenanced and encouraged by the government under which they are; when they have the free exercise of their religion; and especially when they are advanced to places of profit, honour, and trust, which must make them cheerful and joyful; it is a glory to a land, it adds greatly to the glory of it, and a fine prospect there is of the increase and continuance of it; <p>but when the wicked rise: to honour and dignity, and are set in high places, and are in great power and authority, which they exercise to the distress of the righteous and all good men: <p>a man is hidden: a good man; he hides himself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-28.htm">Proverbs 28:28</a>; he withdraws himself from court, from city, from company, from commerce, and business, because of the tyranny and persecution of wicked men; and flees to distant places, and wanders in deserts and mountains, in caves and dens of the earth; as some saints, under the Old Testament, did, and as the Church, in Gospel times, fled from the tyranny of antichrist into the wilderness, to hide herself: or, "a man is" or "shall be sought for" (i), and searched out; as wicked persecutors are very diligent to search for and find out such persons that hide themselves, and fetch them out of their hiding places, and cruelly use them. <p>(i) "investigabitur", Pagninus, Montanus; "exploratur", Tigurine version; "explorabitur", Baynus; "pervestigatur", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When righteous <i>men</i> rejoice, <i>there is</i> great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> is hidden.</span><p>(f) He is known by his doings to be wicked.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">a man is hidden</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">men hide themselves</span>, R.V. “Heb. <span class="ital">must be searched for</span>,” marg.

"Rejoice," rather <span class="accented">triumph</span>, as conquerors, right prevailing and wickedness being overcome. Then there is great show of joy, and, as the expression implies, men put on their festal garments to do honorer to the occasion: See the description of Solomon's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20, 25</a>). If we take this verse in connection with ver. 2, we may see in it the triumph of order after a period of confusion and anarchy. Septuagint, "Through the help of righteous men great glory arises." But when the wicked rise, a man is hidden (comp. ver. 28, where, however, the verb is different). The Authorized Version m, one that when the wicked rise to power, people have to hide themselves in order to escape danger to life and property. The verb is more literally rendered, "are searched for," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they have betaken themselves to hiding places, and have to be looked for; they fear oppression and injury, and venture no  longer into the streets and open places. Vulgate,Regnantibus <span class="accented">impiis ruinae hominum</span>, "When evil men are m power, there is general ruin;" Septuagint, "In the places of the ungodly men are caught." Other interpretations of the proverb have been suggested, though none is so satisfactory as that given above. Thus some take the searching out to mean testing, in the sense that evil times try men's characters, and bring out their true nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>). Others explain that, under the reign of the impious, men do not come forward to take part in public affairs, but retire sullenly into private life. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>What is stated in this proverb is a conclusion from the preceding, with which it is also externally connected, for &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; ( equals  &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;), &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, &#1512;&#1506;, and now &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, follow each other:<p>Better a poor man who walketh in his innocence,<p>Than a double-going deceiver who is rich thereby.<p>A variation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1</a>. Stainlessness, integritas vitae, as a consequence of unreserved devotion to God, gives to a man with poverty a higher worth and nobility than riches connected with falsehood which "halts between two opinions" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>), and appears to go one way, while in reality it goes another. The two ways &#1491;&#1468;&#1491;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. Sir. 2:12, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; ... &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;) are, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-18.htm">Proverbs 28:18</a>, not ways going aside to the right or to the left of the right way, but the evil way which the deceiver truly walks in, and the good way which he pretends to walk in (Fleischer); the two ways of action placed over against one another, by one of which he masks the other. </body></html>
