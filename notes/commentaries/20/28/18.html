Uprightness will give men holy security in the worst times; but the false and dishonest are never safe. 19. Those who are diligent, take the way to live comfortably. 20. The true way to be happy, is to be holy and honest; not to raise an estate suddenly, without regard to right or wrong. 21. Judgment is perverted, when any thing but pure right is considered. 22. He that hastens to be rich, never seriously thinks how quickly God may take his wealth from him, and leave him in poverty. 23.

Not that his upright walk is the cause of this; the moving cause of salvation is the grace of God; the procuring cause, our Lord Jesus Christ, the only Author of it: but this is a descriptive character of the persons that are and shall be saved; it is a clear case that such have the grace of God, and therefore shall have glory; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>; <p>but he that is perverse in his ways; "in his two ways", as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>; or many ways, and all perverse and wicked: <p>shall fall at once; his destruction shall come suddenly upon him, when he is not aware of it, and when he cries, Peace, peace, to himself: or in one of them; in one or other of his perverse ways. <p>(r) "erit salvus", Pagninus, Montanus, V.

But a better gloss is &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; 28a: the people let themselves be sought for, they keep themselves concealed in the inside of their houses, they venture not out into the streets and public places (Fleischer), for mistrust and suspicion oppress them all; one regards his person and property nowhere safer than within the four walls of his house; the lively, noisy, variegated life which elsewhere rules without, is as if it were dead. </body></html>
