Whatever difficulties the righteous meet in the way of duty, they are not daunted. 2. National sins disturb the public repose. 3. If needy persons get opportunities of oppressing, their extortion will be more severe than that of the more wealthy. 4. Wicked people strengthen one another in wicked ways. 5. If a man seeks the Lord, it is a good sign that he understands much, and it is a good means of understanding more. 6. An honest, godly, poor man, is better than a wicked, ungodly, rich man; has more comfort in himself, and is a greater blessing to the world. 7. Companions of riotous men not only grieve their parents, but shame them. 8. That which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long. Thus the poor are repaid, and God is glorified. 9. The sinner at whose prayers God is angry, is one who obstinately refuses to obey God's commands. 10. The success of ungodly men is their own misery. 11. Rich men are so flattered, that they think themselves superior to others. 12. There is glory in the land when the righteous have liberty. 13. It is folly to indulge sin, and excuse it. He who covers his sins, shall not have any true peace. He who humbly confesses his sins, with true repentance and faith, shall find mercy from God. The Son of God is our great atonement. Under a deep sense of our guilt and danger, we may claim salvation from that mercy which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. 14. There is a fear which causes happiness. Faith and love will deliver from the fear of eternal misery; but we should always fear offending God, and fear sinning against him. 15. A wicked ruler, whatever we may call him, this scripture calls a roaring lion, and a ranging bear. 16. Oppressors want understanding; they do not consult their own honour, ease, and safety. 17. The murderer shall be haunted with terrors. None shall desire to save him from deserved punishment, nor pity him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unjust gain - Omit "unjust:" "usury and gain" make up the notion of "gain derived from usury."

Not merely the moral law, but the word of God in general, and any and every doctrine of it; though the law is to be heard and attended to, what it commands and forbids, its precepts, menaces, and curses: indeed the Spirit of God is not received by the hearing of the law, nor does faith come by that; but by hearing the word of God, particularly the Gospel; which yet then turn away their ears from, and are turned to fables, and choose to hearken to anything rather than that; and, like the deaf adder, stop their ears to the voice of the charmer, charming ever so wisely; the folly and sad effects of which will be seen when too late; <p>even his prayer shall be abomination; that is, to God; not only his ungodly actions, but even his outward exercises of religion, which carry in them some show of goodness and holiness; and particularly his prayer to God, which in upright persons is the delight of the Lord; yet in such an one it will be abhorred by him; when he is in distress, and shall pray to the Lord, he will not only turn a deaf ear to him, as he has to his law or word, but he will despise and abhor him and his prayer; because he has set at nought his counsel, and despised his reproof, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer <i>shall be</i> <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> abomination.</span><p>(d) Because it is not of faith which is grounded on God's word or law which the wicked contemn.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">abomination</span>] Comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-8.htm" title="The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.">Proverbs 15:8</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that turneth away his ear from hearing the Law.</span> He who refuses to hearken to and to practise the dictates of the Divine law (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Even his prayer shall be abomination</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8</a>, and note there). "God heareth not sinners" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-31.htm">John 9:31</a>). Such a man's prayer, if he does pray, is not hearty and sincere, and therefore, lacks the element which alone can make it acceptable. He will not resolve to forsake his favourite sin, even while paying outward worship to the God whoso Law he breaks: what wonder that the prophet so sternly denounces such offenders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>. etc.), and the psalmist cries with terrible rigour, "When he shall be judged, let him be condemned; and let his prayer become sin" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-7.htm">Psalm 109:7</a>)? St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 10:27), "Our heart blames us in offering up our prayers, when it calls to mind that it is set in opposition to the precepts of him whom it implores, and the prayer becomes abomination, when there is a 'turning away' from the control of the Law; in that wrily it is meet that a man should be a stranger to the favours of him to whose bidding he will not be subject." And again (ibid., 18:9, 10), "If that which he bids we do, that which we ask we shall obtain. For with God both these two do of necessity match with one another exactly, that practice should be sustained by prayer, and prayer by practice" (Oxford transl.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A proverb of a tyrant here connects itself with that of usurpers:<p>A poor man and an oppressor of the lowly - <p>A sweeping rain without bringing bread.<p>Thus it is to be translated according to the accents. Fleischer otherwise, but also in conformity with the accents: Quales sunt vir pauper et oppressor miserorum, tales sunt pluvia omnia secum abripiens et qui panem non habent, i.e., the relation between a poor man and an oppressor of the needy is the same as that between a rain carrying all away with it and a people robbed thereby of their sustenance; in other words: a prince or potentate who robs the poor of their possessions is like a pouring rain which floods the fruitful fields - the separate members of the sentence would then correspond with each other after the scheme of the chiasmus. But the comparison would be faulty, for &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; fall together, and then the explanation would be idem per idem. A "sweeping rain" is one which has only that which is bad, and not that which is good in rain, for it only destroys instead of promoting the growth of the corn; and as the Arab, according to a proverb compared by Hitzig, says of an unjust sultan, that he is a stream without water, so an oppressor of the helpless is appropriately compared to a rain which floods the land and brings no bread. But then the words, "a poor man and an oppressor of the lowly," must designate one person, and in that case the Heb. words must be accentuated, &#1490;&#1489;&#1512; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511; &#1491;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-4.htm">Proverbs 29:4</a>). For, that the oppressor of the helpless deports himself toward the poor man like a sweeping rain which brings no bread, is a saying not intended to be here used, since this is altogether too obvious, that the poor man has nothing to hope for from such an extortioner. But the comparison would be appropriate if 3a referred to an oppressive master; for one who belongs to a master, or who is in any way subordinated to him, has before all to expect from him that which is good, as a requital for his services, and as a proof of his master's condescending sympathy. It is thus asked whether "a poor man and an oppressor of the lowly" may be two properties united in the person of one master. This is certainly possible, for he may be primarily a poor official or an upstart (Zckler), such as were the Roman proconsuls and procurators, who enriched themselves by impoverishing their provinces (cf. lxx <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a>); or a hereditary proprietor, who seeks to regain what he has lost by extorting it from his relatives and workmen. But &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (poor) is not sufficient to give this definite feature to the figure of the master; and what does this feature in the figure of the master at all mean? What the comparison 3b says is appropriate to any oppressive ruler, and one does not think of an oppressor of the poor as himself poor; he may find himself in the midst of shattered possessions, but he is not poor; much rather the oppressor and the poor are, as e.g., at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-13.htm">Proverbs 29:13</a>, contrasted with each other. Therefore we hold, with Hitzig, that &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; of the text is to be read rosh, whether we have to change it into &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, or to suppose that the Jewish transcriber has here for once slipped into the Phoenician writing of the word;<p>(Note: The Phoen. writes &#1512;&#1513; (i.e., &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, rus); vid., Schrder's Phnizische Gram. p. 133; cf. Gesen. Thes. under &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;.)<p>we do not interpret, with Hitzig, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; in the sense of &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, Sir. 8:1, but explain: a man (or master  equals  &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;) is the head (cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-8.htm">Judges 11:8</a>), and oppresses the helpless. This rendering is probable, because &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, a poor man, is a combination of words without a parallel; the Book of Proverbs does not once use the expression &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, but always simply &#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-6.htm">Proverbs 28:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-13.htm">Proverbs 29:13</a>); and &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is compatible with &#1495;&#1499;&#1501; and the like, but not with &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;. If we stumble at the isolated position of &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, we should consider that it is in a certain measure covered by &#1491;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;; for one has to think of the &#1490;&#1489;&#1512;, who is the &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, also as the &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; of these &#1491;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, as one placed in a high station who numbers poor people among his subordinates. The lxx translates &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; as if the words of the text were &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (cf. the interchange of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; and &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; in both texts of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>), but what the lxx read must have been &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; &#1500;&#1492;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1506; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>); and what can &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; here mean? The statement here made refers to the ruinous conduct of a &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, a man of standing, or &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, a high lord, a "wicked ruler," <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a>. On the contrary, what kind of rain the rule of an ideal governor is compared to, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-1.htm">Psalm 72:1-8</a> tells. </body></html>
