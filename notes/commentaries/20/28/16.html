Whatever difficulties the righteous meet in the way of duty, they are not daunted. 2. National sins disturb the public repose. 3. If needy persons get opportunities of oppressing, their extortion will be more severe than that of the more wealthy. 4. Wicked people strengthen one another in wicked ways. 5. If a man seeks the Lord, it is a good sign that he understands much, and it is a good means of understanding more. 6. An honest, godly, poor man, is better than a wicked, ungodly, rich man; has more comfort in himself, and is a greater blessing to the world. 7. Companions of riotous men not only grieve their parents, but shame them. 8. That which is ill got, though it may increase much, will not last long. Thus the poor are repaid, and God is glorified. 9. The sinner at whose prayers God is angry, is one who obstinately refuses to obey God's commands. 10. The success of ungodly men is their own misery. 11. Rich men are so flattered, that they think themselves superior to others. 12. There is glory in the land when the righteous have liberty. 13. It is folly to indulge sin, and excuse it. He who covers his sins, shall not have any true peace. He who humbly confesses his sins, with true repentance and faith, shall find mercy from God. The Son of God is our great atonement. Under a deep sense of our guilt and danger, we may claim salvation from that mercy which reigns through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord. 14. There is a fear which causes happiness. Faith and love will deliver from the fear of eternal misery; but we should always fear offending God, and fear sinning against him. 15. A wicked ruler, whatever we may call him, this scripture calls a roaring lion, and a ranging bear. 16. Oppressors want understanding; they do not consult their own honour, ease, and safety. 17. The murderer shall be haunted with terrors. None shall desire to save him from deserved punishment, nor pity him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The form of political wretchedness, when the poverty of the oppressed subjects not only embitters their sufferings, but exasperates the brutal ferocity of the ruler. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Or, "much in oppressions" (o); he multiplies them, and abounds in them; he distresses his subjects in a variety of ways and methods he uses to extort money from them by which he shows his want of understanding: he is a wise prince that uses gentle methods, and gains the affections of his people, and who cheerfully supports his crown and government with honour and glory; but he is a foolish prince that uses them with rigour. It may be rendered, "and a prince that wanteth understanding, and is much", or "abounds, in oppressions"; in laying heavy burdens and taxes on his people, in an arbitrary manner; "shall shorten, and not prolong his days" (p), as it may be supplied from the next clause; either his subjects will rise up against him, and dethrone him, and destroy him; or God, in mercy to them, and in judgment to him, will remove him by death; <p>but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days; to hate covetousness is a good qualification of a civil magistrate, prince, or ruler, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>. This sin is the cause of a wicked prince oppressing his subjects; but where it is hated, which is seen by moderation in government, and easing of the people as much as possible; such a prince, as he has the hearts of his subjects, is well pleasing to God, by whom he reigns; and such an one, through the prayers of the people for him, and the goodness of God unto him, lives long, and reigns prosperously; and dies, as David, in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour. <p>(o)  "multus oppressionibus", Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremeilius, Piscator, Mercerus, Baynus, Michaelis, Schultens.

There is no particle of connection or contrast between the two clauses of the verse, and R.V. marg. adopts the view that the whole verse is a continuous address or admonition: <span class="ital">O prince that lackest understanding and art a great oppressor, he that</span>, &c.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and rich in oppression</span>. Ewald, Delitzsch, Nowack, and others take the verse, not as a statement, but as a warning addressed to the ruler, as we have so many addressed to a son, and as the author of the Book of Wisdom calls upon the judges of the earth  to listen to his admonitions. They therefore render thus: "O prince, void of understanding, but rich in oppression!" The wording and accentuation of the passage confirm this view. Caher renders, "A prince that wants understanding increases his exactions." The want of intelligence makes a prince cruel and tyrannical and callous to suffering: not possessing the wisdom and prudence necessary for right government, he defrauds his subjects, treats them unjustly, and causes great misery. See the prophet's denunciation of Shallum and Jehoiakim for these very crimes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-19</a>). Septuagint, "A king wanting revenues is a great oppresser (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">He that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>). The prince addressed is thus warned that his oppressive acts will be visited upon him judicially; that only a ruler who deals with his subjects liberally and equitably can attain to old age, and that his conduct will shorten his life. An early death is reckoned as a token of God's indignation. The second hemistich Caher translates, "But he who hates lucre shall reign long." Septuagint, "He who hateth iniquity shall live a long time." (For "covetousness" (<span class="accented">betsa</span>), see on Proverbs 1:19.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A tristich beginning with a participle:<p>He who misleads the upright into an evil way,<p>He shall fall into his own pit;<p>But the innocent shall inherit that which is good.<p>In the first case, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a> is fulfilled: the deceiver who leads astray falls himself into the destruction which he prepared for others, whether he misleads them into sin, and thus mediately prepares destruction for them, or that he does this immediately by enticing them into this or that danger; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1512;&#1506; may be understood of the way of wicked conduct, as well as of the experience of evil, of being betrayed, robbed, or even murdered. That those who are misled are called &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, explains itself in the latter case: that they are such as he ought to show respect towards, and such as deserved better treatment, heightens the measure of his guilt. If we understand being morally led astray, yet may we not with Hitzig here find the "theory" which removes the punishment from the just and lays it on the wicked. The clause <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-8.htm">Proverbs 11:8</a> is not here applicable. The first pages of the Scripture teach that the deceiver does not by any means escape punishment; but certainly the deceiver of the upright does not gain his object, for his diabolical joy at the destruction of such an one is vain, because God again helps him with the right way, but casts the deceiver so much the deeper down. As the idea of &#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1512;&#1506; has a twofold direction, so the connections of the words may be genitival (via mali) as well as adjectival (via mala). &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; is not incorrectly written for &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1493;, for &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514; occurs (only here) with &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; as its warrant both from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492;, to bend, to sink; cf. &#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-24.htm">Proverbs 4:24</a>. In line third, opposite to "he who misleads," stand "the innocent" (pious), who, far from seeking to entice others into the evil way and bring them to ruin, are unreservedly and honestly devoted to God and to that which is good; these shall inherit good (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>); even the consciousness of having made no man unhappy makes them happy; but even in their external relations there falls to them the possession of all good, which is the divinely ordained reward of the good. </body></html>
