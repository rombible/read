But to bribe a judge with a morsel of bread seems an unlikely idea; and the gnome is of general application, "And for a morsel of bread a man [not 'that man'] will transgress." As some men in responsible positions are often swayed by low and unworthy considerations, so in social life a very insignificant cause is sufficient to warp the judgment of some persons, or draw them aside from the line of rectitude. (For "a piece of bread," as denoting abject poverty or a thing of no value, see on Proverbs 6:26) The commentators cite Aul. Gell., 'Noct. Att.,' 1:15, "Frusto panis conduci potest vel uti taceat vel uti loquatur." Septuagint, "He that regards not the persons of the just is not good; such a cue will sell a man for a morsel of bread." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This general ethical proverb is now followed by one concerning the king:<p>15 A roaring lion and a ravening bear<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is a foolish ruler over a poor people,<p>i.e., a people without riches and possessions, without lasting sources of help - a people brought low by the events of war and by calamities.
