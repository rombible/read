As every man that is eagerly desirous of riches is; he would be rich at once (z), and cannot wait with any patience in the ordinary course of means: <p>hath an evil eye; on the substance of others, to get it, right or wrong; is an evil man, and takes evil methods to be rich (a); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>; or an envious one; is an envious man; as the Septuagint and Arabic versions; he envies others, as the Vulgate Latin version, the riches of other men; he grudges everything that goes beside himself; and that makes him in haste to be rich, that he may be equal to or superior to others: or he is a sordid, avaricious, illiberal man, that will not part with anything for the relief, for others, and is greedy of everything to amass wealth to himself; an evil eye is opposed to a good or bountiful one, that is, to a man that is liberal and generous, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>; <p>and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him; for wealth gotten hastily, and especially wrongfully, diminishes, wastes, and comes to nothing in the end; it sometimes flies away as fast as it comes; it has wings to do the one, as well as the other: this the man in haste to be rich does not consider, or he would have taken another method; since this is not the true way of getting and keeping riches, but of losing them, and coming to want; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-11.htm">Proverbs 13:11</a>. <p>(z) "Nam dives qui fieri vult, et cito vult fieri", Juvenal.

The order of subject and predicate should be reversed as in A.V. marg. and R.V.: <span class="ital">He that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches</span>. After the manner of this Collection, we have three proverbs (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/28-20.htm" title="A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent....">Proverbs 28:20-21</a></span>) on the same subject brought together.

The man of evil eye (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a>) is the envious and covetous man; such a one tries to improve his position and raise himself speedily to the height of him whom he envies, and is quite unscrupulous as to the means which he uses to effect his purpose, and keeps all that he gains selfishly to himself. And yet he is really blind to his own best interests (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-21.htm">Proverbs 20:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And considereth not that poverty shall come upon him</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-4.htm">Proverbs 23:4, 5</a>). His grasping greed brings no blessing with it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>), excites others to defraud him, and in the end consigns him to merited poverty. The LXX. here reads somewhat differently, and translates, "An envious man hasteth to be rich, and knows not that the merciful man (<span class="accented">chasid</span> instead of <span class="accented">cheser</span>) will I,ave the mastery over him," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. will take his wealth, as ver. 8. Proverbs concerning hastily gotten wealth have already been given. Here are a few more: Spanish, "Who would be rich in a year gets hanged in half a year;" Italian, "The river does not become swollen with clear water;" says a Scotch proverb, "Better a wee fire to warm as than a meikle fire to burn us." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Another proverb of the king:<p>O prince devoid of understanding and rich in oppression!<p>He that hateth unrighteous gain continueth long.<p>The old interpreters from the lxx interpret &#1502;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1489;&#1493; as pred. (as also Fleischer: princeps qui intelligentiae habet parum idem oppressionis exercet multum); but why did not the author use the word &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; or &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; instead of this ambiguous inconvenient &#1493;? Hitzig regards the first term as a nominative absolute, which does not assume a suffix in the second line. But examples such as 27a, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-7.htm">Proverbs 27:7</a>, are altogether of a different sort; there occurs a reference that is in reality latent, and only finds not expression; the clause following the nominative is related to it as its natural predicate, but here 15b is an independent clause standing outside of any syntactical relation to 15a. Heidenheim has acknowledged that here there lies before us a proverb not in the form of a mere declaration, but of a warning address, and thus also it is understood by Ewald, Bertheau, Elster, and Zckler. The accentuation seems to proceed on the same supposition. It is the only passage in the Book of Proverbs where &#1504;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491;, of the supreme ruler of the people, and where the plur. &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, occur; it is not therefore at all strange if the proverb also has something strange in its formation. Often enough, proverbs are in the form of an address to a son, and generally to their reader; why not also one at least to the king? It is a proverb as when I:say: Oh thou reckless, merry fellow! he who laughs much will sometimes weep long. Thus here the address is directed to the prince who is devoid of all wisdom and intelligence, which are necessary for a prince; but on this account the more earnest in exhortation to say to him that only one who hates defrauding the people attains an old age; thus that a prince who plunders the people wantonly shortens his life as a man, and his position as a ruler (cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22</a>). The Ker&#305;&#770; &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488; has the tone thrown back on the penult., as the Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497; would also have it, cf. &#1500;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-9.htm">Proverbs 8:9</a>. The relation of a plur. subj. to a sing. pred. is as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-16.htm">Proverbs 27:16</a>. Regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>. A confirmation of this proverb directing itself to princes if found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-19</a>, the woe pronounced upon Jehoiakim. And a glance at the woe pronounced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-12.htm">Habakkuk 2:12</a>, shows how easily <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17</a> presents itself in connection. </body></html>
