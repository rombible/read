Jarchi reads it, they are the "snares of death" to him; and so the Septuagint version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">a vanity</span> &c.] Lit. <span class="bld">a vapour dispersed; seekers of death</span>. Thus in the abrupt, sententious style of the wisdom of the East the end is described both of the treasures so sought, and of those who so seek them. “A vapour dispersed,” unsubstantial and vanishing away are the treasures gotten by a lying tongue; “seekers of death,” men whose pursuit will end in their own destruction, are those who so acquire them.

The latter clause is variously rendered and interpreted. The Hebrew is literally, <span class="accented">a fleeting breath, those seeking death.</span> The Revised Version makes the last words a separate proposition, "They that seek them seek death." But this seems unnecessary, and somewhat opposed to the gnomic style, which often combines two predicates in one construction; and there is no reason why we should not render the words, as in the Authorized Version, "of seekers of death." Such a mode of obtaining wealth is as evanescent and unstable as the very breath, and ends in death, which is practically the result of their quest. Thus Wisd. 5:14, "The hope of the ungodly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with the tempest, and passeth away. as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day." Some think that the comparison regards the mirage of the desert, which deceives travellers with the phantasms of cool waters and refreshing shade. Such an allusion is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>. The Talmud enjoins, "Speak no word that accords not with the truth, that thy honour may not vanish as the waters of a brook." The Septuagint and Vulgate have followed a different reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>), and render thus: Vulgate, <span class="accented">Vanus et excors est, et impingetur ad laqueos mortis</span>, "He is vain and foolish, and will be taken in the snares of death;" Septuagint, "pursues vain things unto the snares of death (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>). So St. Paul says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), "They that desire to be rich fall into a into a temptation and a snare (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>), and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>30 Cutting wounds cleanse away evil,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And reach the inner parts of the body.<p>The two words for wounds in line first stand in the st. constr.; &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; (from &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;, to be bound around with stripes, to be striped) is properly the streak, the stripe; but is here heightened by &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506; (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, to cleave, split, tear open), beyond the idea of the stripe-wound: tearing open the flesh, cuts tearing into the flesh. The pred. is after the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;; but this substantive, found in the Book of Esther, where it signifies the purification of the women for the harem (according to which, e.g., Ahron B. Joseph explains &#1499;&#1502;&#1493; &#1514;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511; &#1500;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1497;&#1508;&#1492; &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;), is syntactically hard, and scarcely original. For if we explain with Kimchi: wounds of deep incision find their cleansing (cure) by evil, i.e., by means which bring suffering (according to which, probably the Venet. &#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;), then &#1514;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;&#1503;, with the pronoun pointing back, one would have expected. But the interpretation of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, of severe means of cure, is constrained; that which lies nearest, however, is to understand &#1512;&#1506; of evil. But if, with this understanding of the word, we translate: Vibices plagarum sunt lustratio quae adhibetur malo (Fleischer), one does not see why &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, and not rather gen. &#1512;&#1506;, is used. But if we read after the Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;, then all is syntactically correct; for (1.) that the word &#1497;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;, or &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, is not used, is in accordance with a well-known rule, Gesen. 146. 3; and (2.) that &#1492;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511; is connected, not directly with an accus. obj., but with &#1489;, has its analogy in &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1492; &#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-2.htm">Jeremiah 42:2</a>, &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-12.htm">Job 31:12</a>, and the like, and besides has its special ground in the metaphorical character of the cleansing. Thus, e.g., one uses Syr. 't'aa' of external misleading; but with Syr. k of moral misleading (Ewald, 217, 2); and Arab. '_ of erecting a building; but with Arab. b of the intellectual erection of a memorial (monument). It is the so-called Ba&#770;&#775;a&#770;lmoja&#770;z; vid., de Sacy's Chrest Arab. i. 397. The verb &#1502;&#1512;&#1511; means in Talm. also, "to take away" (a metaph. of abstergere; cf. Arab. marak, to wipe off)<p>(Note: Vid., Dozy's Lettre  M. Fleischer (1871), p. 198.)<p>and that meaning is adopted, Schabbath 33a, for the interpretations of this proverb: stripes and wounds a preparedness for evil carries away, and sorrow in the innermost part of the body, which is explained by &#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1511;&#1503; (a disease appearing in diverse forms; cf. "Drachenschuss,"; as the name of an animal disease); but granting that the biblical &#1502;&#1512;&#1511; may bear this meaning, the &#1489; remains unaccountable; for we say &#1502;&#1512;&#1511; &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1493; &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;, for to prepare oneself for a transgression (sin of excess), and not &#1489;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1492;. We have thus to abide by the primary meaning, and to compare the proverb, Berachoth 5a: "afflictive providences wash away all the transgressions of a man." But the proverb before us means, first at least, not the wounds which God inflicts, but those which human educational energy inflicts: deep-cutting wounds, i.e., stern discipline, leads to the rubbing off of evil, i.e., rubs it, washes it, cleanses it away. It may now be possible that in 30b the subject idea is permutatively continued: et verbera penetralium corporis (thus the Venet.: &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), i.e., quorum vis ad intimos corporis et animi recessus penetrat (Fleischer). But that is encumbered, and &#1495;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1496;&#1503; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-27.htm">Proverbs 20:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-8.htm">Proverbs 18:8</a>), as referring to the depths to which stern corporal discipline penetrates, has not its full force. &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is either a particip.: and that is touching (ferientes) the inner chambers of the body, or &#1495;&#1491;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1496;&#1503; is with the &#1489;, or immediately the second object of &#1514;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1511; to be supplied: and strokes (rub off, cleanse, make pure) the innermost part. Jerome and the Targ. also supply &#1489;, but erroneously, as designating place: in secretioribus ventris, relatively better the lxx and Syr.: &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;. Luther hits the sense at least, for he translates:<p>One must restrain evil with severe punishment,<p>And with hard strokes which one feels. </body></html>
