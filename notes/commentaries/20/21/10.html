It is best to shun bitter contention by pouring out the heart before God. For by prudence and patience, with constant prayer, the cross may be removed. 10. The evil desires of a wicked man's heart, lead to baseness in his conduct. 11. The simple may be made wise by punishments on the wicked, and by instructions to those who are willing to be taught. 12. Good men envy not the prosperity of evil-doers; they see there is a curse on them. 13. Such as oppress the poor by beating down wages, such as will not relieve according to their ability those in distress, and those in authority who neglect to do justice, stop their ears at the cry of the poor. But doubtless care is to be used in the exercise of charity. 14. If money can conquer the fury of the passions, shall reason, the fear of God, and the command of Christ, be too weak to bridle them? 15. There is true pleasure only in the practice of religion. 16. Of all wanderers in the ways of sin, those are in the most dangerous condition who turn aside into the ways of darkness. Yet there is hope even for them in the all-sufficient Saviour; but let them flee to him without delay. 17. A life of worldly pleasure brings ruin on men. 18. The righteous is often delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes in his stead, and so seems as a ransom for him. 19. Unbridled passions spoil the comfort of all relations. 20. The plenty obtained by prudence, industry, and frugality, is desirable. But the foolish misspend what they have upon their lusts. 21. True repentance and faith will lead him that relies on the mercy of God in Christ, to follow after righteousness and mercy in his own conduct. 22. Those that have wisdom, often do great things, even against those confident of their strength. 23. It is our great concern to keep our souls from being entangled and disquieted. 24. Pride and haughtiness make men passionate; such continually deal in wrath, as if it were their trade to be angry. 25,26. Here is the misery of the slothful; their hands refuse to labour in an honest calling, by which they might get an honest livelihood; yet their hearts cease not to covet riches, pleasures, and honours, which cannot be obtained without labour. But the righteous and industrious have their desires satisfied. 27. When holiness is pretended, but wickedness intended, that especially is an abomination. 28. The doom of a false witness is certain. 29. A wicked man bids defiance to the terrors of the law and the rebukes of Providence. But a good man asks, What does God require of me? 30,31. Means are to be used, but, after all, our safety and salvation are only of the Lord. In our spiritual warfare we must arm ourselves with the whole armour of God; but our strength must be in the Lord, and in the power of his might.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A wide house - literally, "a house of companionship," i. e., a house shared with her. The flat roof of an Eastern house was often used for retirement by day, or in summer for sleep by night. The corner of such a roof was exposed to all changes of weather, and the point of the proverb lies in the thought that all winds and storms which a man might meet with there are more endurable than the tempest within. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

The evil of sin, it being natural to him; he chooses it, delights in it, craves after it, under a notion of pleasure or profit: or the evil of mischief; it is a sport and pastime to him to do injury to others; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-23.htm">Proverbs 10:23</a>; he desires both the one and the other with all his soul; his heart is in it, he is set upon it, which shows him to be a wicked man; <p>his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes; not only he delights to do mischief to an enemy or a stranger, but even to a neighbour and friend; he will do him no kindness, though he asks it of him; he will show him no mercy, though an object of it; he will spare him not, but do him an injury, if he attempts to hinder or dissuade him from doing mischief, or reproves him for it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The soul of the wicked desireth veil.</span> A wicked man cannot rest without planning and wishing for some new evil thing. Nothing is safe from his malignant activity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-16.htm">Proverbs 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-23.htm">Proverbs 10:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>). He does not look with pity on friend or neighbour, if they stand in the way of the gratification of his desires; he will sacrifice any one, however closely connected, so that he may work his will. Nothing makes a man more atrociously selfish and hard-hearted than vice (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, and the note there). The LXX. takes the sentence in a passive sense, "The soul of the ungodly shall not be pitied by any one." They who have no pity for others shall meet with no pity themselves; while, on the other hand, the Lord says, "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-7.htm">Matthew 5:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>4 Loftiness of eyes and swelling of heart - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The husbandry of the godless is sin.<p>If &#1504;&#1512;, in the sense of light, gives a satisfactory meaning, then one might appeal to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>), where &#1504;&#1497;&#1512; appears to signify lamp, in which meaning it is once (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-29.htm">2 Samuel 22:29</a>) written &#1504;&#1497;&#1512; (like &#1495;&#1497;&#1511;); or since &#1504;&#1497;&#1512;  equals  &#1504;&#1512; (ground-form, nawir, lightening) is as yet certainly established neither in the Heb. nor Syr., one might punctuate &#1504;&#1512; instead of &#1504;&#1512;, according to which the Greeks, Aram., and Luther, with Jerome, translate. But of the lamp of the godless we read at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a> and elsewhere, that it goeth out. We must here understand by &#1504;&#1512; the brilliant prosperity (Bertheau and others) of the wicked, or their "proud spirit flaming and flaring like a bright light" (Zckler), which is contrary to the use of the metaphor as found elsewhere, which does not extend to a prosperous condition. We must then try another meaning for &#1504;&#1512;; but not that of yoke, for this is not Heb., but Aram.-Arab., and the interpretation thence derived by Lagarde: "Haughtiness and pride; but the godless for all that bear their yoke, viz., sin," seeks in vain to hide behind the "for all that" the breaking asunder of the two lines of the verse. In Heb. &#1504;&#1512; means that which lightens (burning)  equals  lamp, &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, the shining (that which burns)  equals  fire, and &#1504;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-23.htm">Proverbs 13:23</a>, from &#1504;&#1497;&#1512;, to plough up (Targ. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-12.htm">1 Samuel 8:12</a>, &#1500;&#1502;&#1504;&#1512;  equals  &#1500;&#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;) the fresh land, i.e., the breaking up of the fallow land; according to which the Venet. as Kimchi: &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, which as Ewald and Elster explain: "where a disposition of wicked haughtiness, of unbridled pride, prevails, there will also sin be the first-fruit on the field of action; &#1504;&#1512;, novale, the field turned up for the first time, denotes here the first-fruits of sin." But why just the first-fruits, and not the fruit in general? We are better to abide by the field itself, which is here styled &#1504;&#1512;, not &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; (or as once in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-10.htm">Jeremiah 39:10</a>, &#1497;&#1490;&#1489;); because with this word, more even than with &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, is connected the idea of agricultural work, of arable land gained by the digging up or the breaking up of one or more years' fallow ground (cf. Pea ii. 1, &#1504;&#1497;&#1512;, Arab. sik&#803;a&#770;k&#803;, opp. &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, Arab. bu&#770;r, Menachoth 85a, &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, a fresh broken-up field, Erachin 29b, &#1504;&#1512; ,, opp. &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, to let lie fallow), so that &#1504;&#1512; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; may mean the cultivation of the fields, and generally the husbandry, i.e., the whole conduct and life of the godless. &#1504;&#1512; is here ethically metaph., but not like <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-3.htm">Jeremiah 4:3</a>, where it means a new moral commencement of life; but like &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, arare, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-29.htm">Proverbs 3:29</a>. &#1512;&#1495;&#1489; is not adj. like <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-25.htm">Proverbs 28:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/101-5.htm">Psalm 101:5</a>, but infin. like &#1495;&#1505;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-21.htm">Proverbs 10:21</a>; and accordingly also &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is not adj. like &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, or past like &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;, but infin. like <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>. And &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; is the pred. of the complex subject, which consists of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, a haughty looking down with the eyes, &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;, breadth of heart, i.e., excess of self-consciousness, and &#1504;&#1512; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; taken as an asyndeton summativum: pride of look, and making oneself large of heart, in short, the whole husbandry of the godless, or the whole of the field cultivated by them, with all that grows thereon, is sin. </body></html>
