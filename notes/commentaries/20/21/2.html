We are partial in judging ourselves and our actions. 3. Many deceive themselves with a conceit that outward devotions will excuse unrighteousness. 4. Sin is the pride, the ambition, the glory, the joy, and the business of wicked men. 5. The really diligent employ foresight as well as labour. 6. While men seek wealth by unlawful practices, they seek death. 7. Injustice will return upon the sinner, and will destroy him here and for ever. 8.

This is repeated, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>; for the confirmation of it; and that it might be observed and taken notice of, and men be brought under a conviction of it; which is not easily done, it being what affects all men: every man is conceited of himself and his own way, and is not easily persuaded off of it; his sinful ways are agreeable to him promising him pleasure, profit, or honour; and his self-righteous ways suit with the vain opinion he has of himself, whereby he promises himself eternal life and happiness. The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it to this sense, <p>"every man seems righteous to himself;'' <p>but the Lord pondereth the hearts: weighs them in the balance of righteousness and truth; considers them, having a perfect knowledge of them, and all the springs of action in them; and knows that every way of man is not right, though they may seem so to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>.

For &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503; with &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; is, without doubt, the wheel of the threshing-cart, &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>.; and thus with &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492;, the winnowing fork, &#1502;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; is to be thought of; vid., a description of them along with that of the winnowing shovel, &#1512;&#1495;&#1514;, in Wetzstein's Excursus to Isa., p. 707ff. We are not to think of the punishment of the wheel, which occurs only as a terrible custom of war (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>). It is only meant that a wise king, by sharp and vigorous procedure, separates the godless, and immediately visits them with merited punishment, as he who works with the winnowing shovel gives the chaff to the wind. Most ancient interpreters think on &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503; (from &#1488;&#1508;&#1503;, vertere) in its metaphorical meaning: &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (thus also Lwenstein, he deals with them according to merit), or the wheel of fortune, with reference to the constellations; thus, misfortune (Immanuel, Meri). Arama, Oetinger, and others are, however, on the right track. </body></html>
