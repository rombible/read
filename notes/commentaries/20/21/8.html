Not the way of any and every man; not the way of righteous and good men, of believers in Christ; who know him, the way, and walk in him and after him, and being led by him; who have his spirit to be their guide, and do walk in his ways, and find pleasure in them; the way of such is not froward or perverse, but upright and even, and is not strange, for the Lord knows and approves of it: but the way of wicked and impure men, as may be learned from the opposition in the next clause; the way of unregenerate men, who are gone out of the good way, and turned to their own way, which is according to the course of the world, and after the prince of it, and according to the flesh, and dictates of corrupt nature, which is the common and broad road that leads to destruction. This is a "froward" or perverse way, a way contrary to reason and truth; contrary to the word of God, and the directions of it; it is a crooked distorted path; it is not according to rule; it is a deviation from the way of God's commandment, and is a "strange" one; the Scriptures know nothing of it, and do not point and direct unto it; it estranges a man from God, and carries him further and further off from him. It may be rendered, "perverse is the way of a man, even of a stranger" (t); of one that is a stranger to God and godliness; to Christ and his Gospel; to the Spirit, and the operations of his grace on the heart; to his own heart, and his state and condition by nature; and to all good men, and all that is good; <p>but as for the pure, his work is right. God is pure, purity itself, in comparison of whom nothing is pure; and his work in creation, providence, and grace, is right; there is no unrighteousness in him; and this sense is favoured by the Septuagint and Arabic versions: or rather every good man, who, through the pure righteousness of Christ imputed to him, and through his precious blood being sprinkled on him, or rather through being washed in it, and through the grace of God bestowed on him, is pure, wholly cleansed from sin; has a pure heart, speaks a pure language, and holds the mystery of faith in a pure conscience or conversation: and his work, or the work of God upon him, is right and good; or his work of faith, which he exercises on God, is hearty and genuine: and even his works, as the Targum, Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, have it in the plural number; all his good works are right; being done from love, in faith, in the name and strength of Christ, and to the glory of God. <p>(t) "et alieni", Pagninus, Montanus; "et extranei", Vatablus; so Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">The way of man</span> is <span class="ital">froward and strange</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">very crooked is the way of a man laden with guilt</span>; as was the way of David when he was laden with the guilt of adultery, 2 Samuel 11. The annals of crime in every land and age illustrate the proverb.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The way of man is froward and strange;</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Perversa via viri, aliens est</span>. Both this and the Authorized Version miss the antithesis between the guilty and the pure man, which is intended. In <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;</span>, translated "and strange" (which seems to mean "alien from what is right"), the <span class="accented">vav</span> is not the copulative, but part of the word, which is an adjective signifying "laden with guilt;" so that the clause ought to be rendered, "Crooked is the way of a guilty man" (see note on Proverbs 2:15, where, however, the word is different, though the idea is analogous). An evil man's way of life is not open and straightforward, simple and uniform, but stealthy, crooked, perverse, whither his evil inclinations lead him. Septuagint, "To the crooked (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>) God sendeth crooked ways;" which recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>, "With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward." God allows the wicked to punish themselves by falling into mischief. <span class="cmt_word">As for the pure, his work is right;</span> or, <span class="accented">straight</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11</a>). The pure in heart will be right in action; he follows his conscience and God's law, and goes direct on his course without turning or hesitation. The LXX. refers the clause to God: "for pure and right are his ways." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The next group extends from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a> to <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8</a>, where it closes as it began.<p>2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But a weigher of hearts is Jahve.<p>A proverb similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a> (where &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;, for &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, &#1494;&#1498; for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;). God is also, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a>, called a trier, &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1503;, of hearts, as He is here called a weigher, &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503;. The proverb indirectly admonishes us of the duty of constant self-examination, according to the objective norm of the revealed will of God, and warns us against the self-complacency of the fool, of whom <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a> says (as Trimberg in "Renner"): "all fools live in the pleasant feeling that their life is the best," and against the self-deception which walks in the way of death and dreams of walking in the way of life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-25.htm">Proverbs 16:25</a>). </body></html>
