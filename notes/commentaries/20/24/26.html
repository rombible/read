The pleasure we are apt to take in the troubles of an enemy is forbidden. 19,20. Envy not the wicked their prosperity; be sure there is no true happiness in it. 21,22. The godly in the land, will be quiet in the land. There may be cause to change for the better, but have nothing to do with them that are given change. 23-26. The wisdom God giveth, renders a man fit for his station. Every one who finds the benefit of the right answer, will be attached to him that gave it. 27.

An answer that is fair and suitable to the circumstances is as pleasant and assuring to the bearers as a kiss on the lips. Such a salutation would be a natural sign of sympathy and affection. Thus Absalom won the hearts of the people by kissing those who came to court with their suits (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-5.htm">2 Samuel 15:5</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40</a>, where the Authorized Version has, "According to thy word shall all my people be ruled," the Hebrew runs, "Thy mouth shall all my people kiss," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they shall do homage to thee, which is another signification of this action. This, however, would not be suitable here, as the kiss is supposed to be given by the speaker, though the LXX. mistakenly translates, "But men will kiss lips that answer good words." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Warning against envying the godless for their external prosperity:<p>19 Be not enraged on account of evil-doers,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Envy not the godless;<p>20 For the wicked men shall have no future,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light of the godless is extinguished.<p>Ver. 19 is a variation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-21.htm">Proverbs 3:21</a> (where with &#1489;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; following the traditional &#1514;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; is more appropriate than &#1514;&#1514;&#1495;&#1512;, which Hupfeld would here insert). &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1512; is fut. apoc. of &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, to be heated (to be indignant), distinguished from the Tiphel &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, to be jealous. The ground and occasion of being enraged, and on the other side, of jealousy or envy, is the prosperity of the godless, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>. This anger at the apparently unrighteous division of fortune, this jealousy at the success in which the godless rejoice, rest on short-sightedness, which regards the present, and looks not on to the end. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, merely as in the expression '&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;, 14b (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-37.htm">Psalm 37:37</a>), always denotes the happy, glorious issue indemnifying for past sufferings. Such an issue the wicked man has not; his light burns brightly on this side, but one day it is extinguished. In 20b is repeated <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a>. </body></html>
