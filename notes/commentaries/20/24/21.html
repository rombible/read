First the Lord, and then the king; and such as fear the Lord are generally loyal to their king; the fear of God includes love to him, reverence of him, faith in him, submission to him, and the whole worship of him, inward and outward, attended with holiness of life and conversation: and the king, who is under God, is to be feared also, with a fear suitable to him; he is to be loved and reverenced, to be trusted in and submitted to, in everything consistent with the fear of God and obedience to him; in whatever is not contrary to his laws, commands, and ordinances; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>; <p>and meddle not with them that are given to change; in political things; that are for new laws, new forms of government, a new ministry, and a new king; never easy with the government under which they are, but are continually entering into plots, conspiracies, and rebellions, who, instead of fearing God and the king, change the laws and commandments of God and the king, and therefore to be shunned. Some render it, "with rebels"; the Targum and Syriac version, "with fools"; as all such persons are, and should be avoided as scandalous and dangerous: mix not with them, as the word (s) signifies; keep no company, and have no conversation with them, lest you be brought into danger and mischief by them. Or who are given to change in religious things; make innovations in doctrine and practice, always love to hear or say some now thing; turn with every wind, and shift as that does; are tossed about with every wind of doctrine, fickle and inconstant, carried about like meteors in the air, with "divers and strange doctrines"; such as disagree with the perfections of God, the doctrines of Christ and his apostles, the Scriptures of truth, the analogy of faith, anti form of sound words; and so the word here used signifies "divers", and is so rendered <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8</a>; and may design such who hold doctrines and give into practices divers and different from the faith once delivered to the saints, and from the institutions and appointments of Christ; innovations in doctrine and worship ought not to be admitted of; and such who are for introducing them should not be meddled or mixed with; they should not be countenanced and encouraged; they should not be attended upon or given heed unto; have no fellowship, and join not in communion with them. This is interpreted by some of such who repeat (t) their sins after repentance, or who return a second time to their wickedness after they have repented, as Ben Melech observes. <p>(s)  "ne misceas te", Pagninus, Montanus; "ne commisceto te", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, so Michaelis, Schultens.

The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> signifies transitively "to repeat," and intransitively "to be changed;" so it may be most accurately translated here, with Delitzsch, "those who are otherwise disposed," who have not the proper sentiments of fear and honour for God and the king. St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Et cum detractoribus non commiscearis</span>, by which word he probably means what we call revolutionists, persons who disparage and despise all authority. Septuagint, "Fear God and the king, and disobey neither of them." The verse has been largely used as a text by preachers who desired to recommend loyalty and to censure disaffection and rebellion. It has been a favourite motto for discourses on the Gunpowder Treason and the execution of Charles I. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>15 Lie not in wait, oh wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assault not his resting-place.<p>16 For seven times doth the righteous fall and rise again,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the wicked are overthrown when calamity falls on them.<p>The &#1488;&#1512;&#1489; [lying in wait] and &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1491; [practising violence], against which the warning is here given, are not directed, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a>, immediately against the person, but against the dwelling-place and resting-place (&#1512;&#1489;&#1509;, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-6.htm">Jeremiah 50:6</a>, as also &#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, 3:33) of the righteous, who, on his part, does injustice and wrong to no one; the warning is against coveting his house, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>, and driving him by cunning and violence out of it. Instead of &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, Symmachus and Jerome have incorrectly read &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; daer, and from this misunderstanding have here introduced a sense without sense into <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-15.htm">Proverbs 24:15</a>; many interpreters (Lwenstein, Ewald, Elster, and Zckler) translate with Luther appositionally: as a wicked man, i.e., "with mischievous intent," like one stealthily lurking for the opportunity of taking possession of the dwelling of another, as if this could be done with a good intent: &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; is the vocative (Syr., Targ., Venet.: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c2;), and this address (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-5.htm">Psalm 75:5</a>.) sharpens the warning, for it names him who acts in this manner by the right name.
