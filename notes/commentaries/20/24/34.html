See what a blessing the husbandman's calling is, and what a wilderness this earth would be without it. See what great difference there is in the management even of worldly affairs. Sloth and self-indulgence are the bane of all good. When we see fields overgrown with thorns and thistles, and the fences broken down, we see an emblem of the far more deplorable state of many souls. Every vile affection grows in men's hearts; yet they compose themselves to sleep.

Other designations stood for false witnesses (lxx, Syr., Targ.). Rightly Jerome, the Venet., and Luther, without, however, rendering the gen. connection &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1495;&#1504;&#1501;, as it might have been by the adj.<p>In 28b, Chajg derives &#1493;&#1492;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; from &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;, to break in pieces, to crumble; for he remarks it might stand, with the passing over of  into , for &#1493;&#1492;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; [and thou wilt whisper]. But the ancients had no acquaintance with the laws of sound, and therefore with naive arbitrariness regarded all as possible; and Bttcher, indeed, maintains that the Hiphil of &#1508;&#1514;&#1514; may be &#1492;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; as well as &#1492;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;; but the former of these forms with  could only be metaplastically possible, and would be &#1492;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; (vid., Hitzig under <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>). And what can this Hiph. of &#1508;&#1514;&#1514; mean? "To crumble" one's neighbours (Chajg) is an unheard of expression; and the meanings, to throw out crumbs, viz., crumbs of words (Bttcher), or to speak with a broken, subdued voice (Hitzig), are extracted from the rare Arab. fata&#770;fit (fat&#803;afit&#803;), for which the lexicographers note the meaning of a secret, moaning sound. When we see &#1493;&#1492;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1514; standing along with &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498;, then before all we are led to think of &#1508;&#1514;&#1492; [to open], <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-19.htm">Proverbs 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-36.htm">Psalm 73:36</a>. But we stumble at the interrog. &#1492;, which nowhere else appears connected with &#1493;. Ewald therefore purposes to read &#1493;&#1492;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; [and will open wide] (lxx &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;): "that thou usest treachery with thy lips;" but from &#1492;&#1508;&#1514;&#1492;, to make wide open, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-27.htm">Genesis 9:27</a>, "to use treachery" is, only for the flight of imagination, not too wide a distance. On &#1493;&#1492;, et num, one need not stumble; &#1493;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-35.htm">2 Samuel 15:35</a>, shows that the connection of a question by means of &#1493; is not inadmissible; Ewald himself takes notice that in the Arab. the connection of the interrogatives 'a and hal with w and f is quite common;<p>(Note: We use the forms a&#770;wa, a&#770;ba, a&#770;thu&#770;mm, for we suppose the interrogative to the copula; we also say fahad, vid., Mufas&#803;sal, p. 941.)<p>and thus he reaches the explanation: wilt thou befool then by thy lips, i.e., pollute by deceit, by inconsiderate, wanton testimony against others? This is the right explanation, which Ewald hesitates about only from the fact that the interrog. &#1492; comes in between the &#1493; consec. and its perf., a thing which is elsewhere unheard of. But this difficulty is removed by the syntactic observation, that the perf. after interrogatives has often the modal colouring of a conj. or optative, e.g., after the interrog. pronoun, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-7.htm">Genesis 21:7</a>, quis dixerit, and after the interrogative particle, as here and at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/20-9.htm">2 Kings 20:9</a>, iveritne, where it is to be supplied (vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-8.htm">Isaiah 38:8</a>). Thus: et num persuaseris (deceperis) labiis tuis, and shouldest thou practise slander with thy lips, for thou bringest thy neighbour, without need, by thy uncalled for rashness, into disrepute? "It is a question, a&#770;l'nakar (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>), for which 'a (not hal), in the usual Arab. interrogative: how, thou wouldest? one then permits the inquirer to draw the negative answer: "No, I will not do it" (Fleischer). </body></html>
