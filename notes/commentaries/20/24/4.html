And let not a desire ever come into thy mind, Oh that I could shake off restraints! 3-6. Piety and prudence in outward affairs, both go together to complete a wise man. By knowledge the soul is filled with the graces and comforts of the spirit, those precious and pleasant riches. The spirit is strengthened for the spiritual work and the spiritual warfare, by true wisdom. 7-9. A weak man thinks wisdom is too high for him, therefore he will take no pains for it. It is bad to do evil, but worse to devise it. Even the first risings of sin in the heart are sin, and must be repented of. Those that strive to make others hateful, make themselves so. 10. Under troubles we are apt to despair of relief. But be of good courage, and God shall strengthen thy heart. 11,12. If a man know that his neighbour is in danger by any unjust proceeding, he is bound to do all in his power to deliver him. And what is it to suffer immortal souls to perish, when our persuasions and example may be the means of preventing it? 13,14. We are quickened to the study of wisdom by considering both the pleasure and the profit of it. All men relish things that are sweet to the palate; but many have no relish for the things that are sweet to the purified soul, and that make us wise unto salvation. 15,16. The sincere soul falls as a traveller may do, by stumbling at some stone in his path; but gets up, and goes on his way with more care and speed. This is rather to be understood of falls into affliction, than falls into actual sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "house" is figurative of the whole life, the "chambers" of all regions, inward and outward, of it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. by knowledge &#8230; riches&#8212;(Pr 8:18; 21:20).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Knowledge; </span> which in Scripture phrase includes the love and practice of that which we know. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And by knowledge shalt the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.

This may be understood spiritually, of the fulness which the church has from Christ, and of those unsearchable riches of his she receives from him; and of those treasures of wisdom and knowledge, which the chambers of the soul of a believer are filled with by him; and of all the riches put into them, which are both precious and pleasant; such as precious promises, pleasant doctrines, the valuable truths of the Gospel, and blessings of grace. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">shall … be</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">are.</span><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-13.htm">Proverbs 1:13</a> and note <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-10.htm">Proverbs 3:10</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">With all precious and pleasant</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-18.htm">Proverbs 22:18</a>) <span class="cmt_word">riches</span>.
