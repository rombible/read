The two supplements delight in this &#1489;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-29.htm">Deuteronomy 22:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>, 35. The thesis 23b is now confirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-24.htm">Proverbs 24:24</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-25.htm">Proverbs 24:25</a>, from the consequences of this partiality and its opposite: He that saith (&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, with Mehuppach Legarmeh from the last syllable, as rightly by Athias, Nissel, and Michaelis, vid., Thorath Emeth, p. 32) to the guilty: thou art right, i.e., he who sets the guilty free (for &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; and &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; have here the forensic sense of the post-bibl. &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489; and &#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;), him they curse, etc.; cf. the shorter proverb, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a>, according to which a partial, unjust judge is an abomination to God. Regarding &#1504;&#1511;&#1489; (&#1511;&#1489;&#1489;) here and at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26</a>, Schultens, under <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>, is right; the word signifies figere, and hence to distinguish and make prominent by distinguishing as well as by branding; cf. defigere, to curse, properly, to pierce through. Regarding &#1494;&#1506;&#1501;, vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-14.htm">Proverbs 22:14</a>. &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1506;&#1502;&#1501; and &#1500;&#1488;&#1501;, which both mean to bind and combine) are plur. of categ.: not merely individuals, not merely families, curse such an unrighteous judge and abhor him, but the whole people in all conditions and ranks of society; for even though such an unjust judge bring himself and his favourites to external honour, yet among no people is conscience so blunted, that he who absolves the crime and ennobles the miscarriage of justice shall escape the vox populi. On the contrary, it goes well (&#1497;&#1504;&#1506;&#1501;, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17</a>, but here with neut. indef. subj. as &#1497;&#1497;&#1496;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-13.htm">Genesis 12:13</a>, and frequently) with those who place the right, and particularly the wrong, fully to view; &#1502;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1495; is he who mediates the right, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-33.htm">Job 9:33</a>, and particularly who proves, censures, punishes the wrong, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a>, and in the character of a judge as here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-21.htm">Isaiah 29:21</a>. The genitive connection &#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; is not altogether of the same signification as &#1497;&#1497;&#1503; &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, wine of a good sort, Sol 7:10, and &#1488;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;, a woman of a bad kind, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24</a>, for every blessing is of a good kind; the gen. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; thus, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/21-4.htm">Psalm 21:4</a>, denotes the contents of the blessing; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, "with all spiritual blessings," in which the manifoldness of the blessing is presupposed. </body></html>
