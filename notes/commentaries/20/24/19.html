Because of their outward prosperity and worldly happiness, any more than rejoice at their adversity; neither do the one nor the other; where the one prevails, the other does also; by the frequent repetition of this advice, it looks as if this evil is what good men are prone to, and which was very common in Solomon's time, and in the time of his father David, from whom he seems to have borrowed these words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-17.htm">Proverbs 23:17</a>; <p>neither be thou envious at the wicked; though they may stand when thou fallest, or be in prosperity when thou art in adversity; the reasons follow. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious at the wicked:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>.

Ver. 1 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a>). The verb (<span class="accented">charah</span>) means "to burn," "to be angry;" so here we may render, "Be not enraged on account of evil doers." The anger would arise on account of the apparent inequitable distribution of blessings. St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Ne contendas cum pessimis</span>; Septuagint, "Rejoice not over (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>) evildoers." <span class="cmt_word">Neither be thou envious at the wicked;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. do not fancy that their prosperity is to be desired, nor be led to imitate their doings in order to secure like success. The new verse shows the solemn reason for this warning. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The proverb now following stands in no obvious relation with the preceding. But in both a commencement is made with two lines, which contain, in the former, the principal thought; in this here, its reason:<p>13 My son, eat honey, for it is good,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And honeycomb is sweet to thy taste.<p>14 So apprehend wisdom for thy soul;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When thou hast found it, there is a future,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy hope is not destroyed.<p>After its nearest fundamental thought, &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, Arab. t&#803;ejjib, means that which smells and tastes well; honey (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, to be thick, consistent) has, besides, according to the old idea (e.g., in the Koran), healing virtue, as in general bitterness is viewed as a property of the poisonous, and sweetness that of the wholesome. &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1493; is second accus. dependent on &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;, for honey and honeycomb were then spoken of as different; &#1504;&#1508;&#1514; (from &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;, to pour, to flow out) is the purest honey (virgin-honey), flowing of itself out of the comb. With right the accentuation takes 13b as independent, the substantival clause containing the reason, "for it is good:" honeycomb is sweet to thy taste, i.e., applying itself to it with the impression of sweetness; &#1506;&#1500;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-5.htm">Nehemiah 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-6.htm">Psalm 16:6</a> (Hitzig).<p>In the &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; of 14a, it is manifest that <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-13.htm">Proverbs 24:13</a> is not spoken for its own sake. To apprehend wisdom, is elsewhere equivalent to, to receive it into the mind, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a> (cf. &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>, and frequently), according to which Bttcher also here explains: learn to understand wisdom. But &#1499;&#1503; unfolds itself in 14bc: even as honey has for the body, so wisdom has for the soul, beneficent wholesome effects. &#1491;&#1506;&#1492; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is thus not absolute, but is meant in relation to these effects. Rightly Fleischer: talem reputa; Ewald: sic (talem) scito spaientiam (esse) animae tuae, know, recognise wisdom as something advantageous to thy soul, and worthy of commendation. Incorrectly Hitzig explains &#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514;, "if the opportunity presents itself." Apart from this, that in such a case the words would rather have been &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1514;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;, to find wisdom is always equivalent to, to obtain it, to make it one's own, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-9.htm">Proverbs 8:9</a>. &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;<p>(Note: Write &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; with Illuj after the preceding Legarmeh, like 12b, &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; (Thorath Emeth, p. 28).)<p>stands for &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, after the form &#1512;&#1491;&#1492;; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1492; (after Bttcher, 396, not without the influence of the following commencing sound), cf. the similar transitions of a&#772; into e&#780; placed together at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-4.htm">Psalm 20:4</a>; the form &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is also found, but &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is the form in the Cod. Hilleli,<p>(Note: Vid., Strack's Prolegomena critica in V.T. (1872), p. 19.)<p>as confirmed by Moses Kimchi in Comm., and by David Kimchi, Michlol 101b. With &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; begins the apodosis (lxx, Jerome, Targ., Luther, Rashi, Ewald, and others). In itself, &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-6.htm">Genesis 47:6</a>) might also continue the conditional clause; but the explanation, si inveneris (eam) et ad postremum ventum erit (Fleischer, Bertheau, Zckler), has this against it, that &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; does not mean: the end comes, but: there is an end, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-18.htm">Proverbs 23:18</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-18.htm">Proverbs 19:18</a>; here: there is an end for thee, viz., an issue that is a blessed reward. The promise is the same as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-18.htm">Proverbs 23:18</a>. In our own language we speak of the hope of one being cut off; (Arab.) jaz'a, to be cut off, is equivalent to, to give oneself up to despair. </body></html>
