The pleasure we are apt to take in the troubles of an enemy is forbidden. 19,20. Envy not the wicked their prosperity; be sure there is no true happiness in it. 21,22. The godly in the land, will be quiet in the land. There may be cause to change for the better, but have nothing to do with them that are given change. 23-26. The wisdom God giveth, renders a man fit for his station. Every one who finds the benefit of the right answer, will be attached to him that gave it. 27.

The ground and occasion of being enraged, and on the other side, of jealousy or envy, is the prosperity of the godless, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-3.htm">Psalm 73:3</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>. This anger at the apparently unrighteous division of fortune, this jealousy at the success in which the godless rejoice, rest on short-sightedness, which regards the present, and looks not on to the end. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, merely as in the expression '&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;, 14b (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-37.htm">Psalm 37:37</a>), always denotes the happy, glorious issue indemnifying for past sufferings. Such an issue the wicked man has not; his light burns brightly on this side, but one day it is extinguished. In 20b is repeated <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a>. </body></html>
