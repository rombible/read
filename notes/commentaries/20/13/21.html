The rule by which the wise regulate their conduct, is a fountain yielding life and happiness. 15. The way of sinners is hard upon others, and hard to the sinner himself. The service of sin is slavery; the road to hell is strewed with the thorns and thistles that followed the curse. 16. It is folly to talk of things of which we know nothing, and to undertake what we are no way fit for. 17. Those that are wicked, and false to Christ and to the souls of men, do mischief, and fall into mischief; but those that are faithful, find sound words healing to others and to themselves. 18. He that scorns to be taught, will certainly be brought down. 19. There are in man strong desires after happiness; but never let those expect any thing truly sweet to their souls, who will not be persuaded to leave their sins. 20. Multitudes are brought to ruin by bad company. And all that make themselves wicked will be destroyed. 21. When God pursues sinners he is sure to overtake them; and he will reward the righteous. 22. The servant of God who is not anxious about riches, takes the best method of providing for his children. 23. The poor, yet industrious, thrive, though in a homely manner, while those who have great riches are often brought to poverty for want of judgment. 24. He acts as if he hated his child, who, by false indulgence, permits sinful habits to gather strength, which will bring sorrow here, and misery hereafter. 25. It is the misery of the wicked, that even their sensual appetites are always craving. The righteous feeds on the word and ordinances, to the satisfying of his soul with the promises of the gospel, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Bread of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The connection is somewhat obscure.

They pursue the evil of sin, and the evil of punishment pursues them, and at last overtakes them; their damnation, though it may seem to slumber and linger, it does not; it is upon the full speed after them, and will quickly seize upon them. Some understand this of the evil of sin in the conscience, which pursues the sinner, and fills him with terror; <p>but to the righteous good shall be repaid; or, "he shall recompense the righteous with good" (u), or "good to the righteous"; that is, God shall do it; for all the good things they have done, from a right principle, and to a right end; which good works of theirs will pursue and follow them; and for all the ill things they have suffered for righteousness's sake, a reward of grace, though not of debt, will be given them; as they have had their evil things here, they shall have their good things hereafter; as well as are often recompensed in this life, either in themselves or in their posterity, as follows. <p>(u)    "et justis reddet bonum", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus, Gejerus; "justes remunerabit Deus bono", Michaelis; "justis autem bonum rependet", Tigurine version, Piscator, so Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Evil pursueth sinners.</span> Sinners suffer not only the natural consequences of crime in external evil, injury to body, estate, reputation, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>), but also stings of conscience and remorse; even seeming prosperity is often a chastisement, and long impunity is only augmenting the coming retribution.

Regarding &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;, vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a> : it is not used here, as there, impersonally, but has a personal subject: he brings forth, causes. Fine culture, which shows men how to take the right side and in all circumstances to strike the right key, exercises a kindly heart-winning influence, not merely, as would be expressed by &#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488; &#1495;&#1503;, to the benefit of its possessor, but, as is expressed by &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; &#1495;&#1503;, such as removes generally a partition wall and brings men closer to one another. The &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; [perennis], touching it both for the eye and the ear, forms the contrast to &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; &#1495;&#1503;. This word, an elative formation from &#1497;&#1514;&#1503;  equals  Arab. wtn, denotes that which stretches itself far, and that with reference to time: that which remains the same during the course of time. "That which does not change in time, continuing the same, according to its nature, strong, firm, and thus &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; becomes the designation of the enduring and the solid, whose quality remains always the same." Thus Orelli, Die hebr. Synonyme der Zeit u. Ewigkeit, 1871. But that in the passage before us it denotes the way of the &#1489;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; as "endlessly going forward," the explanation of Orelli, after Bttcher (Collectanea, p. 135), is withdrawn by the latter in the new Aehrenlese (where he reads &#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, "constant strife"). And &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>) does not mean "a brook, the existence of which is not dependent on the weather and the season of the year," at least not in accordance with the traditional meaning which is given Sota ix. 5 (cf. the Gemara), but a stony valley; for the Mishna says: &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; &#1499;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493; &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, i.e., &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is here, according to its verbal meaning, equivalent to &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (hard). We are of the opinion that here, in the midst of the discussion of the law of the &#1506;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492; &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1508;&#1492; (the ritual for the atonement of a murder perpetrated by an unknown hand), the same meaning of the &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is certified which is to be adopted in the passage before us. Maimuni<p>(Note:  equals  R. Moses b. Maimum  equals  Rambam, so called by the Jews from the initial letters of his name  equals  Maimonides, d. 1204.)<p>(in Sota and Hilchoth Rozeach ix. 2) indeed, with the Mishna and Gemara, thinks the meaning of a "strong rushing wdy" to be compatible; but &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is a word which more naturally denotes the property of the ground than of a river, and the description, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a> : in a &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, in which there is no tillage and sowing, demands for &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; here the idea of the valley, and not primarily that of the valley-brook. According to this tradition, the Targum places a &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1508;&#1488; in the Peshito translation of 15b, and the Venet. translates, after Kimchi, &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; (of &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2; from &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;. The fundamental idea of remaining like itself, continuing, passes over into the idea of the firm, the hard, so that &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is a word that interchanges with &#1505;&#1500;&#1506;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-21.htm">Numbers 24:21</a>, and serves as a figurative designation of the rocky mountains, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>, and the rocky framework of the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>. Thus the meaning of hardness (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-5.htm">Matthew 13:5</a>) connects itself with the word, and at the same time, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>, of the uncultivable and the uncultivated. The way of the &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, the treacherous, i.e., the manner in which they transact with men, is stiff, as hard as stone, and repulsive; they follow selfish views, never placing themselves in sympathy with the condition of their neighbour; they are without the tenderness which is connected with fine culture; they remain destitute of feeling in things which, as we say, would soften a stone. It is unnecessary to give a catalogue of the different meanings of this &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;, such as vorago (Jerome), a standing bog (Umbreit), and ever trodden way (Bertheau), etc.; Schultens offers, as frequently, the relatively best: at via perfidorum pertinacissime tensum; but &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; does not mean to strain, but to extend. The lxx has between 15a and 15b the interpolation: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;. </body></html>
