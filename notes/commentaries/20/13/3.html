He that thinks before he speaks, that suppresses evil if he have thought it, keeps his soul from a great deal both of guilt and grief. Many a one is ruined by an ungoverned tongue. 4. The slothful desire the gains the diligent get, but hate the pains the diligent take; therefore they have nothing. This is especially true as to the soul. 5. Where sin reigns, the man is loathsome.

The Vulgate paraphrases, "He who is inconsiderate in speech shall experience evils;" Septuagint, "will terrify himself" - will occasion to himself many terrible alarms and inflictions. Hence the psalmist prays, "Set a watch, O Lord, before my month; keep the door of my lips." So we have in the Danish, "A silent man's words are not brought into court;" and in the Spanish, "Let not the tongue say what the head shall pay for;" while the Italians tell us, "The sheep that bleats is strangled by the wolf:" and "Silence was never written down" (Kelly).

But the rhyme is thereby lost. As &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a>, so also may &#1500;&#1489; be used as fem., for one thereby thinks on &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;; the plur. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (&#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;), according to which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-30.htm">Ezekiel 16:30</a> we find the sing. &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, may also conform to this.

Who has not in himself had this experience, how such a word of friendly encouragement from a sympathizing heart cheers the sorrowful soul, and, if only for a time, changes its sorrow into the joy of confidence and of hope! </body></html>
