The rule by which the wise regulate their conduct, is a fountain yielding life and happiness. 15. The way of sinners is hard upon others, and hard to the sinner himself. The service of sin is slavery; the road to hell is strewed with the thorns and thistles that followed the curse. 16. It is folly to talk of things of which we know nothing, and to undertake what we are no way fit for. 17. Those that are wicked, and false to Christ and to the souls of men, do mischief, and fall into mischief; but those that are faithful, find sound words healing to others and to themselves. 18. He that scorns to be taught, will certainly be brought down. 19. There are in man strong desires after happiness; but never let those expect any thing truly sweet to their souls, who will not be persuaded to leave their sins. 20. Multitudes are brought to ruin by bad company. And all that make themselves wicked will be destroyed. 21. When God pursues sinners he is sure to overtake them; and he will reward the righteous. 22. The servant of God who is not anxious about riches, takes the best method of providing for his children. 23. The poor, yet industrious, thrive, though in a homely manner, while those who have great riches are often brought to poverty for want of judgment. 24. He acts as if he hated his child, who, by false indulgence, permits sinful habits to gather strength, which will bring sorrow here, and misery hereafter. 25. It is the misery of the wicked, that even their sensual appetites are always craving. The righteous feeds on the word and ordinances, to the satisfying of his soul with the promises of the gospel, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Bread of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The contrast is the ever recurring one between honest poverty and dishonest wealth.

The comparative temporal prosperity of the righteous and wicked, rather than contentment and discontent, is noted.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> God’s favour and blessing gives the righteous man a competent estate, and a heart to use it, and comfort and satisfaction in it; whereas wicked men commonly want either all these blessings, or some of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul,.... He is blessed with a sufficient competency to live upon; and he is contented with what he has, and uses it moderately; he has enough to eat, and is contented with his portion, and eats no more than sufficeth; he eats to the satisfying of his appetite, and no more; he does not indulge to luxury and excess: and so as to spiritual things; he eats to the satisfying of his soul, with the goodness and fatness of God's house, with the word and ordinances, with the promises of the Gospel, and with Jesus Christ, the bread of life; with these he is satisfied, as with marrow and fatness; <p>but the belly of the wicked shall want; not only spiritual food, which he has no appetite for, but corporeal food; he shall starve in the midst of plenty, not having a heart to put that food into his mouth, and fill his belly with it, as nature requires, through his covetousness; or, having spent his substance in rioting and wantonness, wants bread to satisfy the craving of his appetite. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-3.htm">Proverbs 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>). The good man has always enough to satisfy his wants, because he is temperate, and his substance has the blessing of God. "The chief thing for life," says Siracides (Ecclus. 29:21), "is water, and bread, and clothing, and a house to cover shame." <span class="cmt_word">The belly of the wicked shall want.</span> The wicked are punished by penury and desires never satisfied.

The Niph. &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; denotes not the passing into a state of being, but the being carried out into historical reality, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-12.htm">Ezekiel 21:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-8.htm">Ezekiel 39:8</a>, where it is connected with &#1489;&#1488;&#1492;; it is always the expression of the completed fact to which there is a looking back, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-3.htm">Judges 20:3</a>; and this sense of the Niph. stands so fast, that it even means to be done, finished (brought to an end), to be out, to be done with anything, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>.<p>(Note: We have said, p. 156, that a Niph. in which the peculiar causative meaning of the Hiph. would be rendered passively is without example; we must here with &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; add, that the Niph. of intransitive verbs denotes the entrance into the condition expressed by the Kal, and may certainly be regarded, according to our way of thinking, as passive of the Hiphil (Gesen. 51, 2). But the old language shows no &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; to which &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; (Arab. a&#770;inhaway, in Mutenebbi) stood as passive; in the Arab. also the seventh form, rightly regarded, is always formed from the first, vid., Fleischer's Beitrge, u.s.w., in the Sitzungs-Bericht. d. Schs. Gesellschaft d. Wiss. 1863, p. 172f.)<p>The sentence, that fulfilled desire does good to the soul, appears commonplace (Hitzig); but it is comprehensive enough on the ground of <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a> to cheer even a dying person, and conceals the ethically significant truth that the blessedness of vision is measured by the degree of the longing of faith. But the application of the clause in its pairing with 19b acquires another aspect. On this account, because the desire of the soul is pleasant in its fulfilment, fools abhor the renouncing of evil, for their desire is directed to that which is morally worthless and blameworthy, and the endeavour, which they closely and constantly adhere to, is to reach the attainment of this desire. This subordinate proposition of the conclusion is unexpressed. The pairing of the two lines of the proverb may have been occasioned by the resemblance in sound of &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1514; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;. &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is n. actionis, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-17.htm">Proverbs 16:17</a>, cf. 6. Besides, it in to be observed that the proverb speaks of fools and not of the godless. Folly is that which causes that men do not break free from evil, for it is the deceit of sinful lust which binds them fast thereto. </body></html>
