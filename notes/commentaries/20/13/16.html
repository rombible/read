The rule by which the wise regulate their conduct, is a fountain yielding life and happiness. 15. The way of sinners is hard upon others, and hard to the sinner himself. The service of sin is slavery; the road to hell is strewed with the thorns and thistles that followed the curse. 16. It is folly to talk of things of which we know nothing, and to undertake what we are no way fit for. 17. Those that are wicked, and false to Christ and to the souls of men, do mischief, and fall into mischief; but those that are faithful, find sound words healing to others and to themselves. 18. He that scorns to be taught, will certainly be brought down. 19. There are in man strong desires after happiness; but never let those expect any thing truly sweet to their souls, who will not be persuaded to leave their sins. 20. Multitudes are brought to ruin by bad company. And all that make themselves wicked will be destroyed. 21. When God pursues sinners he is sure to overtake them; and he will reward the righteous. 22. The servant of God who is not anxious about riches, takes the best method of providing for his children. 23. The poor, yet industrious, thrive, though in a homely manner, while those who have great riches are often brought to poverty for want of judgment. 24. He acts as if he hated his child, who, by false indulgence, permits sinful habits to gather strength, which will bring sorrow here, and misery hereafter. 25. It is the misery of the wicked, that even their sensual appetites are always craving. The righteous feeds on the word and ordinances, to the satisfying of his soul with the promises of the gospel, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Bread of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hard - The primary meaning of the original word is permanence (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>).

Of &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;  equals  there is, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-24.htm">Proverbs 10:24</a>. Bertheau's "one causes" is not exact, for "one" [man] is the most general personal subject, but &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is in such cases to be regarded as impersonal: by pride is always a something which causes nothing but quarrel and strife, for the root of pride is egoism. Line second is a variant to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>. Bescheidenheit (modesty) is in our old [German] language exactly equivalent to Klugheit (prudence). But here the &#1510;&#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; are more exactly designated as permitting themselves to be advised; the elsewhere reciprocal &#1504;&#1493;&#1506;&#1509; has here once a tolerative signification, although the reciprocal is also allowable: with such as reciprocally advise themselves, and thus without positiveness supplement each his own knowledge by means of that of another. Most interpreters regard 10b as a substantival clause, but why should not &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; be carried forward? With such as permit themselves to be advised, or are not too proud to sustain with others the relation of giving and receiving, there is wisdom, since instead of hatred comes wisdom - the peaceful fruit resulting from an interchange of views. </body></html>
