An honest desire to do right, preserves a man from fatal mistakes, better than a thousand fine-drawn distinctions. 7. Some who are really poor, trade and spend as if they were rich: this is sin, and will be shame, and it will end accordingly. Some that are really rich, would be thought to be poor: in this there is want of gratitude to God, want of justice and charity to others. There are many hypocrites, empty of grace, who will not be convinced of their poverty. There are many fearing Christians, who are spiritually rich, yet think themselves poor; by their doubts, and complaints, and griefs, they make themselves poor. 8. Great riches often tempt to violence against those that possess them; but the poor are free from such perils. 9. The light of the righteous is as that of the sun, which may be eclipsed and clouded, but will continue: the Spirit is their Light, he gives a fulness of joy: that of the wicked is as a lamp of their own kindling, easily put out. 10. All contentions, whether between private persons, families, churches, or nations, are begun and carried forward by pride. Disputes would be easily prevented or ended, if it were not for pride. 11. Wealth gotten by dishonesty or vice, has a secret curse, which will speedily waste it. 12. The delay of what is anxiously hoped for, is very painful to the mind; obtaining it is very pleasant. But spiritual blessings are chiefly intended.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When the desire cometh - The desire comes, it is a tree of life: i. e., the object of our desires is attained.

That is, the object hoped for; if it is not enjoyed so soon as expected, at least if it is delayed any length of time, the mind becomes uneasy, the heart sinks and fails, and the man is dispirited and ready to despond, and give up all hope of enjoying the desired blessing; whether it be deliverance from any evil, or the possession of any good; <p>but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life; when that which is hoped and wished for, and has been long expected and desired, comes; when there is an accomplishment of men's wishes, it is as grateful to him as the tree of life was in Eden's garden; it gives him an unspeakable pleasure and delight. This may be applied to many things in a spiritual way, as to the first coming of Christ; and some have thought this is greatly regarded and chiefly intended; this was the object of the hope of Old Testament saints; and it was hoped for on a good foundation, on the promise of God, which was frequently repeated, enlarged, and confirmed; yet this promised and hoped for blessing was deferred a long time; from the first promise of it to its accomplishment were four thousand years; though not deferred longer than the appointed time, yet longer than the saints expected, and which sometimes made their hearts sick; they became weak and feeble, fearful and dispirited, lest it should never come to pass, which occasioned fresh promises and assurances to them; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-3.htm">Isaiah 35:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>; but when "the desire" came, Christ the desired object; and who is desirable for the excellencies of his person, his mediatorial qualifications, the work of redemption and salvation he came about, and the blessings he brought with him; and who is the "desire of all nations" that was to come, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>; it was exceeding joyful and delightful to all that expected him, and were looking for redemption in Israel, or Christ; "the coming desire" (i), as it may be rendered, is "a tree of life", or "lives", the author of life, natural, spiritual, and eternal; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>. It may be applied also to the spiritual presence of Christ, and communion with him; this is what believers, being sometimes without, hope and wait for; and sometimes it is deferred a long time, at least they think it so, which makes them very uneasy, and even sick of love, as the church was, Sol 5:8; but when what they so earnestly desire is granted them, it is as if they were in Eden's garden, or rather in the paradise above, plucking the fruit of the tree of life: likewise it may be applied to eternal glory and happiness; this is the object of hope in the present state; it is sometimes impatiently expected and desired, and the language of the soul is, "Why is his chariot so long in coming?", "come, Lord Jesus, come quickly", <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>; and when this desired happiness is enjoyed, how sweet will it be! and the sweeter for having been so much longed and wished for; and when the saints will be in the paradise of God, and eat of the tree of life in the midst of it, and never hunger more. <p>(i)  "desiderium venieus", V.

Many refer this sentence to the impatient longing for heaven which holy men feel, such as we may read in 'De Imitatione,' 3:48, 49, and in the hymns, "For thee, O dear, dear country;" and "We've no abiding city," etc.  And St. Paul can exclaim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-24.htm">Romans 7:24</a>), "O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>). Septuagint, "Better is he who taketh in hand to aid with all his heart, than he who promises and raises hopes" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When the desire cometh</span> - when the object of the longing is obtained - <span class="cmt_word">it is a tree of life</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>); there are then no longer languor and despondence, but strength and refreshment and vigorous action.

As there, &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; and &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; are meant of a twofold inner relation to God, which consists of a ruling influence over man's conduct and a determination of his walk. But instead of naming the persons of the &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; and &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; as the objects of this influence, the proverb uses the abstract expression, but with personal reference, &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; and &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; dna &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, and designates in two words the connection of this twofold character with the principles of their conduct. What is meant by &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; proceeds from the contrasted relationship of the two (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-12.htm">Proverbs 22:12</a>). &#1504;&#1510;&#1512; signifies observare, which is not suitable here, but also tueri (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;), to which &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507; (vid., at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a>, and in Gesen. Thesaurus), not so much in the sense of "to turn upside down," pervertere (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-8.htm">Proverbs 23:8</a>), as in the sense of "to overthrow," evertere (as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-12.htm">Proverbs 21:12</a>), forms a fitting contrast. He who walks forth with an unfeigned and untroubled pure mind stands under the shield and the protection of righteousness (cf. with this prosopopoeia <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-21.htm">Psalm 25:21</a>), from which such a walk proceeds, and at the same time under the protection of God, to whom righteousness appertains, is well-pleasing. but he who in his conduct permits himself to be determined by sin, godlessness (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-8.htm">Zechariah 5:8</a>) from which such a love for sin springs forth, brings to destruction; in other words: God, from whom the &#1512;&#1513;&#1506;, those of a perverse disposition, tear themselves away, makes the sin their snare by virtue of the inner connection established by Him between the &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1492; and the destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-17.htm">Isaiah 9:17</a>). In the lxx this 6th verse was originally wanting; the translation in the version of Aquila, in the Complut. and elsewhere, which the Syr. follows, falsely makes &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1514; the subj.: &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. </body></html>
