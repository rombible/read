The rule by which the wise regulate their conduct, is a fountain yielding life and happiness. 15. The way of sinners is hard upon others, and hard to the sinner himself. The service of sin is slavery; the road to hell is strewed with the thorns and thistles that followed the curse. 16. It is folly to talk of things of which we know nothing, and to undertake what we are no way fit for. 17. Those that are wicked, and false to Christ and to the souls of men, do mischief, and fall into mischief; but those that are faithful, find sound words healing to others and to themselves. 18. He that scorns to be taught, will certainly be brought down. 19. There are in man strong desires after happiness; but never let those expect any thing truly sweet to their souls, who will not be persuaded to leave their sins. 20. Multitudes are brought to ruin by bad company. And all that make themselves wicked will be destroyed. 21. When God pursues sinners he is sure to overtake them; and he will reward the righteous. 22. The servant of God who is not anxious about riches, takes the best method of providing for his children. 23. The poor, yet industrious, thrive, though in a homely manner, while those who have great riches are often brought to poverty for want of judgment. 24. He acts as if he hated his child, who, by false indulgence, permits sinful habits to gather strength, which will bring sorrow here, and misery hereafter. 25. It is the misery of the wicked, that even their sensual appetites are always craving. The righteous feeds on the word and ordinances, to the satisfying of his soul with the promises of the gospel, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Bread of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hard - The primary meaning of the original word is permanence (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>).

That does not do his errand right, nor deliver his message faithfully; such an one falls from the degree of honour in which he was into disgrace; he loses his master's favour that sent him; he is degraded from his post and office: he falls "by evil", or "into evil" (r); by the evil of sin, into the evil of punishment. So wicked ministers and false teachers, such who transform themselves into the apostles of Christ and into angels of light, who corrupt the word of God, and handle it deceitfully; these shall receive their just condemnation; since they do a deal of mischief to the souls of men, and therefore shall fall into mischief themselves, even into everlasting perdition; <p>but a faithful ambassador is health; or, "an ambassador of truths" (s); one that performs his embassy well and truly, he is salutary, useful, and profitable to himself, and to them that send him: the word for ambassador is translated an "hinge", <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-14.htm">Proverbs 26:14</a>; and he is so called, because upon his negotiations abroad the hinge of political affairs turn at home. An ambassador of Christ, who does his work faithfully, keeps back nothing that is profitable, but declares the whole counsel of God; the sound doctrines he delivers are health to the souls of men; as well as he is approved of God and Christ; and so it turns to his own health and advantage, who will hear one day said unto him, "Well done, good and faithful servant", <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-23.htm">Matthew 25:23</a>. <p>(r) "in malum", V.

The translations: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (lxx), &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; (Symmachus, Quinta),<p>(Note: A fragment of an anonymous translation, so called from the place it holds in Origen's Hexapla.)<p>festinata (Jerome), do not necessarily suppose the phrase &#1502;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;  equals  &#1502;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-21.htm">Proverbs 20:21</a> Ker&#305;&#770;, for wealth which comes &#1502;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500; is obtained in a windy (unsubstantial) manner and as if by storm, of which the proverb holds good: "so gewonnen so zerronnen" ( equals  quickly come, quickly go). &#1502;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500; needs neither to be changed into that unhebraic &#1502;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500; (Hitzig) nor into the cognate &#1502;&#1489;&#1492;&#1500; (Ewald), but yet inferior to &#1502;&#1492;&#1489;&#1500; in the content of its idea.

Hebr. &#1506;&#1500; &#1497;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500; &#1497;&#1491;  equals  &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; &#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, e.g., Schabbath 156a (vid., Aruch under &#1506;&#1500;) (distinguish from &#1489;&#1497;&#1491;  equals  with thought, intentionally, Berachoth 52b). There is scarcely a word having more significations that &#1497;&#1491;. Connected with &#1506;&#1500;, it means at one time side or place, at another mediation or direction; that which is characteristic here is the omission of the pronoun (&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;).
