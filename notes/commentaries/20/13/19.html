The rule by which the wise regulate their conduct, is a fountain yielding life and happiness. 15. The way of sinners is hard upon others, and hard to the sinner himself. The service of sin is slavery; the road to hell is strewed with the thorns and thistles that followed the curse. 16. It is folly to talk of things of which we know nothing, and to undertake what we are no way fit for. 17. Those that are wicked, and false to Christ and to the souls of men, do mischief, and fall into mischief; but those that are faithful, find sound words healing to others and to themselves. 18. He that scorns to be taught, will certainly be brought down. 19. There are in man strong desires after happiness; but never let those expect any thing truly sweet to their souls, who will not be persuaded to leave their sins. 20. Multitudes are brought to ruin by bad company. And all that make themselves wicked will be destroyed. 21. When God pursues sinners he is sure to overtake them; and he will reward the righteous. 22. The servant of God who is not anxious about riches, takes the best method of providing for his children. 23. The poor, yet industrious, thrive, though in a homely manner, while those who have great riches are often brought to poverty for want of judgment. 24. He acts as if he hated his child, who, by false indulgence, permits sinful habits to gather strength, which will bring sorrow here, and misery hereafter. 25. It is the misery of the wicked, that even their sensual appetites are always craving. The righteous feeds on the word and ordinances, to the satisfying of his soul with the promises of the gospel, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Bread of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The connection is somewhat obscure. Either, "Satisfied desire is pleasant, therefore it is an abomination to fools to depart from the evil on which their minds are set;" or, "Sweet is the satisfaction of desire, yet the wicked will not depart from the evil which makes that satisfaction impossible." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Self-denial, which fools will not endure, is essential to success.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul; </span> the satisfaction of a man’s desires by the enjoyment of the things desired is very acceptable to him; which may be taken either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of the desire of fools, which may be understood out of the next clause. So the sense of the verse is, It is sweet to sinners to indulge and satisfy their desires, which are wholly carnal and sinful, and for that reason they love sin, and hate the thoughts of leaving it, because their desires are wholly and fully set upon it. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Of good desires, or of the desires of wise and good men, as the LXX., and Chaldee, and Syriac, and Arabic interpreters understand it, by the opposition of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">fools</span> in the next clause. So the sense may be this. The desires of good men are set upon what is good, and they rejoice when they attain to it, and are grieved when they fall short of it; but the desires of the wicked are set upon sin, and it is a pleasure to them to commit it, and an abomination to them to be hindered from it. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Of desires in general. Whatsoever men do earnestly desire, the enjoyment of it is very sweet and grateful to them; and therefore sinners rejoice in the pursuit and satisfaction of their sinful lusts, and abhor all restraint and mortification of them. For this is certain and confessed, that many things are understood in these short proverbial speeches which are not expressed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But; </span> or, <span class="ital">and</span>, as this particle properly signifies; or, <span class="ital">therefore</span>, as it is frequently used. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul,.... Whether the desire be after riches and honour, after wisdom and knowledge; or after the best things, the knowledge of God, and communion with him; an interest in Christ, and the blessings of his grace, as pardon, righteousness, &amp;c. and a right and title to eternal glory and happiness, and the enjoyment of that: and how sweet are these things the soul desires, when they are possessed! see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a>; such are "the desires of the godly", as the Septuagint render the word; <p>but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil; they cannot bear the thoughts of parting with their lusts; they are so delightful to them, not knowing anything of the sweetness of the things before mentioned; and which they can never enjoy without departing from sin, to which they are exceedingly averse. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">but</span>] If with R.V. we retain <span class="ital">but</span>, we must understand <span class="ital">desire</span> in the first clause in a good sense, as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-12.htm" title="Hope deferred makes the heart sick: but when the desire comes, it is a tree of life.">Proverbs 13:12</a></span> : q.d. in spite of the sweetness of good desires accomplished, fools will not forsake evil to attain to it. Balaam’s desire, “let me die the death of the righteous” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-10.htm" title="Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!">Numbers 23:10</a>), would have been “sweet to his soul” in its accomplishment, but it was abomination to him to depart from “the wages of unrighteousness.” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm" title="Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;">2 Peter 2:15</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some, however, would understand the first clause as assigning a reason for what is stated in the second: Because the desire accomplished, &c., therefore it is abomination to fools to depart from the evil on which their heart is set.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The desire accomplished</span> (comp. ver. 12). This is usually taken to mean the desire of what is good and honest, when it is fulfilled and realized, is a source of highest joy and comfort to the wise. Septuagint, "The desires of the pious are sweet to the soul." <span class="cmt_word">But it is abomination to fools to depart from evil.</span> The antithesis is not very obvious, but it may be: it is sweet to a good man to obtain his wish; but for a wicked man to leave, to abandon evil to which he clings so fondly, is a detestable alternative. Or the latter clause may mean that the wicked will not give up the evil which makes the satisfaction of their desire impossible. But it is best to take the first clause as a general statement, viz. the satisfaction of desire is pleasant to all men; then the latter member gives a special case and will signify, "For the sake of this pleasure bad men will not give up their evil wishes and plans; they will pursue what they have set their heart upon because they hate the idea of foregoing their evil designs." Septuagint, "The deeds of sinners are far from knowledge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from practical wisdom, prudence, and piety. The Vulgate introduces quite another thought, "Fools abhor those who flee from evil." Compare the passage in Wisd. 2, concerning the sinner's hatred of the good. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13 Whoever despiseth the word is in bonds to it,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he that feareth the commandment is rewarded.<p>The word is thought of as ordering, and thus in the sense of the commandment, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-19.htm">1 Samuel 17:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>. That which is here said is always true where the will of a man has subordinated itself to the authoritative will of a superior, but principally the proverb has in view the word of God, the &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1492; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;. as the expression of the divine will, which (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-3.htm">Proverbs 6:3</a>) appears as the secondary, with the &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, the general record of the divine will. Regarding &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; &#1500; of contemptuous, despiteful opposition, vid., at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-12.htm">Proverbs 11:12</a>. Jol records the prevailing tradition, for he translates: "Whoever despises advice rushes into destruction; whoever holds the commandment in honour is perfect." But that &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; is to be understood neither of perfection nor of peace (lxx and Jerome), but means compensabitur (here not in the sense of punishment, but of reward), we know from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>. The translation also of &#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1500; &#1500;&#1493; by "he rushes into destruction" (lxx &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, which the Syr.-Hexap. repeats; Luther, "he destroys himself;" the Venet. &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788;, periet sibi) fails, for one does not see what should have determined the poet to choose just this word, and, instead of the ambiguous dat. ethicus, not rather to say &#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;. So also this &#1497;&#1495;&#1489;&#1500; is not with Gesenius to be connected with &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;  equals  Arab. khabl, corrumpere, but with &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;  equals  Arab. h&#803;abl, ligare, obligare. Whoever places himself contemptuously against a word which binds him to obedience will nevertheless not be free from that word, but is under pledge until he redeem the pledge by the performance of the obedience refused, or till that higher will enforce payment of the debt withheld by visiting with punishment. Jerome came near the right interpretation: ipse se in futurum obligat; Abulwald refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>; and Parchon, Rashi, and others paraphrase: &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1497;&#1514;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, he is confiscated as by mortgage. Schultens has, with the correct reference of the &#1500;&#1493; not to the contemner, but to the word, well established and illustrated this explanation: he is pledged by the word, Arab. marhwan (rahyn), viz., pigneratus paenae (Livius, xxix. 36). Ewald translates correctly: he is pledged to it; and Hitzig gives the right explanation: "A &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492; [a pledge, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-16.htm">Proverbs 20:16</a>] is handed over to the offended law with the &#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; [the bad conduct] by the despiser himself, which lapses when he has exhausted the forbearance, so that the punishment is inflicted." The lxx has another proverb following <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a> regarding &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; and &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;; the Syr. has adopted it; Jerome has here the proverb of the animae dolosae (vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>). </body></html>
