And next, that no knowledge deserves the name of <span class="ital">understanding </span>but that which disposes us to devote ourselves, in holy obedience, to God; or the knowledge and practice of true religion, and the duties of it: see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm" title="And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-10.htm" title="The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endures for ever.">Psalm 111:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm" title="The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.">Proverbs 1:7</a>. <span class="ital">If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thou dost not profit me, but thyself by thy wisdom.

The ministers of the gospel go forth to invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We must keep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we never can enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the company of wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely to be corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God; it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slight it. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannot force. Thou shalt bear the loss of that which thou scornest: it will add to thy condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The holy - The word in the Hebrew is plural, agreeing, probably, with &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;  'eloh&#305;&#770;ym understood (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-3.htm">Proverbs 30:3</a>).

This shows who the wise men are, and in what true wisdom lies; no man is wise till he fears the Lord, and he that does so is a wise man, at least then he begins to be one; this is the principal part of wisdom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; and is at the first of it; it is the beginning of grace; it is the first act of wisdom, or grace; or which appears as soon as a man is converted and caused to know wisdom in the hidden part; as repentance, faith, and love, quickly show themselves in one act or another, so does the fear of God; for the former are never without the latter; for fear is an awe and reverence of the divine Being, joined with love to him, trust in him, and a desire to serve and worship him in a right manner; no sooner is a man converted, but presently there is in him a fear of offending God, from a principle of love to him; for not a slavish but a filial fear is here intended; <p>and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding: either the knowledge of the Holy Ones, as the three divine Persons in the Godhead, who are so called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-19.htm">Joshua 24:19</a>; the knowledge of God the Father, who is holy in his nature and works; not a mere natural knowledge of him by the light of nature; nor a mere notional knowledge of him by revelation; not a legal knowledge of him as a lawgiver, and an offended Judge; but an evangelical knowledge of him in Christ, as his God and Father; and as the God of all grace in him; so as to have faith and hope in him, access unto him, and communion with him; this is right understanding: so the knowledge of Christ, God's Holy One; a knowledge of him in his person, offices, and grace; an inward knowledge of him, a spiritual acquaintance with him, so as to approve of him, believe in him, and appropriate him to one's self; this is to attain to a good degree of understanding: as likewise the knowledge of the Holy Spirit, the author of sanctification; of his person, and operations of grace; as a convincer and comforter; as a Spirit of illumination and faith, of regeneration and sanctification; and as the Spirit of adoption, and the earnest of glory; this is another branch of spiritual understanding. Moreover, such knowledge which holy men have, and which makes them so; and which holy men of God, moved by the Holy Ghost, have communicated in the sacred Scriptures, of which they are the penmen. The knowledge of holy things may also be meant; of the holy mysteries of religion, of the holy doctrines of the Gospel, which are all according to godliness, and teach men to live in a holy manner: the faith once delivered to the saints is a most holy faith, encourages and promotes holiness of heart and life; as the doctrines of God's everlasting love; eternal election; the unconditionality of the covenant of grace; redemption by Christ; conversion by efficacious grace; justification by Christ's righteousness; pardon by his blood; satisfaction by his sacrifice; and perseverance by his power: and now a knowledge of these things, not notional, but experimental, is understanding indeed; as well as a knowledge of holy and gracious experiences. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The fear of the LORD <i>is</i> the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the Holy One <i>is</i> <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> understanding.</span><p>(i) He shows what true understanding is, to know the will of God in his word which is meant by holy things.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">the beginning of wisdom</span>] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm" title="The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.">Proverbs 1:7</a>, note, where however the Heb. word for “beginning” is different.

But wisdom is justified of her children.">Matthew 11:19</a>), who have already accepted her invitation, and who love her for her reproofs and profit by her instruction (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/9-8.htm" title="Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate you: rebuke a wise man, and he will love you....">Proverbs 9:8-9</a></span>), and of the “scorners” and “wicked,” who hate and defame her (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/9-7.htm" title="He that reproves a scorner gets to himself shame: and he that rebukes a wicked man gets himself a blot....">Proverbs 9:7-8</a></span>), there is the as yet neutral company of the “simple,” to whom Wisdom now resumes her direct appeal. And in doing so she reverts to first principles, and lays down again the essential condition on which alone wisdom can be attained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the holy</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">the Holy One</span>. The word is plural, the plural of excellence or dignity. The parallel between the clauses of the verse is thus preserved. The same word occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-3.htm" title="I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.">Proverbs 30:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-12.htm" title="Ephraim compasses me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet rules with God, and is faithful with the saints.">Hosea 11:12</a> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm" title="Why seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which does so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,">Hebrews 12:1</a>], where it is rendered, as it is here, the Holy One, in R.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The A.V., in its rendering of the phrase, follows the LXX.

Without the fear of God no teaching is of any avail. <span class="cmt_word">The knowledge of the holy is understanding.</span> The word translated "the holy" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, a plural of excellence (see on Proverbs 30:3) like <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, and equivalent to "the Most Holy One," Jehovah, to which it answers in the first hemistich. God is called "Holy, holy, holy" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>), in his threefold nature, and as majestic beyond expression. The only knowledge worth having, and which is of avail for the practical purposes of life, is the knowledge of God (see on Proverbs 2:5). Septuagint, "The counsel of the holy (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is understanding," with the explanatory clause; "for to know the Law is the character of good thought." This occurs again at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a>, though in the Hebrew in neither place. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Now follows the street-sermon of Wisdom inviting to her banquet:<p>4 Who is simple? let him come hither!"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoso wanteth understanding, to him she saith:<p>5 "Come, eat of my bread,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And drink of the wine which I have mingled!<p>6 Cease, ye simple, and live,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And walk straight on in the way of understanding."<p>The question &#1502;&#1497; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; (thus with Munach, not with Makkeph, it is to be written here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-16.htm">Proverbs 9:16</a>; vid., Baer's Torath Emeth, p. 40), quis est imperitus, is, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-12.htm">Psalm 25:12</a>, only a more animated expression for quisquis est. The retiring into the background of the &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; (servants), and the immediate appearance of Wisdom herself, together with the interruption, as was to be expected, of her connected discourses by the &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; &#1500;&#1468;&#1493;, are signs that the pure execution of the allegorical representation is her at an end. Hitzig seeks, by the rejection of <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-4.htm">Proverbs 9:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-5.htm">Proverbs 9:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7-10</a>, to bring in a logical sequence; but these interpolations which he cuts out are yet far more inconceivable than the proverbial discourses in the mouth of Wisdom, abandoning the figure of a banquet, which besides are wholly in the spirit of the author of this book. That Folly invites to her, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-16.htm">Proverbs 9:16</a>, in the same words as are used by Wisdom, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-4.htm">Proverbs 9:4</a>, is not strange; both address themselves to the simple (vid., on &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-4.htm">Proverbs 1:4</a>) and those devoid of understanding (as the youth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-7.htm">Proverbs 7:7</a>), and seek to bring to their side those who are accessible to evil as to good, and do not dully distinguish between them, which the emulating devertat huc of both imports. The fourth verse points partly backwards, and partly forwards; 4a has its introduction in the &#1514;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-3.htm">Proverbs 9:3</a>; on the contrary, 4b is itself the introduction of what follows. The setting forth of the nom. absolutus &#1495;&#1505;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489; is conditioned by the form of 4a; the &#1502;&#1497; (cf. 4a) is continued (in 4b) without its needing to be supplied: excors ( equals  si quis est excors) dicit ei (not dixit, because syntactically subordinating itself to the &#1514;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;). It is a nominal clause, whose virtual predicate (the devoid of understanding is thus and thus addressed by her) as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-16.htm">Proverbs 9:16</a>.</body></html>
