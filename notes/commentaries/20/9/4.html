The ministers of the gospel go forth to invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We must keep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we never can enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the company of wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely to be corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God; it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slight it. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannot force.

Into Wisdom's house, so well built and furnished; the church of Christ, as a house of instruction; a school, where such who are "simple", weak, and foolish, may learn. Here are many instructors; saints instruct one another; ministers of the word are teachers; yea, Father, Son, and Spirit, here teach and instruct, and none teach like them. Here many lessons are to be learned concerning themselves, concerning Christ, and concerning their duty to God and men; all sorts of persons may learn here, such who know ever so much or ever so little. Or let him turn in here, as into an inn, into which passengers or travellers turn for accommodations; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15</a>. The saints are travellers here, at a distance from their Father's house, and need refreshment by the way; the church of God is an inn of good accommodations; here is room enough to entertain them; here are good lodgings for rest and safety, and good provisions, and all of free cost. And now these are the words of Wisdom, or Christ, either in person, or by his maidens, his ministers, inviting such who are "simple" to turn in hither, and partake of the provisions in it; that is, not such who are quite stupid and insensible, sottish, incorrigible, and irreclaimable; but who are sensible of their folly and simplicity; who are but of weak capacities, apt to be credulous, and so easily imposed upon and deceived; <p>as for him that wanteth understanding; not the natural faculty of the understanding, nor an understanding of things natural and civil; but of things spiritual and evangelical, as of the grace of God; of salvation by Christ; of the work of the Spirit; of themselves and their state; of the Gospel, and the mysteries of it; and who are sensible of their ignorance and want of understanding; which is the first thing the Spirit of God convinces men of; or who are so in comparison of others, are weak in knowledge and experience. Now these Christ does not despise, but invites them into his house for instruction; and where can they be better? and who so fit and proper to be here, and be with Wisdom, than such as these? <p>she saith to him: as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Whoever <i>is</i> <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> simple, let him turn in here: <i>as for</i> him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him,</span><p>(e) He who knows his own ignorance, and is void of malice.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-12.</span> - Here follows the invitation of Wisdom, urging the attendance of guests at the sumptuous banquet which she has prepared (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose is simple, lot him turn in hither.</span> This is a direct address to the imprudent and inexperienced (see on Proverbs 7:7), calling them to turn aside from the way on which they are going, and to come to her. Vulgate, <span class="accented">si quis est parvulus veniat ad me</span>, which reminds one of Christ's tender words, "It is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-14.htm">Matthew 18:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him what follows</span> (so ver. 16). Wisdom's own speech is interrupted, and the writer himself introduces this little clause. She calls on the simple and the unwise, both as necessarily needing her teaching, and not yet inveterate in evil, nor wilfully opposed to better guidance. "The world by wisdom knew not God" and he "hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty, and base things of the world, and things which are despised,  hath God chosen" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21, 26</a>, etc.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; here following &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; is related to it as assigning a motive, like the &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-32.htm">Proverbs 8:32</a>) following &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;; according to the Masora, we have to write &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497; with Mercha, and on the first syllable Gaja (vid., Baer's Torath Emeth, pp. 26, 29; cf. under <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; signifies to watch, not in the sense of ad vigilandum, but vigilando, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a>; Ewald, 380d. In contradistinction to &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; and &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1509;, which denote watching as the consequence of wakefulness or an interruption of sleep, &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1491; signifies watching as a condition, and that as one which a person willingly maintains (Psychol. p. 275), the intentional watching (cf. Arab. shak&#803;idha, to fix penetrating eyes upon anything), with &#1506;&#1500; of the place and object and aim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a>; cf. &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-6.htm">Job 8:6</a>).
