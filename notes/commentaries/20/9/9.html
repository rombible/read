The ministers of the gospel go forth to invite the guests. The call is general, and shuts out none that do not shut out themselves. Our Saviour came, not to call the righteous, but sinners; not the wise in their own eyes, who say they see. We must keep from the company and foolish pleasures of the ungodly, or we never can enjoy the pleasures of a holy life. It is vain to seek the company of wicked men in the hope of doing them good; we are far more likely to be corrupted by them. It is not enough to forsake the foolish, we must join those that walk in wisdom. There is no true wisdom but in the way of religion, no true life but in the end of that way. Here is the happiness of those that embrace it. A man cannot be profitable to God; it is for our own good. Observe the shame and ruin of those who slight it. God is not the Author of sin: and Satan can only tempt, he cannot force. Thou shalt bear the loss of that which thou scornest: it will add to thy condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses seem somewhat to interrupt the continuity of the invitation which Wisdom utters. The order of thought is, however, this: "I speak to you, the simple, the open ones, for you have yet ears to hear: but from the scorner or evil doer, as such, I turn away." The words are illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a> ff. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

In the Hebrew text it is only "give to a wise man"; give him reproof, correction, chastisement, doctrine, or instruction, be it what it will, he will be the better for it. The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, render it, "give occasion"; to him of showing his wisdom and of improving in it: <p>and he will be yet wiser; he will learn something by every him that is given him, whether it be by way of rebuke, or by way of instruction; <p>teach a just man; one that is truly so, that has seen the insufficiency of his own righteousness, and has renounced that, and does not trust in it; and who has learned Christ, as the Lord his righteousness; has seen the glory, fulness, and suitableness of his righteousness, and trusts unto it and depends upon it; and in consequence of this lives soberly, righteously, and godly; teach such a man the doctrines of the Gospel, and every lesson of obedience and duty, <p>and he will increase in learning; he will grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Christ and all divine things; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>.

Vulgate and Septuagint, "Give an opportunity to a wise man, and he will be wiser" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-29.htm">Matthew 25:29</a>). To make the best use of all occasions of learning duty, whether they present themselves in a winning or a forbidden shape, is the part of one who is wise unto salvation (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>, and note there). <span class="cmt_word">Teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</span> Wisdom being a moral and not merely an intellectual, quality. there is a natural interchange of "wise" and "just," referring to the same individual,  in the two clauses. Vulgate, <span class="accented">festinabit accipere</span>; Septuagint, "Instruct a wise man, and he shall have more given him." The wise are thus rewarded with larger measures of wisdom, because they are simple, humble, and willing to learn, having that childlike spirit which Christ commends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The verb &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;, when a feast is spoken of, means to invite; &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a> (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>, etc.), are the guests. &#1504;&#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; the lxx translates &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, but certainly here the disciples are meant who already are in the service of Wisdom; but that those who are invited to Wisdom are thought of as feminine, arises from the tasteful execution of the picture. The invitation goes forth to be known to all far and wide, so that in her servants Wisdom takes her stand in the high places of the city. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-2.htm">Proverbs 8:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-21.htm">Proverbs 1:21</a>, there is used here the expression &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;. We must distinguish the Semitic &#1490;&#1468;&#1507; ( equals  ganf), wings, from &#1490;&#1504;&#1507;  equals  &#1499;&#1504;&#1507;, to cover, and &#1490;&#1468;&#1507; ( equals  gaff or ganf), the bark, which is derived either from &#1490;&#1468;&#1508;&#1507; or &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1507;, Arab. jnf, convexus, incurvus et extrinsecus gibber fuit, hence originally any surface bent outwards or become crooked (cf. the roots cap, caf, &#1511;&#1489; &#1499;&#1507; &#1490;&#1507; &#1490;&#1489;, etc.), here the summit of a height (Fl.); thus not super alis (after the analogy of &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, after Suidas  equals  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), but super dorsis (as in Lat. we say &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and also viae). </body></html>
