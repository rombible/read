Not only, Keep them, and you shall live; but, Keep them as those that cannot live without them. Those that blame strict and careful walking as needless and too precise, consider not that the law is to be kept as the apple of the eye; indeed the law in the heart is the eye of the soul. Let the word of God dwell in us, and so be written where it will be always at hand to be read. Thus we shall be kept from the fatal effects of our own passions, and the snares of Satan.

Nothing has a greater tendency than Christ and his Gospel, and an intimate acquaintance with them, and a retention of them, to keep from all sin, from all fleshly lusts, from the sin of uncleanness; and also from all the errors, heresies, idolatry, superstition, and will worship, of the whore of Rome; a stranger to God and true godliness, to Christ and his truths, the Spirit and his operations; <p>from the stranger which flattereth with her words; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3</a>, and see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">strange woman … stranger</span>] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm" title="To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flatters with her words;">Proverbs 2:16</a>, note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">flattereth with</span>] “Heb. <span class="ital">maketh smooth her words</span>,” R.V. marg.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they may keep thee from the strange woman</span> (see on Proverbs 2:16 and Proverbs 6:24).

Jealousy is not usually &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, the glow of anger (from &#1497;&#1495;&#1501;, as &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;), but &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; (constr. as &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1514;), the glow of a man's anger, who with the putting forth of all his manly strength will seek satisfaction to his wounded honour. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, here significant for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, with the fundamental idea of strength, firmness; cf.

The following &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500; (with the orthophonic Dagesh, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a> &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;, and with Makkeph) is connected with &#1490;&#1489;&#1512;, with definite reference to the man whom the faithless guest has made a cuckold. When the day comes in which the adultery brought to light demands and admits of vengeance, then, wounded in his right and in his honour, he knows no mercy; he pays no regard to any atonement or recompense by which the adulterer seeks to appease him and induce him not to inflict the punishment that is due: he does not consent, even though thou makest ever so great the gift whereby thou thinkest to gain him.
