It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Simple - In the bad sense of the word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a> note); "open" to all impressions of evil, empty-headed and empty-hearted; lounging near the house of ill-repute, not as yet deliberately purposing to sin, but placing himself in the way of it at a time when the pure in heart would seek their home.

A married woman, and an adulteress, as the following account of her shows; as soon as ever she discerned the young man before described, who she knew, by his air, walk, and dress, was a fit person for her turn, she at once set out from her house, or the corner where she stood, and met him; she did not wait till he came up and made his suit to her, but she went out, and first attacked him; wherefore the word "behold" is prefixed as a note of admiration at the impudence of the woman, and as a note of attention to observe the consequence of this affair. This woman represents the woman on a scarlet-coloured beast, the mother of harlots, who, though she pretends to be the spouse of Christ, is an arrant whore, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-3.htm">Revelation 17:3</a>; <p>with the attire of a harlot; not with her face veiled, as Tamar was, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14</a>; for though that might be the sign of a harlot in the daytime, yet not in the night, as this was; rather with showy gaudy garments, such as the Athenian whores wore, or short ones, as the Romans; the word signifies one fitted to her body, neat and well shaped, to recommend her: so the woman, the whore of Rome, is said to be arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls; signifying the outward pomp and splendour of the Romish religion, designed to captivate weak and unwary minds; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>; <p>and subtle of heart; mistress of all artful and intriguing methods to seduce and ensnare (g); or, "reserved of heart" (h), cautious and wary what she said, told everything that was encouraging, but kept back what was discouraging; or she kept her own heart to herself, while she stole the hearts of others; so the Targum renders it, <p>"which takes away the hearts of young men;'' <p>and to the same purpose are the versions of the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic: the subtlety of the popes, priests, jesuits, and other emissaries of Rome, to deceive the hearts of the simple, is well known; the coming of antichrist was after the working of Satan, with all deceivableness of unrighteousness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>. <p>(g) "Fallendique vias mille ministret amor", Tibullus ad Junonem, 6. v. 12.

With the attire of an harlot. There is no "with" in the original, "woman" and "attire" being  in apposition: "There met him a woman, a harlot's dress" (<span class="accented">shith</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-6.htm">Psalm 73:6</a>); her attire catches the eye at once, and identifies her (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-14.htm">Genesis 38:14</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a> the harlot is "arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls;" and in the present case the female is dressed in some conspicuous garments, very different from the sober clothing of the pure and modest.

The versions have used a different reading. Thus the Septuagint: "Who makes the hearts of young men flutter (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">praeparata ad capiendas animas</span>, "ready to catch souls." Vers. 11 and 12 describe the character and habits of this woman, not as she appeared on this occasion, but as she is known to the writer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The subject-matter of this earnest warning are the admonitions of the teacher of wisdom, and through him of Wisdom herself, who in contrast to the world and its lust is the worthiest object of love, and deserves to be loved with the purest, sincerest love:<p>4 Say to wisdom: "Thou art my sister!"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And call understanding "Friend;"<p>5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; From the stranger who useth smooth words.<p>The childlike, sisterly, and friendly relationship serves also to picture forth and designate the intimate confidential relationship to natures and things which are not flesh and blood. If in Arabic the poor is called the brother of poverty, the trustworthy the brother of trustworthiness, and abu, um (&#1488;&#1501;), achu, ucht, are used in manifold ways as the expression for the interchangeable relation between two ideas; so (as also, notwithstanding Ewald, 273b, in many Hebr. proper names) that has there become national, which here, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>, mediated by the connection of the thoughts, only first appears as a poetic venture. The figurative words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-4.htm">Proverbs 7:4</a> not merely lead us to think of wisdom as a personal existence of a higher order, but by this representation it is itself brought so near, that &#1488;&#1501; easily substitutes itself, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3</a>, in the place of &#1488;&#1501;. &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497; of Solomon's address to the bride brought home is in its connection compared with Book of Wisdom 8:2. While the o&#770;th of &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; by no means arises from abstr. u&#770;th, but acho&#770;th is derived from achajath, &#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; (as <a href="http://biblehub.com/ruth/2-1.htm">Ruth 2:1</a>, cf. &#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a>), here by Mugrash &#1502;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;, properly means acquaintance, and then the person known, but not in the superficial sense in which this word and the Arab. ma'arfat are used (e.g., in the Arabic phrase quoted by Fleischer, kanna as&#803;h&#803;aab s&#803;arna m'aaraf - nous tions amis, nous en sommes plus que de simples connaissances), but in the sense of familiar, confidential alliance. The infin. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1498; does not need for its explanation some intermediate thought to be introduced: quod eo conducet tibi ut (Mich.), but connects itself immediately as the purpose: bind wisdom to thyself and thyself to wisdom thus closely that thou mayest therewith guard thyself. As for the rest, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>; this verse repeats itself here with the variation of one word. </body></html>
