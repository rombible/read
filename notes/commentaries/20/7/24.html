Calmet justly observes, that “Solomon had no need to go further than his own family for unhappy examples of the ill effects of lust. He was, indeed, himself, afterward, a sad proof of what he here says. How many lions hath the weakness of woman tamed, who, though mean and miserable herself, makes a prey of the great ones of the earth!” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:6-27 Here is an affecting example of the danger of youthful lusts. It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The first clause does not connect itself very clearly with the foregoing, and is probably affected by the corrupt text which makes it perplexing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

The Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and Arabic versions, read, in the singular number, "my son", in the same manner as the chapter begins; but it is in the plural number in the Hebrew text; and so read the Targum and Syriac version, "children", the children of Solomon; not only those of his own body, but all such that put themselves under his instruction, or were willing to take his advice: it may be extended to all the children of men, for all are interested herein; especially such who profess to be the children of God and of Christ, the followers of wisdom. This is the epilogue, or application of the above story. Since this is the case, that young men are in danger of being ensnared and brought to ruin by this harlot, therefore take the advice of the wisest of men, even of Wisdom herself; <p>and attend to the words of my mouth; the doctrines of Christ; the best preservative from the allurements of the whore of Rome. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">ye children</span>] Rather, <span class="ital">Now, therefore</span>, <span class="bld">my sons</span>, &c., R.V.

There, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14</a>, are found the three names for spicery as here, and one sees that &#1502;&#1512; &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; are not to be connected genitively: there are three things, accented as in the title-verse <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a>. The myrrh, &#1502;&#1512; (Balsamodendron myrrha), belongs, like the frankincense, to the species of the Amyris, which is an exotic in Palestine not less than with us; the aromatic quality in them does not arise from the flowers or leaves, so that Sol 1:13 leads us to think of a bunch of myrrh, but from the resin oozing through the bark (Gummi myrrhae or merely myrrha), consisting of bright glossy red or golden-yellow grains more or less transparent. &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (used by Balaam, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>) is the Semitic Old-Indian name of the alo, agaru or aguru; the aromatic quality is in the wood of the Aquilaria agallocha, especially its root (agallochum or lignum aloes) dried in the earth - in more modern use and commerce the inspissated juice of its leaves. &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; is &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (like &#1502;&#1512;, a Semitic word<p>(Note: Myrrh has its name &#1502;&#1512; from the bitterness of its taste, and &#1511;&#1504;&#1501; appears to be a secondary formation from &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, whence &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, reed; cf. the names of the cinnamon, cannella, Fr. cannelle. Cinnamum (&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) is only a shorter form for cinnamomum. Pliny, Hist. Nat. xii. 19 (42), uses both forms indiscriminately.)<p>that had come to the Greeks through the Phoenicians), the cinnamon, i.e., the inner rind of the Laurus cinnamomum. The myrrh is native to Arabia; the alo, as its name denotes, is Indian; the cinnamon in like manner came through Indian travellers from the east coast of Africa and Ceylon (Taprobane). All these three spices are drugs, i.e., are dry apothecaries' wares; but we are not on that account to conclude that she perfumed (Hitzig) her bed with spices, viz., burnt in a censer, an operation which, according to Sol 3:6, would rather be designated &#1511;&#1496;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. The verb &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; (only here as Kal) signifies to lift oneself up (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-13.htm">Psalm 48:13</a>), and transitively to raise and swing hither and thither ( equals  &#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1507;); here with a double accusative, to besprinkle anything out of a vessel moved hither and thither. According to this sense, we must think of the three aromas as essences in the state of solution; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>. Hitzig's question, "Who would sprinkle bed-sheets with perfumed and thus impure water?" betrays little knowledge of the means by which even at the present day clean linen is made fragrant. The expression &#1512;&#1493;&#1492; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; sounds like &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512; &#1491;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, Sol 5:1, although there &#1491;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is probably the voc., and not, as here, the accus.; &#1512;&#1493;&#1492; is the Kal of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-19.htm">Proverbs 5:19</a>, and signifies to drink something copiously in full draughts. The verbal form &#1506;&#1500;&#1505; for &#1506;&#1500;&#1509; is found besides only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-18.htm">Job 20:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-13.htm">Job 39:13</a>; the Hithpa. signifies to enjoy oneself greatly, perhaps (since the Hithpa. is sometimes used reciprocally, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-25.htm">Genesis 2:25</a>) with the idea of reciprocity (Targ. &#1495;&#1512; &#1500;&#1510;&#1491;). We read boohabim with Chateph-Kametz after Ben-Asher (vid., Kimchi's Lex.); the punctuation &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; is that of Ben-Naphtali. </body></html>
