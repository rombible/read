It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The first clause does not connect itself very clearly with the foregoing, and is probably affected by the corrupt text which makes it perplexing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

Go not astray in her paths. The LXX.

Erroneously Vogel reads &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; after the Targ. instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;. We say in Hebr. &#1488;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493; &#1489;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;, il n'est pas chez soi, as we say &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, il a pris avec soi (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-10.htm">Jeremiah 38:10</a>). &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; Hitzig seeks to connect with the verb, which, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-3.htm">Isaiah 22:3</a>, is possible; for the Hebr. &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; (&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511;), far off, has frequently the meaning from afar, for the measure of length is determined not from the point of departure outward, but from the end, as e.g., Homer, Il. ii. 456; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;, from afar the gleam is seen, i.e., shines hither from the distance. Similarly we say in French, il vient du cot du nord, he comes from the north, as well as il va du cot du nord, he goes northwards. But as we do not say: he has gone on a journey far off, but: on a distant journey, so here &#1502;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511; is virtually an adj. (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26</a>) equivalent to &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1511;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-10.htm">Numbers 9:10</a>): a journey which is distant  equals  such as from it he has a long way back. Michaelis has well remarked here: ut timorem ei penitus adimat, veluti per gradus incedit. He has undertaken a journey to a remote point, but yet more: he has taken money with him, has thus business to detain him; and still further: he has even determined the distant time of his return. &#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507; .nruter (thus to be written after Ben-Asher, vid., Baer's Torath Emeth, p. 41) is the purse (from &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, to bind together), not one of many, but that which is his own. The terminus precedes 20b to emphasize the lateness; vid., on &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1488; under <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-4.htm">Psalm 81:4</a>. Graec. Venet. &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, after Kimchi and others, who derive &#1499;&#1505;&#1488; (&#1499;&#1505;&#1492;) from the root &#1499;&#1505;, to reckon, and regard it as denoting only a definite time. But the two passages require a special idea; and the Syr. k&#803;e&#770;so, which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-32.htm">1 Kings 12:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-10.htm">2 Chronicles 7:10</a>, designates the time from the 15th day of the month, shows that the word denotes not, according to the Talmud, the new moon (or the new year's day), when the moon's disk begins to cover itself, i.e., to fill (&#1497;&#1514;&#1499;&#1505;&#1492;), but the full moon, when it is covered, i.e., filled; so that thus the time of the night-scene here described is not that of the last quarter of the moon (Ewald), in which it rises at midnight, but that of the new moon (Hitzig), when the night is without moonlight. Since the derivation of the word from &#1499;&#1505;&#1488; (&#1499;&#1505;&#1492;), to cover, gives the satisfactory idea of the covering or filling of the moon's disk, we do not seek after any other; Dietrich fixes on the root-idea of roundness, and Hitzig of vision (&#1499;&#1505;&#1488;  equals  &#1505;&#1499;&#1492;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492;, vid., on the contrary, under <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-9.htm">Psalm 143:9</a>). The &#1500; is that of time at which, in which, about which, anything is done; it is more indefinite than &#1489;&#1468; would be. He will not return for some fourteen days. </body></html>
