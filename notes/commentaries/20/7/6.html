It is a history or a parable of the most instructive kind. Will any one dare to venture on temptations that lead to impurity, after Solomon has set before his eyes in so lively and plain a manner, the danger of even going near them? Then is he as the man who would dance on the edge of a lofty rock, when he has just seen another fall headlong from the same place. The misery of self-ruined sinners began in disregard to God's blessed commands. We ought daily to pray that we may be kept from running into temptation, else we invite the enemies of our souls to spread snares for us. Ever avoid the neighbourhood of vice. Beware of sins which are said to be pleasant sins. They are the more dangerous, because they most easily gain the heart, and close it against repentance. Do nothing till thou hast well considered the end of it. Were a man to live as long as Methuselah, and to spend all his days in the highest delights sin can offer, one hour of the anguish and tribulation that must follow, would far outweigh them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Casement - The latticed opening of an Eastern house, overlooking the street (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

This is either an historical account of a matter of fact known to Solomon, or a parable made by him, setting forth the cunning artifices of an harlot, the folly and weakness of a young man ensnared, and the ruin he is brought into by her. As Solomon was a public magistrate, he is here represented as a private observer of the behaviour of his subjects, as sitting in his palace at a window, at the small windows of it, as the Targum, where he could see and not be seen himself; near to which was an harlot's house; for they generally get about the courts of princes, where they make their prey; <p>I looked through my casement; or "lattice" (c); the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions: understand this of the harlot looking out of the window of her house and through the casement, when she spied a young man, as follows; but this agrees not with the Hebrew text, which carries it to Solomon; though a greater than he may be designed, the omniscient God, who looks through the windows and lattice of heaven, and beholds all the actions of the children of men; those that are most private, and done in the dark; and Christ the Son of God, whose "eyes are like unto aflame of fire", to look through all the darkness of Popery, represented by the Thyatirian church state; into all the intrigues of the Romish harlot, and behold all the follies of those that commit fornication with her, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a>. <p>(c)  "per cancellum meum", Montanus; "per cancellos", Tigurine version, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{b}</span> For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</span><p>(b) Solomon uses this parable to declare their folly, who allow themselves to be abused by harlots.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">casement</span>] Or, <span class="bld">lattice</span>, R.V., as the same Heb. word is translated in A.V. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-28.htm" title="The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots?">Jdg 5:28</a>, the only other place in which it occurs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/7-7.htm" title="And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,..."><span class="ital">Proverbs 7:7-9</a></span><span class="bld">.</span> A few graphic strokes draw the picture of the victim.

Jealousy is not usually &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, the glow of anger (from &#1497;&#1495;&#1501;, as &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;), but &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; (constr. as &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1514;), the glow of a man's anger, who with the putting forth of all his manly strength will seek satisfaction to his wounded honour. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, here significant for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, with the fundamental idea of strength, firmness; cf.

The following &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500; (with the orthophonic Dagesh, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a> &#1497;&#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;, and with Makkeph) is connected with &#1490;&#1489;&#1512;, with definite reference to the man whom the faithless guest has made a cuckold. When the day comes in which the adultery brought to light demands and admits of vengeance, then, wounded in his right and in his honour, he knows no mercy; he pays no regard to any atonement or recompense by which the adulterer seeks to appease him and induce him not to inflict the punishment that is due: he does not consent, even though thou makest ever so great the gift whereby thou thinkest to gain him.
