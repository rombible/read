A foolish man is soon angry, and is hasty in expressing it; he is ever in trouble and running into mischief. It is kindness to ourselves to make light of injuries and affronts, instead of making the worst of them. 17. It is good for all to dread and detest the sin of lying, and to be governed by honesty. 18. Whisperings and evil surmises, like a sword, separate those that have been dear to each other. The tongue of the wise is health, making all whole. 19. If truth be spoken, it will hold good; whoever may be disobliged, still it will keep its ground. 20. Deceit and falsehood bring terrors and perplexities. But those who consult the peace and happiness of others have joy in their own minds. 21. If men are sincerely righteous, the righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. But they that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. 22. Make conscience of truth, not only in words, but in actions. 23. Foolish men proclaim to all the folly and emptiness of their minds. 24. Those who will not take pains in an honest calling, living by tricks and dishonesty, are paltry and beggarly. 25. Care, fear, and sorrow, upon the spirits, deprive men of vigour in what is to be done, or courage in what is to be borne. A good word from God, applied by faith, makes the heart glad. 26. The righteous is abundant; though not in this world's goods, yet in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, which are the true riches. Evil men vainly flatter themselves that their ways are not wrong. 27. The slothful man makes no good use of the advantages Providence puts in his way, and has no comfort in them. The substance of a diligent man, though not great, does good to him and his family. He sees that God gives it to him in answer to prayer. 28. The way of religion is a straight, plain way; it is the way of righteousness. There is not only life at the end, but life in the way; all true comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Under tribute - The comparison is probably suggested by the contrast between the condition of a conquered race (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30-33</a>), and that of the freedom of their conquerors from such burdens. The proverb indicates that beyond all political divisions of this nature there lies an ethical law. The "slothful" descend inevitably to pauperism and servitude.

The phrase occurs frequently (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-11.htm" title="And it shall be, if it make you answer of peace, and open to you, then it shall be, that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries to you, and they shall serve you.">Deuteronomy 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-30.htm" title="Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelled among them, and became tributaries.">Jdg 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-33.htm" title="Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelled among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries to them.">Jdg 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-35.htm" title="But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.">Jdg 1:35</a>), and is rendered, “be, or become tributary,” both in A.V. and R.V., though with the alternative, “be subject to task-work,” in R.V. marg. But in all those places the words, “and shall serve thee” are added, showing that it was not in money but in toil, as with the Israelites in Egypt, that the “tribute” was to be paid. Hence the phrase comes to have the meaning which it has here.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-28</span> speak of the means of getting on in life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the diligent shall bear rule</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>).

The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1492; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1488;), peculiar to the Hebr., which in the modern Hebr. generally means "to speak out" (&#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1488; in the grammar: the pronunciation) (according to which the lxx, Syr., and Targ. translate it by &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;), means in biblical Hebr., especially with reference to the binding of oneself by an oath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>), and to solemn protestations (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-7.htm">Numbers 30:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-9.htm">Numbers 30:9</a>, according to which Jerome, promittit): to utter incautiously in words, to speak without thought and at random, referred erroneously by Gesenius to the R. &#1489;&#1496;, to be hollow, probably a word imitative of the sound, like the Greek &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, to stammer, and &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, to babble, which the lexicographers refer to a talkative person of the name of &#x392;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, as our "salbadern" [ equals  to talk foolishly] owes its origin to one Jenaer Bader on the Saal. Theod. and the Graec. Venet. give the false reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1496;&#1495; (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2;). &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; stands loco accusativi, the &#1499;&#1468; being regarded as a noun: (effutiens verba) quae sunt instar confossionum gladii (Fl.). We also call such a man, who bridles his loquacity neither by reflection nor moderates it by indulgent reference to his fellow-men, a Schwertmaul (sword-mouth) or a Schandmaul (a mouth of shame  equals  slanderer), and say that he has a tongue like a sword. But on the other hand, the tongue of the wise, which is in itself pure gentleness and a comfort to others, since, far from wounding, rather, by means of comforting, supporting, directing exhortation, exercises a soothing an calming influence. Regarding &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;, whence &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;, Dietrich in Gesenius' Lex. is right. The root-meaning of the verb &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; (cognate &#1512;&#1508;&#1492;, to be loose, Hiph. to let go, Hithpa. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-9.htm">Proverbs 18:9</a>, to show oneself slothful) is, as the Arab. kindred word rafa&#770;, rafa, raf, rawf (ra&#770;f) shows, that of stilling, softening, soothing, whence arises the meaning of healing (for which the Arab. has t&#803;abb and 'alkh); the meaning to repair, to mend, which the Arab. rafa&#770; and rafa have, does not stand in a prior relation to to heal, as might appear from <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>, but is a specializing of the general idea of reficere lying in mitigare, just as the patcher is called &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  equals  &#x3b7;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;,<p>(Note: Whether &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, explained neither by Curtius nor by Flick, stands in a relation to it, we leave out of view.)<p>from &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, which means equally to still and to heal. Since thus in &#1512;&#1508;&#1488; the meanings of mitigating and of healing are involved, it is plain that &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1488;, as it means healing (the remedy) and at the same time (cf. &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>) the preservation of health, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-22.htm">Proverbs 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>, so also may mean mildness (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-4.htm">Proverbs 15:4</a>), tranquillity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>, calm patience in contrast to violent passion), and refreshing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-17.htm">Proverbs 13:17</a>). Oetinger and Hitzig translate here "medicine;" our translation, "healing (the means of healing)," is not essentially different from it. </body></html>
