A foolish man is soon angry, and is hasty in expressing it; he is ever in trouble and running into mischief. It is kindness to ourselves to make light of injuries and affronts, instead of making the worst of them. 17. It is good for all to dread and detest the sin of lying, and to be governed by honesty. 18. Whisperings and evil surmises, like a sword, separate those that have been dear to each other. The tongue of the wise is health, making all whole. 19. If truth be spoken, it will hold good; whoever may be disobliged, still it will keep its ground. 20. Deceit and falsehood bring terrors and perplexities. But those who consult the peace and happiness of others have joy in their own minds. 21. If men are sincerely righteous, the righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. But they that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. 22. Make conscience of truth, not only in words, but in actions. 23. Foolish men proclaim to all the folly and emptiness of their minds. 24. Those who will not take pains in an honest calling, living by tricks and dishonesty, are paltry and beggarly. 25. Care, fear, and sorrow, upon the spirits, deprive men of vigour in what is to be done, or courage in what is to be borne. A good word from God, applied by faith, makes the heart glad. 26. The righteous is abundant; though not in this world's goods, yet in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, which are the true riches. Evil men vainly flatter themselves that their ways are not wrong. 27. The slothful man makes no good use of the advantages Providence puts in his way, and has no comfort in them. The substance of a diligent man, though not great, does good to him and his family. He sees that God gives it to him in answer to prayer. 28. The way of religion is a straight, plain way; it is the way of righteousness. There is not only life at the end, but life in the way; all true comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "fool" cannot restrain his wrath; it rushes on "presently" (as in the margin, on the same day, however, uselessly.

Having no command of himself, he cannot repress it, nor keep it in; no sooner is he provoked but he shows it in his countenance, and by his words and actions; it is to be seen in the fire of his eyes, in the frowns of his face, in the gnashing of his teeth, and in the stamping of his feet, as well as in the bitter expressions of his mouth: or "a fool's wrath in that day is known" (b); in the same day in which the provocation is given; yea, in the same hour, and in the same moment; he cannot defer showing it for the least space of time; or it is openly known, it is to be seen and observed by everyone: or thus, "a fool is presently known by his wrath" (c); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:9</a>; <p>but a prudent man covereth shame; conceals his anger and resentment at any injury done him by words or actions, which if suffered to break out would bring shame and disgrace to him; or he covers the injury itself, the disgraceful words that are spoken of him, and the shameful actions done unto him; he puts up with the contempt that is cast upon him, and bears it patiently; takes no notice of the offence given him, and much less seeks revenge; in which he acts a prudent part, for by so doing he creates less trouble to himself, and gains more credit and reputation from others. <p>(b) "eo die quo irritatur", Tigurine version; "eodem die", Junius &amp; Tremellius; so Banyus, Merceras, Gejerus.

A foolish man, if he is vexed, insulted, or slighted, has no idea of controlling himself or checking the expression of his aroused feelings; he at once, in the same day on which he has been incensed, makes his vexation known. <span class="cmt_word">A prudent man covereth</span> - concealeth - <span class="cmt_word">shame</span>; takes no notice of an affront at the moment, knowing that by resenting it he will only make matters worse, and that it is best to let passions cool before he tries to set the matter right (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-22.htm">Proverbs 20:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-29.htm">Proverbs 24:29</a>). Christ's injunction goes far beyond this maxim of worldly prudence: "I say unto you that ye resist not evil;" "Unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek, offer also the other" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-29.htm">Luke 6:29</a>); and it is certain that these maxims might be carried into practice much more than they are, even in the present state of society. Septuagint, "A clever man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented">callidus</span>, Vulgate) concealeth his own disgrace." Corn. a Lapide quotes a Hebrew proverb which asserts that a man's character is accurately discerned "by purse, by cup, by anger;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by his conduct in money transactions, under the influence of wine, and in the excitement of anger. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>10 The righteous knows how his cattle feel,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the compassion of the godless is cruel.<p>The explanation: the righteous taketh care for the life of his beast (Fl.), fails, for 10a is to be taken with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a>; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; signifies also the state of one's soul, the frame of mind, the state of feeling; but &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; has, as in the related proverb, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a>, the meaning of careful cognizance or investigation, in conformity with which one acts. If the Tor includes in the law of the Sabbath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>) useful beasts and cattle, which are here especially meant, and secures to them the reward of their labour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>); if it forbids the mutilation, and generally the giving of unnecessary pain, to beasts; if it enjoins those who take a bird's nest to let the dam escape (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>.) - these are the prefigurations of that &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513; &#1489;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, and as the God of the Tor thus appears at the close of the Book of Jonah, this wonderful apology (defensio) of the all-embracing compassion, the God also of the world-history in this sympathy for the beasts of the earth as the type of the righteous.<p>In 10b most interpreters find an oxymoron: the compassion of the godless is compassionless, the direct opposite of compassion; i.e., he possesses either altogether no compassion, or he shows such as in its principle, its expression, and in its effects is the opposite of what it ought to be (Fl.). Bertheau believes that in the sing. of the predicate &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; he is justified in translating: the compassion of the wicked is a tyranny. And as one may speak of a loveless love, i.e., of a love which in its principle is nothing else than selfishness, so also of a compassionless compassion, such as consists only in gesture and speech without truth of feeling and of active results. But how such a compassionless compassion toward the cattle, and one which is really cruel, is possible, it may be difficult to show. Hitzig's conjecture, &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;, sprang from this thought: the most merciful among sinners are cruel - the sinner is as such not &#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;. The lxx is right in the rendering, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;. The noun &#1512;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; means here not compassion, but, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-30.htm">Genesis 43:30</a> (lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; or &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-26.htm">1 Kings 3:26</a> (lxx &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;), has the meaning the bowels (properly tender parts, cf. Arab. rakhuma, to be soft, tender, with rh&#803;m), and thus the interior of the body, in which deep emotions, and especially strong sympathy, are wont to be reflected (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-8.htm">Hosea 10:8</a>). The singular of the predicate &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; arises here from the unity of the subject-conception: the inwards, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-12.htm">Jeremiah 50:12</a>, from the reference of the expression to each individual of the many. </body></html>
