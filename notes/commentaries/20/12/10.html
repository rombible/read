Or "knoweth" it (q); knows the worth of it and values it, and takes care of it, and is concerned for the preservation of it; he provides sufficient food for it, and gives it; he does not overwork it, but allows it proper rest from labour; and, if in any disorder, will make use of all suitable means to heal it; see an instance of the care of Jacob, that righteous man, of his cattle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-14.htm">Genesis 33:14</a>; and, on the other hand, see an instance of a wicked man's cruelty to his beast in Balaam, for which he was reproved, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-28.htm">Numbers 22:28</a>; by various laws and rules which God has given, it is his will that men should be merciful to their beasts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>; and such who are so will be more especially pitiful and tenderhearted to their fellow creatures; <p>but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel; or "are the mercies of a cruel one" (r); the most tender things which are expressed or done by them are nothing but cruelty; and what then must be their more severe expressions and actions? so the most tender concern which antichrist and his followers show to the souls of men breathes nothing but cruelty; the compassionate methods they take to convert heretics, as they call them, are dark dungeons and stinking prisons, racks and tortures, fire and faggots; these are their wholesome severities; this their kindness to men, to deliver them up to the secular power, to inflict pains and punishments on them the most grievous to save their souls.

The LXX. translates "pitieth." The care for the lower animals, and their kind treatment, are not the produce of modern sentiment and civilization. Mosaic legislation and various expressions in Scripture recognize the duty. God's mercies are over all his works; he saves both man and beast; he hateth nothing that he hath made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>; Wisd. 11:24). So he enacted that the rest of the sabbath should extend to the domestic animals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>); that a man should help the over-burdened beast, even of his enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4, 5</a>); that the unequal strength of the ox and the ass should not be yoked together in the plough (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>); that the ox should not be muzzled when he was treading out the corn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>): that the sitting bird should not be taken from her little brood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>), nor a kid seethed in its mother's milk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>). Such humane injunctions were perhaps specially needed at a time when man's life was little regarded, and animal sacrifices had a tendency to make men cruel and unfeeling, when their symbolical meaning was obscured by long familiarity. These enactments regarding animals, and the mysterious significance affixed to the blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>), afforded speaking lessons of tenderness and consideration for the inferior creatures, and <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> taught regard for the happiness and comfort of fellow men. Our blessed Lord has spoken of God's ears of flowers and the lower creatures of his hand. <span class="cmt_word">But the tender mercies;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the bowels</span>, regarded as the seat of feeling. The wicked cannot be supposed to have "tender mercies;" hence it is best to take the word in the sense of "feelings," "affections." What should be mercy and love are in an evil man only hard-heartedness and cruelty. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>We now place together <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4-12</a>. One proverb concerning the house-wife forms the beginning of this group, and four regarding the management of the house and business form the conclusion.<p>4 A good brave wife is the crown of her husband,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But as rottenness in his bones is one that causeth shame.<p>As <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-16.htm">Proverbs 11:16</a> says of &#1488;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1495;&#1503;, the pleasant wife (&#1495;&#1503;  equals  &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;), that she obtaineth honour, so this proverb of &#1488;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, the good wife (&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;  equals  &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;, virtus), that she raises her husband to higher honour: she is for his self-consciousness &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>), and is also to him such a crown of honour before the world (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). On the contrary, a &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, conducting herself shamefully (cf. regarding the double meaning of this Mishle word, which only here occurs in the fem., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>), is to her husband instar cariei in ossibus. &#1512;&#1511;&#1489; (&#1512;&#1511;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-7.htm">Proverbs 10:7</a>) denotes both the caries and the worm-hole (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/41-19.htm">Job 41:19</a>, &#1506;&#1509; &#1512;&#1511;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503;, worm-eaten wood). Like as the caries slowly but continuously increases, till at last the part of the body which the bone bears and the whole life of the man falls to ruin; so an unhappy marriage gnaws at the marrow of life, it destroys the happiness of life, disturbs the pursuit, undermines the life of the husband. </body></html>
