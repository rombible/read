'kly, to despise, properly levi pendere, levem habere (whence &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, scorn, disgrace), here of a man who lives in a humble position and does not seek to raise himself up. Many of the ancients (lxx, Symmachus, Jerome, Syr., Rashi, Luther, Schultens) explain &#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1500;&#1493; by, and is a servant to himself, serves himself; but in that case the words would have been &#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; (Syr. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468;), or rather &#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;. &#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491; &#1500;&#1493; would be more appropriate, as thus pointed by Ziegler, Ewald, and Hitzig. But if one adheres to the traditional reading, and interprets this, as it must be interpreted: et cui servus (Targ., Graec. Venet.), then that supplies a better contrast to &#1493;&#1495;&#1505;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, for "the first necessity of an oriental in only moderate circumstances is a slave, just as was the case with the Greeks and Romans" (Fl.). A man of lowly rank, who is, however, not so poor that he cannot support a slave, is better than one who boasts himself and is yet a beggar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-29.htm">2 Samuel 3:29</a>). The Hithpa. often expresses a striving to be, or to wish to appear to be, what the adj. corresponding to the verb states, e.g., &#1492;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;, &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;; like the Greek middles, &#x3b5;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, cf. &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; and &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. So here, where with Fleischer we have translated: who makes himself mighty, for &#1499;&#1489;&#1491;, gravem esse, is etymologically also the contrast of &#1511;&#1500;&#1492;. The proverb, Sirach 10:26: &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, &#x3b7;&#787;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; (according to the text of Fritzsche), is a half remodelling, half translation of this before us. </body></html>
