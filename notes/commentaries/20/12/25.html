A foolish man is soon angry, and is hasty in expressing it; he is ever in trouble and running into mischief. It is kindness to ourselves to make light of injuries and affronts, instead of making the worst of them. 17. It is good for all to dread and detest the sin of lying, and to be governed by honesty. 18. Whisperings and evil surmises, like a sword, separate those that have been dear to each other. The tongue of the wise is health, making all whole. 19. If truth be spoken, it will hold good; whoever may be disobliged, still it will keep its ground. 20. Deceit and falsehood bring terrors and perplexities. But those who consult the peace and happiness of others have joy in their own minds. 21. If men are sincerely righteous, the righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. But they that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. 22. Make conscience of truth, not only in words, but in actions. 23. Foolish men proclaim to all the folly and emptiness of their minds. 24. Those who will not take pains in an honest calling, living by tricks and dishonesty, are paltry and beggarly. 25. Care, fear, and sorrow, upon the spirits, deprive men of vigour in what is to be done, or courage in what is to be borne. A good word from God, applied by faith, makes the heart glad. 26. The righteous is abundant; though not in this world's goods, yet in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, which are the true riches. Evil men vainly flatter themselves that their ways are not wrong. 27. The slothful man makes no good use of the advantages Providence puts in his way, and has no comfort in them. The substance of a diligent man, though not great, does good to him and his family. He sees that God gives it to him in answer to prayer. 28. The way of religion is a straight, plain way; it is the way of righteousness. There is not only life at the end, but life in the way; all true comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Under tribute - The comparison is probably suggested by the contrast between the condition of a conquered race (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-30.htm">Judges 1:30-33</a>), and that of the freedom of their conquerors from such burdens. The proverb indicates that beyond all political divisions of this nature there lies an ethical law. The "slothful" descend inevitably to pauperism and servitude. The prominence of compulsory labor under Solomon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a> gives a special significance to the illustration. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. a good word&#8212;one of comfort.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A compassionate or encouraging word from a friend or minister. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop,.... Either an anxious care and solicitude about living in the world, as the word (m) signifies; when it seizes a man's spirits, it depresses them, and keeps them down: or a fear and dread of adversity, or sorrow and grief, on account of some calamity and distress; when it gets into a man's heart, it sinks and bows it down, that it cannot take any pleasure or comfort in anything. The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, a "terrible word troubles the heart of a just man"; or "troubles the heart of man", as the Syriac version; the Targum is, <p>"a word of fear in the heart of man causes fear:'' <p>such is the law, which is a word of terror; which speaks terrible things to men; fills the mind with terror; works wrath in the conscience, and induces a spirit of bondage to fear; bows and keeps under the spirits of men, through a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation; <p>but a good word maketh it glad; a comforting, cheering, and encouraging word from any friend, that compassionates their distressed case; this lifts up the heart and inspires it with joy; so a word in season, spoken by a Gospel minister, raises up a soul that is bowed down, and gives it comfort and joy: such a good word is the Gospel itself; it is good news from a far country, which is like cold water to a thirsty soul, very refreshing and reviving. The Septuagint and Arabic versions here render it, "a good message", and such the Gospel is; which, when brought to the heart of a poor sinner, depressed with the terrors of the law, causes joy in it; such is the word of peace, pardon, righteousness, and eternal life by Christ; such is the word that he himself spoke, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a>.

Care brings dejection and despair; hence the Christian is bidden to beware of excessive anxiety, and not to perplex himself with solicitude for the future (Matthew 6:84; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A good word maketh it glad.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"A word of kindness grief's keen smart can heal."</span> Septuagint, "A word of terror disturbs the heart of a (righteous) man, but a good message will gladden him." The "word of terror" may be an unjust censure, or evil tidings. Says a Servian proverb, "Give me a comrade who will weep with me; one who will laugh I can easily find." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>19 The lip of truth endures for ever,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the lying tongue only while I wink with the eye.<p>None of the old translators understood the phrase &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;; the Venet. also, which follows Kimchi's first explanation, is incorrect: &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, till I split (shatter) it (the tongue). Abulwald is nearer the correct rendering when he takes &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; as a noun  equals  &#1512;&#1490;&#1506; with He parag. Ahron b. Joseph is better in rendering the phrase by: until I make a &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;, and quite correct if &#1512;&#1490;&#1506; (from &#1512;&#1490;&#1506;  equals  Arab. raj', which is used of the swinging of the balance) is taken in the sense of a twinkling of the eye (Schultens: vibramen); cf. Orelli's Die hebr. Synonyme der Zeit und Ewigkeit, p. 27f., where the synonyms for a twinkling of the eye, a moment, are placed together. &#1506;&#1491; (properly progress) has in this phrase the meaning, while, so long as, and the cohortative signifies, in contradistinction to &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506;, which may also denote an unwilling movement of the eyelids, a movement proceeding from a free determination, serving for the measurement of a short space of time, Ewald, 228a. &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a>, where Ewald takes &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; (when I...) in the same sense as &#1488;&#1491;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; here, which is more appropriate than the explanation of Hitzig, who regards &#1499;&#1497; as opening the principal clause, and attaches to &#1492;&#1512;&#1490;&#1497;&#1506; the quite too pregnant signification "to need (for an action) only a moment." The lip of truth, i.e., the lip which speaketh truth, endures for ever (for truth, &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;  equals  &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;, is just the enduring); but the tongue of falsehood is only for a moment, or a wink of the eye, for it is soon convicted, and with disgrace brings to silence; for a post-bibl. Aram. proverb says: &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1488; &#1511;&#1488;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1500;&#1488; &#1511;&#1488;&#1497;, the truth endures, the lie endures not (Schabbath 104a), and a Hebrew proverb: &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1493; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, the lie has no feet (on which it can stand).<p>(Note: Vid., Duke's Rabbin.
