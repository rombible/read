A foolish man is soon angry, and is hasty in expressing it; he is ever in trouble and running into mischief. It is kindness to ourselves to make light of injuries and affronts, instead of making the worst of them. 17. It is good for all to dread and detest the sin of lying, and to be governed by honesty. 18. Whisperings and evil surmises, like a sword, separate those that have been dear to each other. The tongue of the wise is health, making all whole. 19. If truth be spoken, it will hold good; whoever may be disobliged, still it will keep its ground. 20. Deceit and falsehood bring terrors and perplexities. But those who consult the peace and happiness of others have joy in their own minds. 21. If men are sincerely righteous, the righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. But they that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. 22. Make conscience of truth, not only in words, but in actions. 23. Foolish men proclaim to all the folly and emptiness of their minds. 24. Those who will not take pains in an honest calling, living by tricks and dishonesty, are paltry and beggarly. 25. Care, fear, and sorrow, upon the spirits, deprive men of vigour in what is to be done, or courage in what is to be borne. A good word from God, applied by faith, makes the heart glad. 26. The righteous is abundant; though not in this world's goods, yet in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, which are the true riches. Evil men vainly flatter themselves that their ways are not wrong. 27. The slothful man makes no good use of the advantages Providence puts in his way, and has no comfort in them. The substance of a diligent man, though not great, does good to him and his family. He sees that God gives it to him in answer to prayer. 28. The way of religion is a straight, plain way; it is the way of righteousness. There is not only life at the end, but life in the way; all true comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Another aspect of the truth of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-14.htm">Proverbs 10:14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. concealeth&#8212;by his modesty (Pr 10:14; 11:13).<p>heart &#8230; proclaimeth&#8212;as his lips speak his thoughts (compare Ec 10:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Concealeth knowledge; </span> he doth not vain-gloriously and unseasonably utter what he knows, but keeps it in his breast till he hath a fit occasion to bring it forth for God’s glory, and the good of others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Proclaimeth foolishness; </span> whilst he makes ostentation of his knowledge, he betrays his ignorance and folly.

Of things natural or divine, which he is furnished with; not but that he is willing to communicate it, as he should, at proper times, in proper places, and to proper persons; but he does not needlessly and unseasonably speak of it; he does not make a show of it, or boast and brag of it: he modestly forbears to speak of what he knows, but when there is a necessity for it, even of that which may be lawfully divulged; which is a point of prudence and modesty; otherwise it is criminal to reveal secrets, or publish what should be kept private or should not be known. Aben Ezra interprets it of a wise man's hiding his knowledge in his heart, that he may not forget it; <p>but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness; that which they have in their hearts and minds, and which they take for deep knowledge, profound and recondite learning, they proclaim with their mouths in a noisy and clamorous way; and while they declare their ill shaped notions, their incoherent and unconnected ideas of things, they betray their ignorance and folly, as ostentatious men do. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="bld">the heart</span>] Comp.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The heart of fools is in their mouth;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the mouth of wise men is their heart.” <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/21-26.htm" title="The heart of fools is in their mouth: but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.">Sir 21:26</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A prudent man concealeth knowledge</span> (ver. 16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-14.htm">Proverbs 10:14</a>). He is not wont to utter unadvisedly what he knows, but waits for fitting opportunity, either from humility or wise caution. Of course, in some cases reticence is sinful. The LXX., reading the passage differently, renders, "A prudent man is the seat of intelligence (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">The heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-16.htm">Proverbs 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>).

Viewed superficially, the proverb appears tautological; it is not so, however, but places in causal connection the internal character of men and their utterances: whoever breathes &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, truth or conscientiousness (the property of the &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a>), i.e., lets the voice of this be heard in his utterances, such an one speaks &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, i.e., uprightness, integrity, that which is correct, right (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a>), in relation to truth in general, and to the present case in particular; but he who &#1506;&#1491; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., he who, against better knowledge and the consciousness of untruth, confirms by his testimony (from &#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, revertere, to say again and again), therewith gives utterance to his impure character, his wicked intention, proceeding from delight in doing evil or from self-interest, and diverted towards the injury of his neighbour. As &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492; correspond as statements of the contents of the utterances, so &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; and &#1513;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as statements of their motive and aim. &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492; is obj. accus. of the &#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; (from &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, to bring to light, cf. &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, visibility) to be supplied, not the pred. nom. dolorum structor, as Fleischer poetically finds. </body></html>
