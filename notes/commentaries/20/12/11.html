A godly man would not put even an animal to needless pain. But the wicked often speak of others as well used, when they would not endure like treatment for a single day. 11. It is men's wisdom to mind their business, and follow an honest calling. But it is folly to neglect business; and the grace of God teaches men to disdain nothing but sin. 12. When the ungodly see others prosper by sin, they wish they could act in the same way. But the root of Divine grace, in the heart of the righteous, produces other desires and purposes. 13.

We might have expected that the second clause would have ended with such words as "shall lack bread," but the contrast goes deeper.

This was man's work in innocence; this he was doomed to do with the sweat of his brow after his fall; every man has his land to till, or some calling, work, or business, to be employed in, either civil or sacred; and it becomes him to be diligent therein, and such as are shall not want bread, but shall have a sufficiency of it; <p>but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding: that neglects his business, loiters away his time, spends it in the company of vain, empty, and unprofitable persons; as he shows himself by such a choice that he is void of understanding, or "wants a heart" (s), to improve his time and talents; so before long it is much if he does not want a piece of bread. Thus he that is concerned to have the fallow ground of his heart ploughed up, and righteousness, truth, and holiness, sown therein, that it may bring forth fruit; or who is careful about the welfare and salvation of his immortal soul, and makes diligent use of all means to promote its spiritual good, shall be filled with the bread of life, shall find it and eat it, to the joy and rejoicing of his heart; and, on the contrary, he that associates himself with vain persons, empty of all that is spiritually good, that have only empty notions of religion; or who attend to the profane and vain boastings of antichrist, and all false teachers; and give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, whose words eat as do a canker; these, as they show themselves to want wisdom, so they are and will be brought into starving and famishing circumstances in a spiritual sense. Jarchi interprets the former clause of a man that is studious in his doctrine, that revolves it in his mind, that he may not forget it; and the Arabic version renders the last clause, <p>"they that run after false demons, their minds are deficient;'' <p>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a>. <p>(s)  "deficiens corde", Pagninus; "carens corde", Montanus; "deficitur corde", Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">vain</span> persons] We may either supply <span class="ital">persons</span>, with A.V. and R.V. text: or <span class="ital">things</span>, with R.V. marg. and LXX. <span class="greekheb">μάταια</span>, Vulg. <span class="ital">sectatur otium</span>, and in accordance with the usage of this Book in following the Heb. verb here employed by an accus. of a <span class="ital">thing</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-19.htm" title="As righteousness tends to life: so he that pursues evil pursues it to his own death.">Proverbs 11:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-9.htm" title="The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but he loves him that follows after righteousness.">Proverbs 15:9</a>. In the former case the argument expanded will be: To keep bad company argues want of understanding, because it leads not to plenty but to lack of bread.
