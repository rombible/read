A fool, in the sense of Scripture, means a wicked man, one who acts contrary to the wisdom that is from above.

The wholesome advice, the good instruction, and sound doctrine he delivers to others, which are the fruit of his lips, and come forth by them from his heart; these redound to his own advantage, are not only a satisfaction to his mind upon reflection, but because of these he is filled with good things, even to satiety, both in this life and that to come; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-6.htm">1 Timothy 4:6</a>; or a "man shall be satisfied with good from the fruit of the mouth"; or "be satisfied from the fruit of the mouth of a man" (z); that is, of another man; either of a private man, by his prayers, by the account he gives of his own experience, by the conversation he has with him about the truths of the Gospel; or of a faithful minister of the word, who is the means of feeding the souls of men with good things, even to satisfaction, with the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ, with the sincere milk of the word, with the bread of life, even with the finest of the wheat; <p>and the recompence of a man's hand shall be rendered unto him; if his words turn to his account, much more his works; if he is filled with good things for the sake of the one, much more will he be recompensed in a way of grace on account of the other; and not for the one without the other, nor for words without works: or "the recompence of a man's hands", or of his works which his hands do, "he shall render to him" (a); that is, God, who renders to every man according to his works; which serves not to establish the doctrine of merit, but to show the goodness and grace of God in taking notice of and accepting the imperfect works of men through Christ, and for his sake. <p>(z)   "de fructu oris viri", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus, Schultens.

A man's words are like seeds, and if they are wise and pure and kindly, they will bring forth the fruit of love and favour and respect.

The praise which is given to a man measures itself &#1500;&#1508;&#1497; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493; (punctuate &#1500;&#1508;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;, according to Torath Emeth, p. 41, Accentssystem, xx. 1), i.e., according to the measure (so &#1500;&#1508;&#1497; is used in the oldest form of the language) of his intelligence, or as we may also say, of his culture; for in these proverbs, which make the fear of God the highest principle, &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500; means also understanding of moral excellence, not merely the intellectual superiority of natural gifts. &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; is here a relative conception of manifold gradations, but it does not mean renown in general, but good renown. Parallel with &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;, &#1500;&#1489; refers to the understanding (&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;); the rendering of Lwenstein, "who is of false heart," is defective. &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1492; (synon. of &#1504;&#1508;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500; and &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, but nowhere else interchanging with it) means here a vero et recto detortus et aversus (Fl.). Such a man who has not a good understanding, nor any certain rule of judgment, falls under contempt (Graec.
