Those that stifle their convictions, are like brutes. 2. The man who covers selfish and vicious designs under a profession of religion or friendship, will be condemned. 3. Though men may advance themselves by sinful arts, they cannot settle and secure themselves. But those who by faith are rooted in Christ, are firmly fixed. 4. A wife who is pious, prudent, and looks well to the ways of her household, who makes conscience of her duty, and can bear crosses; such a one is an honour and comfort to her husband. She that is the reverse of this, preys upon him, and consumes him. 5. Thoughts are not free; they are under the Divine knowledge, therefore under the Divine command. It is a man's shame to act with deceit, with trick and design. 6. Wicked people speak mischief to their neighbours. A man may sometimes do a good work with one good word. 7. God's blessing is often continued to the families of godly men, while the wicked are overthrown. 8. The apostles showed wisdom by glorying in shame for the name of Christ. 9. He that lives in a humble state, who has no one to wait upon him, but gets bread by his own labour, is happier than he that glories in high birth or gay attire, and wants necessaries.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Virtuous - The word implies the virtue of earnestness, or strength of character, rather than of simple chastity.<p>A crown - With the Jews the sign, not of kingly power only, but also of joy and gladness.

Or "judgment" (o). The thoughts of men's hearts are naturally evil, nor can any think a good thought of themselves; but the thoughts of the righteous are directed and influenced by the grace of God, and are formed according to that Word which is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; their thoughts concerning God and religion, concerning Christ and his Gospel, his ways and worship, his truths and ordinances, they are judiciously framed according to the rule of God's word, the revelation he has made, and so are right; and such are their resolutions and designs to serve the Lord their God, and him only, and to cleave to him with full purpose of heart <p>but the counsels of the wicked are deceit; the designs, schemes, and contrivances of wicked men, are to trick, and overreach, and defraud their neighbours in civil affairs; and of false teachers, to deceive the hearts of the simple in religious ones. The coming of the man of sin was with all deceivableness; and all the gaudy show and pageantry he makes, and pretended miracles he works, are to deceive the inhabitants of the earth; and by his sorceries all nations are deceived, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:10</a>. <p>(o) "judicium", Pagninns, Montanus, Mercerus, Cocceius, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The thoughts of the righteous are right;</span> literally, <span class="accented">judgments</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> just and fair, much more then words and actions. St. Gregory ('Mor. in Job,' lib. 25) takes another view, seeing in "judgments" the stings of conscience, and a rehearsal of the day of account. "The righteous," he says, "approach the secret chambers of the Judge in the recesses of their own hearts; they consider how smartly he smites at last, who long patiently bears with them. They are afraid for the sins which they remember they have committed; and they punish by their tears the faults which they know they have perpetrated. They dread the searching judgments of God, even in those sins which perchance they cannot discover in themselves. And in this secret chamber of inward judgment, constrained by the sentence of their own conduct, they chasten with penitence that which they have committed through pride" (Oxford transl.).

The fruit of the righteous is here not the good which his conduct brings to him, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>, but his activity itself proceeding from an internal impulse.

By this means the wise (righteousness and wisdom come together according to the saying of the Chokma, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>) becomes a winner of souls (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495; as <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>, but taken in bonam partem), or, as expressed in the N.T. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>), a fisher of men, for he gains them not only for himself, but also for the service of wisdom and righteousness. </body></html>
