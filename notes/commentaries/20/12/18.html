Truth may indeed be eclipsed for a little while, but it will come to light: it is great, and will prevail. “Those, therefore, that make a lie their refuge,” says Henry, “will find it a refuge of lies.” Houbigant translates this verse, “Perpetuity is in the lip of truth: the tongue of falsehood is for a point of time.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:16. A foolish man is soon angry, and is hasty in expressing it; he is ever in trouble and running into mischief. It is kindness to ourselves to make light of injuries and affronts, instead of making the worst of them. 17. It is good for all to dread and detest the sin of lying, and to be governed by honesty. 18. Whisperings and evil surmises, like a sword, separate those that have been dear to each other. The tongue of the wise is health, making all whole. 19. If truth be spoken, it will hold good; whoever may be disobliged, still it will keep its ground. 20. Deceit and falsehood bring terrors and perplexities. But those who consult the peace and happiness of others have joy in their own minds. 21. If men are sincerely righteous, the righteous God has engaged that no evil shall happen to them. But they that delight in mischief shall have enough of it. 22. Make conscience of truth, not only in words, but in actions. 23. Foolish men proclaim to all the folly and emptiness of their minds. 24. Those who will not take pains in an honest calling, living by tricks and dishonesty, are paltry and beggarly. 25. Care, fear, and sorrow, upon the spirits, deprive men of vigour in what is to be done, or courage in what is to be borne. A good word from God, applied by faith, makes the heart glad. 26. The righteous is abundant; though not in this world's goods, yet in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, which are the true riches. Evil men vainly flatter themselves that their ways are not wrong. 27. The slothful man makes no good use of the advantages Providence puts in his way, and has no comfort in them. The substance of a diligent man, though not great, does good to him and his family. He sees that God gives it to him in answer to prayer. 28. The way of religion is a straight, plain way; it is the way of righteousness. There is not only life at the end, but life in the way; all true comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The thought which lies below the surface is that of the inseparable union between truth and justice.

The preterite, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-8.htm">Proverbs 11:8</a>, etc., places the general true proposition as a separate historic principle derived from experience. In 12b &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; stands elliptically or pregnantly: edet, scil. quod radix edere solet, sobolem stirpis, ramorum, etc., as in the Arab. natan and a&#770;natan are specially used without an obj. of the spontaneousness of an odour." &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491; (from &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to spy, to hunt) is elsewhere the instrument of the hunt (a net), here the object and end of it. If the words had been &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, then we would explain after &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1497; &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49</a> (vid., comm. on), and &#1488;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24</a>; but in the difference of number, &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; will not be the qualitative but the subjective personal genitive: capturam qualem mali captant. Ewald, who understands &#1512;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, 11b, of good-for-nothing-fellows, interprets &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; here, on the contrary, as neuter (172b): the desire of the wicked is an evil net, i.e., wherein he catches all manner of evil for himself. The lxx has here two proverbs, in which &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1491; occurs in the plur. and in the sense of &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;; 12b of the Hebr. text is rendered: &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;, which Schleusner explains immotae erunt. The Hebr. text can gain nothing from this variation. That the lxx read &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is not probable, since they nowhere thus translate &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;. But Reiske and Ziegler have, like Ewald and Hitzig, combined &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; of this proverb with &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; from &#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; (Arab. wa&#770;tin), firmum, perennem esse. Hitzig translates the distich, after emending the text of 12a by the help of the lxx and the Arab.: the refuge of the wicked is crumbling clay, but the root of the righteous endures (&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; from &#1497;&#1514;&#1503;). Bttcher also reads &#1495;&#1502;&#1512; instead of &#1495;&#1502;&#1491;, and translates (vid., p. 192, l. 11): the refuge of the wicked is miry clay, but the root of the righteous holdeth fast (&#1497;&#1514;&#1503;  equals  Arab. wa&#770;tin). But this derivation of a verb &#1497;&#1514;&#1503; is not necessary. The Graec. Venet. rightly, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;. The obj. is self-evident. Rashi reads &#1502;&#1492; &#1513;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497; &#1500;&#1497;&#1514;&#1503; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1492;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;. So also Schultens. The root giveth, is equivalent to, it is productive in bringing forth that which lies in its nature. That the root of the righteous endures (Targ. &#1504;&#1514;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;) is otherwise expressed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-3.htm">Proverbs 12:3</a>. </body></html>
