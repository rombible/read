Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise. 19. Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people. 20. Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us. 21. To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin. 22. How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it! 23. Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing. 24. The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness. 25. An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light. 26,27. Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death. 28. Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church. 29. A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known. 30. An upright, contented, and benevolent mind, tends to health. 31. To oppress the poor is to reproach our Creator. 32. The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them. 33. Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers. 34. Piety and holiness always promote industry, sobriety, and honesty. 35. The great King who reigns over heaven and earth, will reward faithful servants who honour his gospel by the proper discharge of the duties of their stations: he despises not the services of the lowest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The maxim, jarring as it is, represents the generalization of a wide experience; but the words which follow <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a> show that it is not to be taken by itself. In spite of all the selfish morality of mere prudence, the hearer is warned that to despise his "neighbor" (Christians must take the word in all the width given to it by the parable of the Good Samaritan) is to sin.

As well as of strangers; that is, he is shy of him; he does not care to take any notice of him, or be friendly with him, lest he should be burdensome to him. Poverty brings a man into contempt and disgrace; the same man, in affluence and indigence, is respected or disrespected: this is true, as Gersom observes, of a man that is poor, whether in money or in knowledge, in his purse or in his understanding; <p>but the rich hath many friends; or, "many are the lovers of the rich" (r): for the sake of their riches; either for the sake of honour or profit, or because the rich want nothing of them, or because they themselves may gain something by them: this also is observed by the above Jewish commentator to be true of the rich in substance or in wisdom; but the former sense is best; for a wise man, if poor in the world, is but little regarded. <p>(r)   "et amatores divitiis spissi", Schultens; "dilectores autem divitis multi sunt", Piscator.

The Book of Proverbs contains besides of this verb only the name of dross (recedanea) derived from it; &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;, separated, drawn away, is such a half passive as &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-21.htm">Isaiah 49:21</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>, etc. (Olsh. 245a). Regarding &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, vid., at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a> : a man is so called whose manner of thought and of action has as its impulse and motive self-sacrificing love. When it is said of the former that he is satisfied with his own ways, viz., those which with heart turned away from God he enters upon, the meaning is not that they give him peace or bring satisfaction to him (Lwenstein), but we see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-20.htm">Proverbs 18:20</a>, that this is meant recompensatively: he gets, enjoys the reward of his wandering in estrangement from God. It is now without doubt seen that 14b expresses that wherein the benevolent man finds his reward. We will therefore not explain (after <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-15.htm">Proverbs 4:15</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-26.htm">Numbers 16:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-10.htm">2 Samuel 19:10</a>): the good man turns himself away from him, or the good man stands over him (as Jerome, Venet., after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:7</a>); - this rendering gives no contrast, or at least a halting one. The &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; must be parallel with that of &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493;. From the lxx, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, the Syr. rightly: from the fruit (religiousness) of his soul; the Targ.: from his fruit. Buxtorf, against Cappellus, has already perceived that here no other phrase but the explanation of &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; by ex eo quod penes se est lies at the foundation. We could, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14</a>, also explain: from that which he perceives as his obligation (duty); yet that other explanation lies proportionally nearer, but yet no so that we refer the suffix to the backslider of 14a: in it (his fate) the good man is satisfied, for this contrast also halts, the thought is not in the spirit of the Book of Proverbs (for <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-16.htm">Proverbs 29:16</a> does not justify it); and in how totally different a connection of thought &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is used in the Book of Proverbs, is shown by <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a>; but generally the Scripture does not use &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; of such satisfaction, it has, as in 14a, also in 14b, the recompensative sense, according to the fundamental principle, &#x3bf;&#788;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The suffix refers back to the subject, as we say: &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497; (Psychol. p. 152). But considerations of an opposite kind also suggest themselves. Everywhere else &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; refers not to that which a man has within himself, but that which he carries without; and also that &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; can be used in the sense of &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, no evidence can be adduced: it must be admitted to be possible, since the writer of the Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-4.htm">2 Chronicles 1:4</a>) ventures to use &#1489;&#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;. Is &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; thus used substantively: by his leaves (Aben Ezra and others)? If one compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, this explanation is not absurd; but why then did not the poet rather use &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;? We come finally to the result, that &#1493;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;, although it admits a connected interpretation, is an error of transcription. But the correction is not &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; (Elster) nor &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (Cappellus), for &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, deeds, are words which do not exist; nor is it &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (Bertheau) nor &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (Ewald), but &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; (which Cappellus regarded, but erroneously, as the lxx phrase); for (1) throughout almost the whole O.T., from <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-19.htm">Judges 2:19</a> to <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>, &#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; are interchangeable words, and indeed almost an inseparable pair, cf. particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>; and (2) when Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a>) says, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493; &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511; &#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, this almost sounds like a prophetical paraphrase of the second line of the proverb, which besides by this emendation gains a more rhythmical sound and a more suitable compass.<p>(Note: As here an &#1500; too few is written, so at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a> (&#1493;&#1500;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-14.htm">Psalm 74:14</a> (&#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;) one too many.) </body></html>
