He is cautious, examining before he believes, and trying before he trusts, especially in matters of great moment; and considering things maturely before he does as he is advised. Bochart observes well upon this verse, that “as prudence without simplicity degenerates into craft, so simplicity without prudence is no better than downright folly.

Here are grace and sin in their true colours. Those that despise God's precepts and promises, despise God and all his power and mercy. 3. Pride grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart. The root must be plucked up, or we cannot conquer this branch. The prudent words of wise men get them out of difficulties. 4. There can be no advantage without something which, though of little moment, will affright the indolent. 5. A conscientious witness will not dare to represent anything otherwise than according to his knowledge. 6. A scorner treats Divine things with contempt. He that feels his ignorance and unworthiness will search the Scriptures in a humble spirit. 7. We discover a wicked man if there is no savour of piety in his discourse. 8. We are travellers, whose concern is, not to spy out wonders, but to get to their journey's end; to understand the rules we are to walk by, also the ends we are to walk toward. The bad man cheats himself, and goes on in his mistake. 9. Foolish and profane men consider sin a mere trifle, to be made light of rather than mourned over. Fools mock at the sin-offering; but those that make light of sin, make light of Christ. 10. We do not know what stings of conscience, or consuming passions, torment the prosperous sinner. Nor does the world know the peace of mind a serious Christian enjoys, even in poverty and sickness. 11. Sin ruins many great families; whilst righteousness often raises and strengthens even mean families. 12. The ways of carelessness, of worldliness, and of sensuality, seem right to those that walk in them; but self-deceivers prove self-destroyers. See the vanity of carnal mirth. 14. Of all sinners backsliders will have the most terror when they reflect on their own ways. 15. Eager readiness to believe what others say, has ever proved mischievous. The whole world was thus ruined at first. The man who is spiritually wise, depends on the Saviour alone for acceptance. He is watchful against the enemies of his salvation, by taking heed to God's word. 16. Holy fear guards against every thing unholy. 17. An angry man is to be pitied as well as blamed; but the revengeful is more hateful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Simple - In the bad sense (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

Every thing that is said to him every story that is told him, and every promise that is made him; and so is easily imposed upon, and drawn in to his hurt: every word of God, or doctrine of his, ought to be believed; because whatever he says is true, he cannot lie; every word of his is pure, free from all error and falsehood; it is a tried word, and found to bear a faithful testimony, and, if we receive the witness of then, the witness of God is greater; besides, his word is profitable for instruction, and for the increase of peace, joy, and comfort, and is effectual to saving purposes: every word of Christ is to be believed, who is a teacher sent from God; whose mission is confirmed by miracles, and whose doctrine is not his own as man, but his Father's; he is the faithful witness, and truth itself; his words are more than human, and besides are pleasant and wholesome: and every word and doctrine of his apostles, who received their mission commission, and doctrines from him, is also to be believed; but every spirit, or everyone that pretends to be a spiritual man, and to have spiritual gifts, is not to be believed; but the words and doctrines of ordinary men and ministers are to be first tried by the unerring rule of the sacred Scriptures; yea, the doctrines of the apostles were examined by them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>; they are "simple", weak, silly, foolish persons, that believe all they hear, whether right or wrong, true or false, good or hurtful; they are children in knowledge, who are tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, and are deceived with good words and fair speeches, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>. This truly describes the followers of the man of sin; who give heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; who believe as the church believes; that believe with an implicit faith; believe every word and doctrine the pope and councils say they should, though ever so absurd; as, for instance, the doctrine of transubstantiation: these are "simple" or fools with a witness, who give up their understandings, and even their senses unto, and pin their faith upon, another; <p>but the prudent man looketh well to his going; or "its going" (o); to the course and tendency of the word he hears, or the doctrine which is proposed to his faith; he considers well whether it is agreeable or is contrary to the perfections of God; whether it derogates from the glory of any of the divine Persons; whether it makes for the magnifying the riches of God's grace, and for the debasing of men; or for the depreciating of the one, and setting up of the other; and whether it is a doctrine according to godliness, or not, that tends to promote holiness of heart and life, or to indulge a loose conversation; and according to these criteria he judges and determines whether he shall believe it or not. Or, "to his going"; that is, to the going of the deceiver and impostor; he observes narrowly the methods he takes, the artifices he makes use of, the cunning sleight by which he lies in wait to deceive; how craftily he walks, and handles the word of God deceitfully; and he takes notice of his moral walk and conversation, and, as our Lord says, "ye shall know them by their fruits", <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16</a>. Or else the meaning is, and which seems to be the sense of our version, that he looks well unto, and carefully observes, his own goings; he takes heed to his ways, that they are right; that he is not in ways of his devising and choosing, but in God's ways; in the way of life and salvation by Christ; in the path of faith on him, and in the way of holiness; that he has chosen the way of truth, and walks in that; and that every step he takes in doctrine is according to the word of truth; and that whatever he does in worship is agreeably to the divine rule; and that every path of duty he treads in is according to the same, and as he has Christ for a pattern, and the Spirit for a guide; and that his walk is as becomes the Gospel, worthy of the calling wherein he is called, and that it is circumspect and wise; and such a man may be truly said to be a "prudent" man: the Targum is, <p>"he attends to his good;'' <p>and so he does. <p>(o) "gressum illius, sc. sermonis", Baynus, so some in Mercerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The simple believeth every word.</span> "Simple" (<span class="accented">pethi</span>), the credulous person, open to all influences (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>).

The credulous fool believes all that he hears without proof or examination; having no fixed principles of his own, he is at the mercy of any adviser, and is easily led astray. Ecclus. 19:4, "He that is hasty to give credit is light minded, and he that sinneth (thus) shall offend against his own soul." It is often remarked how credulous are unbelievers in supernaturalism. They who refuse to credit the most assured facts of Christ's history will pin their faith on some philosophical theory or insufficiently supported opinion, and will bluster and contend in maintenance of a notion today which tomorrow will prove untenable and absurd. Many who despise the miraculous teaching of the Bible accept the follies and frauds of spiritualism (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>).

So we may not make &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; the subject (Targ., Symmachus, Jerome, Luther, "fools make sport with sin"), for one is persuaded that &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; is equivalent to &#1499;&#1500; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; &#1502;&#1503; &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (Immanuel, Meri, and others), which would be more admissible if we had &#1502;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>), or if &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509; did not immediately follow (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>). Aquila and Theodotion rightly interpret the relation of the component parts of the sentence: &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;; and this translation of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; also is correct is we take &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; in the sense of a &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (Sir. 7:31), in which the Judaeo-Hellenic actually uses it (vid., Schleusner's Lex.). The idea of sacrificial offering is that of expiation: it is a penitential work, it falls under the prevailing point of view of an ecclesiastical punishment, a satisfactio in a church-disciplinary sense; the forgiveness of sins is conditioned by this, (1) that the sinner either abundantly makes good by restitution the injury inflicted on another, or in some other way bears temporal punishment for it, and (2) that he willingly presents the sacrifices of rams or of sheep, the value of which the priest has to determine in its relation to the offence (by a tax-scale from 2 shekels upwards). The Tor gives accurately the offences which are thus to be atoned for. Here, with reference to 9b, there particularly comes into view the offence against property (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-20.htm">Leviticus 5:20</a>ff.) and against female honour (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-20.htm">Leviticus 19:20-22</a>). Fools fall from one offence into another, which they have to atone for by the presentation of sacrificial offerings; the sacrificial offering mocketh them (&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1509; with accus.-object, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-28.htm">Proverbs 19:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-51.htm">Psalm 119:51</a>), for it equally derides them on account of the self-inflicted loss, and on account of the efforts with which they must make good the effects of their frivolity and madness; while on the contrary, among men of upright character, &#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, a relation of mutual favour, prevails, which does not permit that the one give to the other an indemnity, and apply the Asham- [&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;  equals  trespass-offering] Tor. Symmachus rightly: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. But the lxx confuses this proverb also. Hitzig, with the Syr., follows it and translates:<p>The tents of the foolish are in punishment overthrown [verfllt];<p>The house of the upright is well-pleasing [wolgefllt].<p>Is not this extravagant [ungereimt  equals  not rhymed] in spite of the rhyme? These &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497; [tents] extracted from &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, and this &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; [house] formed out of &#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, are nothing but an aimless and tasteless flourish. </body></html>
