Here are grace and sin in their true colours. Those that despise God's precepts and promises, despise God and all his power and mercy. 3. Pride grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart. The root must be plucked up, or we cannot conquer this branch. The prudent words of wise men get them out of difficulties. 4. There can be no advantage without something which, though of little moment, will affright the indolent. 5. A conscientious witness will not dare to represent anything otherwise than according to his knowledge. 6. A scorner treats Divine things with contempt. He that feels his ignorance and unworthiness will search the Scriptures in a humble spirit. 7. We discover a wicked man if there is no savour of piety in his discourse. 8. We are travellers, whose concern is, not to spy out wonders, but to get to their journey's end; to understand the rules we are to walk by, also the ends we are to walk toward. The bad man cheats himself, and goes on in his mistake. 9. Foolish and profane men consider sin a mere trifle, to be made light of rather than mourned over. Fools mock at the sin-offering; but those that make light of sin, make light of Christ. 10. We do not know what stings of conscience, or consuming passions, torment the prosperous sinner. Nor does the world know the peace of mind a serious Christian enjoys, even in poverty and sickness. 11. Sin ruins many great families; whilst righteousness often raises and strengthens even mean families. 12. The ways of carelessness, of worldliness, and of sensuality, seem right to those that walk in them; but self-deceivers prove self-destroyers. See the vanity of carnal mirth. 14. Of all sinners backsliders will have the most terror when they reflect on their own ways. 15. Eager readiness to believe what others say, has ever proved mischievous. The whole world was thus ruined at first. The man who is spiritually wise, depends on the Saviour alone for acceptance. He is watchful against the enemies of his salvation, by taking heed to God's word. 16. Holy fear guards against every thing unholy. 17. An angry man is to be pitied as well as blamed; but the revengeful is more hateful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Every wise woman - literally, Wise women.

It is plain that the fear of the Lord is upon the heart and before the eyes of such that walk according to the word of God, with a sincere desire to glorify him; for it is by the fear of the Lord that men depart from evil, and because of that they cannot do what others do; and therefore when a man walks uprightly, and his conversation is in all holiness and godliness, it shows that the fear of God has a place in his heart, which influences his outward behaviour; <p>but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him; either God himself, whom the upright walker fears; for he that acts perversely, contrary to the law of God, or transgresses that, and goes out of the way, despises God the lawgiver, tramples upon his authority, stretches out his hand, and commits acts of hostility against him; and he that perverts the Gospel of Christ despises his ministers, and despises Christ himself, and him that sent him. Or else the meaning is, that such a perverse walker despises him that fears the Lord; so Aben Ezra interprets it; and such are generally the contempt of wicked men: to this sense is the Vulgate Latin version, <p>"he that walks in a right way, and fears God, is despised by him that walks in an infamous way;'' <p>but the Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, "is despised": meaning the perverse man. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that walketh in his <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> uprightness feareth the LORD: but <i>he that is</i> perverse in his ways despiseth him.</span><p>(b) That is, in uprightness of heart, and without hypocrisy.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>.

He who lives an upright life does so because he fears the Lord; and his holy conversation is an evidence that he is influenced by religious motives. The outward conduct shows the inward feeling. So he that is <span class="cmt_word">perverse in his ways despiseth him</span> - the Lord. A man is evil in his actions because he has cast off the fear of God; and such wickedness is a proof that he has lost all reverence for God and care to please him. Delitzsch renders, "He walketh in his uprightness who feareth Jahve, and perverse in his ways is he that despiseth him;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the conduct of the two shows the way in which they severally regard God and religion, the former acting conscientiously and uprightly, the latter following his own lusts, which lead him astray. Either interpretation is admissible. Septuagint, "He that walketh in crooked ways (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) shall he dishonoured." The Vulgate gives quite a different turn to the sentence, "He who walketh in the right way and feareth the Lord is despised by him who pursueth the path of shame." This intimates the hatred which sinners feel for the godly (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-4.htm">Job 12:4</a>; and especially Wisd. 2:10-20; and our Lord's warning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-21</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21 Evil pursueth sinners,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the righteous is repaid with good.<p>To &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507; of the punishment which follows after sinners at their heels, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>. Greek art gives wings to Nemesis in this sense. To translate 21b, with Lwenstein, "The pious, the good rewards them," is untenable, for &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, the good (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-27.htm">Proverbs 11:27</a>), never appears personified, only &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, goodness, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>, according to which the lxx &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1490;) &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;. Still less is &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; meant personally, as the Venet. &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, which probably means: righteous conduct will a good one, viz., God, reward. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; .dr is an attribute of God, but never the name of God. So the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, after the manner of verbs of educating and leading (&#1490;&#1502;&#1500;, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;), is connected with a double accusative. The Syr., Targum, and Jerome translate passively, and so also do we; for while we must think of God in the retribuet, yet the proverb does not name Him any more than at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-24.htm">Proverbs 10:24</a>; it is designedly constructed, placing Him in the background, with vague generality: the righteous will one, will they, reward with good - this expression, with the most general personal subject, almost coincides with one altogether passive. </body></html>
