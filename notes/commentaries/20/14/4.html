Some have seen in it an exhortation to kindness towards animals in consideration of their great usefulness. Others, that labour has its disagreeable aspect, but also brings its reward, whether material prosperity (“much increase”) or a more enduring reward. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-9.htm" title="And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.">Galatians 6:9</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/proverbs/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-4.htm" title="Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.">Proverbs 14:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Where no oxen are, the crib is clean — </span>The crib and stable may be easily kept clean where there are few or no oxen: but there is so much advantage arising from tilling the ground, that it is better to have a litter with plenty of oxen, than to have great neatness without them. Some think this is spoken of those who boast much of constant neatness about their houses, &c., which, at the same time, shows they carry on but little business. For where there is much business done, and many persons coming and going, there will necessarily be oftentimes less cleanliness and neatness. This verse, however, may be considered as containing an admonition for the man without doors, (as the first admonished the woman within,) that he should not neglect his husbandry, of which it is well known oxen were the principal instruments, being not only employed in ploughing the ground, and carrying home the crop, but also in treading out the corn.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1 A woman who has no fear of God, who is wilful and wasteful, and indulges her ease, will as certainly ruin her family, as if she plucked her house down. 2. Here are grace and sin in their true colours. Those that despise God's precepts and promises, despise God and all his power and mercy. 3. Pride grows from that root of bitterness which is in the heart. The root must be plucked up, or we cannot conquer this branch. The prudent words of wise men get them out of difficulties. 4. There can be no advantage without something which, though of little moment, will affright the indolent. 5. A conscientious witness will not dare to represent anything otherwise than according to his knowledge. 6. A scorner treats Divine things with contempt. He that feels his ignorance and unworthiness will search the Scriptures in a humble spirit. 7. We discover a wicked man if there is no savour of piety in his discourse. 8. We are travellers, whose concern is, not to spy out wonders, but to get to their journey's end; to understand the rules we are to walk by, also the ends we are to walk toward. The bad man cheats himself, and goes on in his mistake. 9. Foolish and profane men consider sin a mere trifle, to be made light of rather than mourned over. Fools mock at the sin-offering; but those that make light of sin, make light of Christ. 10. We do not know what stings of conscience, or consuming passions, torment the prosperous sinner. Nor does the world know the peace of mind a serious Christian enjoys, even in poverty and sickness. 11. Sin ruins many great families; whilst righteousness often raises and strengthens even mean families. 12. The ways of carelessness, of worldliness, and of sensuality, seem right to those that walk in them; but self-deceivers prove self-destroyers. See the vanity of carnal mirth. 14. Of all sinners backsliders will have the most terror when they reflect on their own ways. 15. Eager readiness to believe what others say, has ever proved mischievous. The whole world was thus ruined at first. The man who is spiritually wise, depends on the Saviour alone for acceptance. He is watchful against the enemies of his salvation, by taking heed to God's word. 16. Holy fear guards against every thing unholy. 17. An angry man is to be pitied as well as blamed; but the revengeful is more hateful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>i. e., Labor has its rough, unpleasant side, yet it ends in profit. So also, the life of contemplation may seem purer, "cleaner "than that of action. The outer business of the world brings its cares and disturbances, but also "much increase." There will be a sure reward of that activity in good works for him who goes, as with "the strength of the ox," to the task to which God calls him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. crib is clean&#8212;empty; so "cleanness of teeth" denotes want of food (compare Am 4:6).

Or "empty" (z), so Jarchi and Aben Ezra. Oxen were used in Judea in several parts of husbandry; in ploughing the land, bringing home the corn, and in threshing or treading it out, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>. Now where these are not, or not used, where husbandry is neglected, there is no straw in the crib for beasts, and much less food for men; or rather, no corn or "wheat" (a) on the "threshingfloor" (b), or in the barn, granary, or storehouse; for so the same word is rendered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a>; and in this manner it is interpreted by Gersom here, as also by Kimchi (c): the word translated "clean" is used for "wheat", <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>. By supplying the negative particle, the whole may be rendered thus; "where no oxen are, the threshingfloor", "granary", or storehouse, "is without wheat"; or there is no wheat "on the floor", or "in the barn", &amp;c. the note of Jarchi on the text is, <p>"where there are no scholars of the wise men, there is no instruction in the constitutions.'' <p>But much better is the mystical sense, thus; that where there are no ministers of the Gospel, there is no food for souls. Oxen are an emblem of faithful and laborious ministers. The ox was one of the emblems in the cherubim, which design Gospel ministers; the names by which oxen are called agree with them. Here are two words used of them in the text; the one comes from a root which signifies to "teach", "lead", "guide", and "govern"; and the same word for "oxen" signifies "teachers", "leaders", "guides", and "governors"; names which most properly belong to ministers of the word: the other word comes from a root which signifies to "see", to "look"; because these creatures are sharp sighted. Ministers are seers, overseers, and as John's living creatures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>; one of which was an ox, were full of eyes, within, and before, and behind. So ministers of the word had need to have good sight, to look into the Scriptures, and search them; to look to themselves and to their flock, and to look out to discover enemies, and danger by them; and to look into their own experience, and into things both past and to come. There is a likeness in ministers to these creatures, as to the nature of them; they are clean, creatures, as such should be that minister in holy things; and chew the cud, as such should revolve in their minds and constantly meditate upon divine things; and, like them, are patient and quiet under the yoke; and are not only strong to labour, but very laborious in the word and doctrine; submit to the yoke, draw the plough of the Gospel; bring home souls to Christ, to his church, and to heaven; and tread out the corn, the mysteries of grace, out of the sacred writings. Now where there are no such laborious and diligent ministers of the word, as there are none in the apostate church of Rome, there is no spiritual food for the souls of men; but a famine of the word, and men perish for lack of knowledge; <p>but much increase is by the strength of the ox; as there is a large increase of the fruits of the earth, through the tillage of it by proper instruments; as by the strong and laborious ox, whose strength is employed in ploughing the ground (d) and treading the corn; which is put for all means of husbandry, where that is used or not: so through the unwearied labours of Gospel ministers, the blessing of God attending them, there is much spiritual food; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-23.htm">Proverbs 13:23</a>. There is an increase of converts, a harvest of souls is brought in; and an increase of gifts and of grace, and of spiritual light and knowledge, and plenty of provisions; which spiritual increase, through the ministry of the word, is owing to God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>. <p>(z) "vacuum", V.

Kimchi under &#1512;&#1489;&#1489;). The rendering: multitudo cibi est ager pauperum, makes the produce the property of the field ( equals  frugum fertilis). &#1504;&#1497;&#1512; .)s is the new field (novale or novalis, viz., ager), from &#1504;&#1497;&#1512;, to make arable, fruitful; properly to raise up, viz., by grubbing and freeing of stones (&#1505;&#1511;&#1468;&#1500;). But why, asks Hitzig, just the new field? As if no answer could be given to this question, he changes &#1504;&#1497;&#1512; into &#1504;&#1497;&#1489;, and finds in 23a the description of a rentier, "a great man who consumes the income of his capital." But how much more intelligible is the new field of the poor man than these capitals (&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;) with their per cents (&#1504;&#1497;&#1489;)! A new field represents to us severe labour, and as belonging to a poor man, a moderate field, of which it is here said, that notwithstanding its freshly broken up fallow, it yet yields a rich produce, viz., by virtue of the divine blessing, for the proverb supposes the ora et labora. Regarding &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;  equals  &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>. Jerome's translation, patrum (properly, heads), follows a false Jewish tradition. In the antithesis, 23b, one is tempted to interpret &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in the sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-21.htm">Proverbs 8:21</a> [substance, wealth], as Schultens, opulentia ipsa raditur quum non est moderamen, and Euchel: that which is essentially good, badly managed, goes to ruin. But &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; at the beginning of a proverb, or of a line of a proverb, in every case means est qui. That a wealthy person is meant, the contrast shows. &#1504;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, which denotes anything taken away or gathered up, has the same meaning here as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1</a> : est qui (Fl. quod, but the parallel does not demand this) abripiatur, i.e., quasi turbine auferatur et perdatur; the word reminds us of &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1492;, whirlwind, but in itself it means only something smooth and altogether carried off. The &#1489;&#1468; is here as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15</a>; elsewhere &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; means with injustice (properly, not-right), <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-29.htm">Ezekiel 22:29</a>; here it is not the &#1489; of the means, but of the mediate cause. While the (industrious and God-fearing) poor man is richly nourished from the piece of ground which he cultivates, many a one who has incomparably more than he comes by his unrighteousness down to a state of beggary, or even lower: he is not only in poverty, but along with this his honour, his freedom, and the very life of his person perish. </body></html>
