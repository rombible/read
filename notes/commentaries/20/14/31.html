Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise. 19. Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people. 20. Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us. 21. To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin. 22. How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it! 23. Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing. 24. The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness. 25. An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light. 26,27. Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death. 28. Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church. 29. A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known. 30. An upright, contented, and benevolent mind, tends to health. 31. To oppress the poor is to reproach our Creator. 32. The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them. 33. Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers. 34. Piety and holiness always promote industry, sobriety, and honesty. 35. The great King who reigns over heaven and earth, will reward faithful servants who honour his gospel by the proper discharge of the duties of their stations: he despises not the services of the lowest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Honoureth him - i. e., God, who is the Maker of poor and rich alike. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>31. reproacheth his Maker&#8212;who is the God of such, as well as of the rich (Pr 22:2; Job 31:15; and specially 1Sa 2:8; Ps 113:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He that oppresseth the poor; </span> that useth him hardly, as the Syriac renders it; that withholdeth from him that which is his due, either by the rules of strict justice, or by the great law of charity, of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-27.htm" title="Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.">Proverbs 3:27</a></span>, and so it is opposed to having mercy in the next clause. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Reproacheth his Maker; </span> whose image the poor man bears, which might challenge respect, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-15.htm" title="Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?">Job 31:15</a></span>; by whose counsel and providence he is made poor, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-7.htm" title="The LORD makes poor, and makes rich: he brings low, and lifts up.">1 Samuel 2:7</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-2.htm" title="The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all.">Proverbs 22:2</a></span>, and who hath declared himself to be their protector and avenger. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He that honoureth him, </span> his image, and works, and laws, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">hath mercy on the poor; </span> doth not only forbear oppressing or injuring of him, but affords him his pity and help. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker,....

"The poor shall never cease out of the land" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>); "The  poor ye have always with you," said Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-11.htm">Matthew 26:11</a>); therefore to harass and oppress the poor because he is in this lowly condition, is virtually to arraign the providence of God, who is the Father of all, and has made all men brothers, however differing in worldly position. Christ puts the duty of aiding the poor on the high ground of his solidarity with his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40, 45</a>), how that in ministering unto the least of these his brethren men are ministering unto him.

Christ himself has consecrated poverty by coming in low estate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>), and they who love and honour him are glad to minister to his brethren in their poverty and distress (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>25 A witness of truth delivereth souls;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he who breathes out lies is nothing but deception.<p>When men, in consequence of false suspicions or of false accusations, fall into danger of their lives (&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; is the designation in the later language of the law of a criminal process), then a tongue which, pressed by conscientiousness and not deterred by cowardice, will utter the truth, saves them.
