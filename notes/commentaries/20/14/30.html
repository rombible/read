Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise. 19. Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people. 20. Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us. 21. To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin. 22. How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it! 23. Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing. 24. The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness. 25. An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light. 26,27. Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death. 28. Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church. 29. A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known. 30. An upright, contented, and benevolent mind, tends to health. 31. To oppress the poor is to reproach our Creator. 32. The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them. 33. Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers. 34. Piety and holiness always promote industry, sobriety, and honesty. 35. The great King who reigns over heaven and earth, will reward faithful servants who honour his gospel by the proper discharge of the duties of their stations: he despises not the services of the lowest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sound heart - literally, "heart of health," that in which all emotions and appetites are in a healthy equilibrium.

A heart made so by the grace of God, in which are sound principles of truth, righteousness, and holiness; these preserve from sin, and so from many diseases; whereby the life of the flesh or body is kept safe and sound, or that is kept in health and vigour; or a "quiet heart" (h); a heart free from wrath, anger, and envy, and such like passions and perturbations; this contributes much to the health of the body, and the comfort of life: or a "healing heart", or "spirit" (i); that is humane, kind, and friendly; that pities and heals the distresses of others, and makes up differences between persons at variance: such an one is "the life of fleshes" (k), as in the original text; or of men, of the same flesh and blood; the life of others, as well as of his own flesh; such an one contributes to the comfortable living of others as well as of himself; <p>but envy the rottenness of the bones; a man that envies the happiness and prosperity of others, this preys upon his own spirits, and not only wastes his flesh, but weakens and consumes the stronger parts of his body, the bones; it is as a "moth" within him, as the Arabic version: the Targum is, <p>"as rottenness in wood, so is envy in the bones;'' <p>hence Ovid (l) calls it "livor edax", and so Martial (m). <p>(h)  "cor leve", Baynus; "cor lene", Mercerus; "cor lenitatis", Gejerus, so Ben Melech.

Thus the Septuagint, "The man of gentle mind (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is the physician of the heart." The tranquil, well controlled heart gives health and vigor to the whole frame (see on Proverbs 15:4). <span class="cmt_word">But envy is the rottenness of the bones</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4</a>). Envy, like a canker, eats away a man's life and strength; it tells on his physical as well as his moral condition. We hays parallel expressions in classical authors. Thus Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:257 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Invidus alterius macrescit rebus opimis."</span> Martial, 'Epigr.,' 5:28 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Rubiginosis cuncta dentibus rodit;<br />Hominem malignum forsan esse tu credas,<br />Ego esse miserum credo, cui placet nemo."</span> Bengal proverb, "In seeing another's wealth it is not good to have the eyes smart." Arabic. "Envy is a raging fever, and has no rest" (Lane). "O invidia," cries St. Jerome ('Epist.,' 45), "primum mordax tui." "When the foul sore of envy corrupts the vanquished heart," says St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:85). "the very exterior itself shows how forcibly the mind is urged by madness. For paleness seizes the complexion, the eyes are weighed down, the spirit is inflamed, while the limbs are chilled, there is frenzy in the heart, there is gnashing with the teeth, and while the growing bate is buried in the depths of the heart, the pent wound works into the conscience with a blind grief" Septuagint, "A sensitive heart (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span>) is a worm (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) in the bones." A heart that feels too acutely and is easily affected by external circumstances, prepares for itself constant vexation and grief. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>24 It is a crown to the wise when they are rich;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the folly of fools remains folly.<p>From <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4</a>, 31; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-6.htm">Proverbs 17:6</a>, we see that &#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is the predicate. Thus it is the riches of the wise of which it is said that they are a crown or an ornament to them. More than this is said, if with Hitzig we read, after the lxx, &#1506;&#1512;&#1502;&#1501;, their prudence, instead of &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1501;. For then the meaning would be, that the wise need no other crown than that which they have in their prudence. But yet far more appropriately "riches" are called the crown of a wise man when they come to his wisdom; for it is truly thus that riches, when they are possessed along with wisdom, contribute not a little to heighten its influence and power, and not merely because they adorn in their appearance like a crown, or, as we say, surround as with a golden frame, but because they afford a variety of means and occasions for self-manifestation which are denied to the poor. By this interpretation of 24a, 24b comes out also into the light, without our requiring to correct the first &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, or to render it in an unusual sense. The lxx and Syr. translate the first &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1514; by &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769; (by a circumlocution), the Targ. by gloria, fame - we know not how they reach this. Schultens in his Com. renders: crassa opulentia elumbium crassities, but in his Animadversiones he combines the first &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1514; with the Arab. awwale, precedence, which Gesen. approves of. But although the meaning to be thick (properly coalescere) appertains to the verbal stem &#1488;&#1493;&#1500; as well as the meaning to be before (Arab. a&#770;l, a&#770;wila, wa&#770;l), yet the Hebr. &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; always and everywhere means only folly,<p>(Note: Ewald's derivation of &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; from &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1503;, null, vain, is not much better than Heidenheim's from &#1488;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;: one who says "perhaps"  equals  a sceptic, vid., p. 59, note.)<p>from the fundamental idea crassities (thickness). Hitzig's &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (which denotes the consequence with which the fool invests himself) we do not accept, because this word is Hitzig's own invention. Rather &#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1514; is to be expected: the crown with which fools adorn themselves is folly. But the sentence: the folly of fools is (and remains) folly (Symmachus, Jerome, Venet., Luther), needs the emendation as little as <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-22.htm">Proverbs 16:22</a>, for, interpreted in connection with 24a, it denotes that while wisdom is adorned and raised up by riches, folly on the other hand remains, even when connected with riches, always the same, without being either thereby veiled or removed - on the contrary, the fool, when he is rich, exhibits his follies always more and more.
