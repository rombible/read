Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise. 19. Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people. 20. Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us. 21. To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin. 22. How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it! 23. Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing. 24. The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness. 25. An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light. 26,27. Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death. 28. Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church. 29. A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known. 30. An upright, contented, and benevolent mind, tends to health. 31. To oppress the poor is to reproach our Creator. 32. The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them. 33. Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers. 34. Piety and holiness always promote industry, sobriety, and honesty. 35. The great King who reigns over heaven and earth, will reward faithful servants who honour his gospel by the proper discharge of the duties of their stations: he despises not the services of the lowest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal reference and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27.

Where the true fear of God is, there is a real principle of grace, which is "a well of living water, springing up unto everlasting life", <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>; eternal life is connected with it; it makes meet for it, and issues in it: or the Lord, who is the object of fear, he is the fountain of life: as of natural, so of spiritual and eternal life; spiritual life springs from him, is supported and maintained by him, the consequence of which is life everlasting; <p>to depart from the snares of death; sins, transgressions, as Aben Ezra interprets it; these are the works of men's hands, in which they are snared; these are the cords in which they are holden, and so die without instruction; the wages of them are death, even death eternal: likewise there are the snares of the world and of the devil, temptations to sin, with which being ensnared, lead to death; now the fear of the Lord is a means of delivering from and of avoiding those snares, and so of escaping death. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>.

He who despiseth his neighbour (write &#1489;&#1468;&#1494; with Metheg, and vid., regarding the constr. with dat. object. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-12.htm">Proverbs 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>) sins in this respect, that he raises himself proudly and unwarrantably above him; that the honour and love he shows to him he measures not by the rule of duty and of necessity, but according to that which is pleasing to himself; and in that he refuses to him that which according to the ordinance of God he owes him. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a> the Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; and the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; (vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-13.htm">Psalm 9:13</a>) interchange in an inexplicable way; &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; is the bowed down (cf.

One does not see why the Ker&#305;&#770; here exchanges that passive idea for this ethical one, especially since, in proving himself to be &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; (compassionate) (for which elsewhere the part.
