Sin is the shame of sinners; but wisdom is the honour of the wise. 19. Even bad men acknowledge the excellency of God's people. 20. Friendship in the world is governed by self-interest. It is good to have God our Friend; he will not desert us. 21. To despise a man for his employment or appearance is a sin. 22. How wisely those consult their own interest, who not only do good, but devise it! 23. Labour of the head, or of the hand, will turn to some good account. But if men's religion runs all out in talk and noise, they will come to nothing. 24. The riches of men of wisdom and piety enlarge their usefulness. 25. An upright man will venture the displeasure of the greatest, to bring truth to light. 26,27. Those who fear the Lord so as to obey and serve him, have a strong ground of confidence, and will be preserved. Let us seek to this Fountain of life, that we may escape the snares of death. 28. Let all that wish well to the kingdom of Christ, do what they can, that many may be added to his church. 29. A mild, patient man is one that learns of Christ, who is Wisdom itself. Unbridled passion is folly made known. 30. An upright, contented, and benevolent mind, tends to health. 31. To oppress the poor is to reproach our Creator. 32. The wicked man has his soul forced from him; he dies in his sins, under the guilt and power of them. But godly men, though they have pain and some dread of death, have the blessed hope, which God, who cannot lie, has given them. 33. Wisdom possesses the heart, and thus regulates the affections and tempers. 34. Piety and holiness always promote industry, sobriety, and honesty. 35. The great King who reigns over heaven and earth, will reward faithful servants who honour his gospel by the proper discharge of the duties of their stations: he despises not the services of the lowest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Crowned - The teacher anticipates the truth, and the paradox, of the Stoic saying, "The wise is the only king." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

Wicked men before good men. This, as Jarchi observes, respects future time; even the latter day glory, or the spiritual times of the Messiah, when the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the saints of the most High: for though there may have been some few instances of this kind, as Haman bowing before Mordecai, and the Heathen emperors before Constantine; and there may be some now, in some cases where obligation requires; yet this is far from being general, as it will be in the spiritual reign of Christ; when the sons of those that afflicted the church will come bending to her, and they that have despised her shall bow themselves down at the soles of her feet; and even great personages too shall bow down and lick the dust of her feet; the kings of the earth, who before have been in confederacy with antichrist, and have persecuted the saints, now shall hate the whore, and honour the true church of Christ: this will be in the Philadelphian state, which is the same with the spiritual reign of Christ; such who called themselves Jews, and are not, shall come and worship before the feet of the church, and own that she and her members are the favourites of heaven, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-23.htm">Isaiah 49:23</a>; <p>and the wicked at the gates of the righteous; or, "come to the gates of the righteous", as the Syriac version supplies it; they come and knock there, stand and wait, or lay themselves down; become prostrate and humble supplicants for relief and protection, as beggars do. This may also respect their attendance at Wisdom's gates, at the gates of Zion, on public ordinances, for counsel and instruction, which before they despised, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-34.htm">Proverbs 8:34</a>. The Septuagint version is, "shall serve thy gates"; that is, at them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-11.htm">Isaiah 60:11</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The evil bow before the good; and the wicked <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> at the gates of the righteous.</span><p>(k) If this come not daily to pass, we must consider that it is because of our sins, which hinder God's workings.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The evil bow before the good; and the wicked stand at the gates of the righteous</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-34.htm">Proverbs 8:34</a>). The final victory of good over evil is here set forth. However triumphant for a time and apparently prosperous the wicked may be, their success is not lasting; they shall in the end succumb to the righteous, even as the Canaanite kings crouched before Joshua's captains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>), and, hurled from their high estate, they shall stand humbly at the good man's door, begging for bread to support their life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>). The contrast here indicated is seen in our Lord's parable of Dives and Lazarus, when the beggar is comforted and the rich man is tormented, and when the latter urgently sues for the help of the once despised outcast to mitigate the agony which he is suffering (comp. Wisd. 5). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13 Even in the midst of laughter the heart experiences sadness;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to it, joy, the end is sorrow.<p>Every human heart carries the feeling of disquiet and of separation from its true home, and of the nothingness, the transitoriness of all that is earthly; and in addition to this, there is many a secret sorrow in every one which grows out of his own corporeal and spiritual life, and from his relation to other men; and this sorrow, which is from infancy onward the lot of the human heart, and which more and more depends and diversifies itself in the course of life, makes itself perceptible even in the midst of laughter, in spite of the mirth and merriment, without being able to be suppressed or expelled from the soul, returning always the more intensely, the more violently we may have for a time kept it under and sunk it in unconsciousness. Euchel cites here the words of the poet, according to which 13a is literally true:<p>"No, man is not made for joy;<p>Why weep his eyes when in heart he laughs?"<p>(Note: "Nein, der Mensch ist zur Freude nicht gemacht, Darum weint sein Aug' wenn er herzlich lacht.")<p>From the fact that sorrow is the fundamental condition of humanity, and forms the background of laughter, it follows, 13b, that in general it is not good for man to give himself up to joy, viz., sensual (worldly), for to it, joy, the end (the issue) is sorrow. That is true also of the final end, which according to that saying, &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;, changes laughter into weeping, and weeping into laughter. The correction &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1492; (Hitzig) presses upon the Mishle style an article in such cases rejected, and removes a form of expression of the Hebr. syntaxis ornata, which here, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>, is easily obviated, but which is warranted by a multitude of other examples, vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a> (also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>), and cf. Philippi's Status Const. p. 14f., who regards the second word, as here &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492;&#1492;, after the Arab., as accus. But in cases like &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;, although not in cases such as <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a>, the accus. rendering is tenable, and the Arab. does not at all demand it.<p>(Note: Regarding the supplying (ibda&#770;l) of a foregoing genitive or accus. pronoun of the third person by a definite or indefinite following, in the same case as the substantive, Samachschar speaks in the Mufassal, p. 94ff., where, as examples, are found: raeituhu Zeidan, I have seen him, the Zeid; marartu bihi Zeidin, I have gone over with him, the Zeid; saraftu wugu&#770;haha&#770; awwaliha&#770;, in the flight I smote the heads of the same, their front rank. Vid., regarding this anticipation of the definite idea by an indefinite, with explanations of it, Fleischer's Makkar, Additions et Corrections, p. xl. <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a>, and Dieterici's Mutanabbi, p. 341, l. 13.)<p>In the old Hebr. this solutio of the st. constr. belongs to the elegances of the language; it is the precursor of the vulgar post-bibl. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1497;&#1492;&#1468; &#1513;&#1474;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1492;. That the Hebr. may also retain a gen. where more or fewer parts of a sentence intervene between it and its governing word, is shown by such examples as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>.<p>(Note: These examples moreover do not exceed that which is possible in the Arab., vid., regarding this omission of the muda&#770;f, where this is supplied from the preceding before a genitive, Samachschar's Mufassal, p. 34, l. 8-13. Perhaps &#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1498;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-7.htm">Obadiah 1:7</a>, of thy bread  equals  the (men) of thy bread, is an example of the same thing.) </body></html>
