The latter interpretation is preferred by Bishop Patrick, whose paraphrase is, “He that affects singularity, inquires into all manner of things, according as his vain-glorious humour leads him; which makes him also bend himself, with all the wit he hath, to overthrow the solid reasonings of wiser men.” In consistency with this view of the verse, the bishop thus interprets the next: “For a fool will never take pleasure in true understanding, but the design of his studies is to make a vain ostentation of wisdom unto others; this is his chiefest pleasure, to hear himself discourse: that is, discover the folly that is in his heart.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1 If we would get knowledge and grace, we must try all methods of improving ourselves. 2.

Other renderings are<p>(1) He who separateth himself from others seeks his own desire, and rushes forward against all wise counsel: a warning against self-will and the self-assertion which exults in differing from the received customs and opinions of mankind.<p>(2) he who separates himself (from the foolish, unlearned multitude) seeks his own desire (that which is worthy to be desired), and mingleth himself with all wisdom. So the Jewish commentators generally.<p>Between (1) blaming and (2) commending the life of isolation, the decision must be that (1) is most in harmony with the temper of the Book of Proverbs; but it is not strange that Pharisaism, in its very name, separating and self-exalting, should have adopted (2). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 18<p>Pr 18:1-24.<p>1.

According to this interpretation the sense is, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Through desire</span> (of it, to wit of wisdom, which is easily understood out of the end of the verse; such ellipses being frequent in Scripture) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a man, having separated himself, </span>( being sequestered from the company, and noise, and business of the world, betaking himself to retirement and solitude, as men do that apply themselves to any serious study.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">seeketh</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">intermeddleth with all wisdom, </span> i.e. useth all diligence, that he may search and find out all solid knowledge and true wisdom. And this earnest desire and endeavour to get true wisdom within a man’s self is fitly opposed to the fool’s contempt of wisdom, or to his desire of it, not for use and benefit, but only for vain ostentation, which is expressed in the next verse, although coherence is little regarded by interpreters in the several verses and proverbs of this book. But this verse is otherwise rendered in the margin of our English Bible, and by divers others, <span class="ital">He that separateth himself</span>, (either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. From his friend; or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. From other men; who affects singularity, is wedded to his own opinion, and through self-conceit despiseth the opinions and conversation of others,) seeketh according to his desire, (seeketh to gratify his own inclinations and affections, and chooseth those opinions which most comply with them,) and <span class="ital">intermeddleth</span> (for this word is used in a bad sense, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-14.htm" title="The beginning of strife is as when one lets out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.">Proverbs 17:14</a> 20:3</span>, and it is not found elsewhere, save in this place) in every business, as proud and singular persons are commonly pragmatical, delighting to find faults in others, that they may get some reputation to themselves by it.

Or, "a separated man seeketh desire" (g); his own desire, will, and pleasure. This is either to be understood in a good sense, of one that has a real and hearty desire after sound wisdom and knowledge, and seeks in the use of all proper means to attain it; and in order to which he separates himself from the world and the business of it, and retires to his study, and gives up himself to reading, meditation, and prayer; or goes abroad in search of it, as Aben Ezra: or of a vain man that affects singularity; and who, through a desire of gratifying that lust, separates himself, not only from God, as Jarchi interprets it, pursuing his evil imagination and the lust of his heart; and from his friends, as the Septuagint and Arabic versions; but from all men, like the Jews, who "please not God, and are contrary to all men"; so such a man sets himself to despise and contradict the sentiments and opinions of others, and to set up his own in opposition to them. This is true of the Pharisees among the Jews, who had their name from separating themselves from all others, having an high opinion of their own Wisdom and sanctify; and also of the Gnostics among the Christians, who boasted of their knowledge, and separated themselves from the Christian assemblies; and were sensual, not having the Spirit, being vainly puffed up with their fleshly mind; <p>and intermeddleth with all wisdom; the man who is desirous of being truly wise and knowing grasps at all wisdom, every branch of useful knowledge; would gladly learn something of every art and science worthy of regard; and he makes use of all means of improving himself therein; and covets the company and conversation of men of wisdom and knowledge, that he may attain to more; he intermingles himself with men of wisdom, as Aben Ezra interprets it, and walks and converses with them. Or if this is to be understood of a vain glorious person, the sense is, "he intermeddles" or "mingles himself with all business" (h), as it may be rendered; he thrusts himself into affairs that do not concern him, and will pass his judgment on things he has nothing to do with; or he monopolizes all knowledge to himself, and will not allow any other to have any share with him. Jarchi interprets this clause thus, <p>"among wise men his reproach shall be made manifest;'' <p>and observes, that their Rabbins explain it of Lot separating from Abraham, following the desires of his heart: but R. Saadiah Gaon better interprets it of an apostate from religion; that objects to everything solid and substantial, in a wrangling and contentious manner; and "shows his teeth" (i) at it, as Schultens, from the use of the Arabic word, renders it. <p>(g) So the Targum. (h)   "immiscet se omni negotio", Munster; "omnibus quae sunt immiscet se", Junius &amp; Tremellius.

We must, however, render with R.V.:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He that separateth himself seeketh</span> <span class="ital">his own</span> <span class="bld">desire</span>:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He rageth against</span> (or, <span class="bld">quarrelleth with</span>, marg.) <span class="bld">all sound wisdom</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The proverb then is a condemnation of the selfish isolation of the self-seeker or the misanthrope. Mr Horton, who has an interesting chapter on this verse, writes:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Shakespeare might have had this proverb before him in that grim delineation of Richard the Third, who boasts that he has neither pity, love, nor fear. He was, he had been told, born with teeth in his mouth,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘And so I was,’ he exclaims, ‘which plainly signified<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And then he explains this terrible character in these significant lines:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘I have no brother, I am like no brother:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And this word Love, which greybeards call divine,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Be resident in <span class="ital">men like one another</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And not in me; <span class="ital">I am myself alone</span>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">III. K. Henry VI</span>. Act v. Sc. 6.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wisdom</span>] Or, <span class="bld">sound wisdom</span>, R.V., as the same Heb. word is rendered in A.V. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm" title="He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.">Proverbs 2:7</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - This is a difficult verse, and has obtained various interpretations. The Authorized Version gives, <span class="cmt_word">Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a man who has an earnest desire for self-improvement will hold himself aloof from worldly entanglements, and, occupying himself wholly in this pursuit, will become conversant with all wisdom. This gives good sense, and offers a contrast to the fool in ver. 2, who "hath no delight in understanding." But the Hebrew does not rightly bear this interpretation. Its conciseness occasions ambiguity. Literally, <span class="accented">For his desire a man who separates himself seeks</span>; <span class="accented">in</span> (or <span class="accented">against</span>)  <span class="accented">all wisdom he mingles himself.</span> There is a doubt whether the life of isolation is praised or censured in this verse. Aben Ezra and others of Pharisaic tendencies adopt the former alternative, and explain pretty much as the Authorized Version, thus: "He who out of love of wisdom divorces himself from home, country, or secular pursuits, such a man will mix with the wise and prudent, and be conversant with such." But the maxim seems rather to blame this separation, though here, again, there is a variety of interpretation. Delitzsch, Ewald, and others translate, "He that dwelleth apart seeketh pleasure, against all sound wisdom he showeth his teeth" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-14.htm">Proverbs 17:14</a>). Nowack, after Bertheau, renders, "He who separates himself goes after his own desire; with all that is useful he falls into a rage." Thus the maxim is directed against the conceited, self-willed man, who sets himself against public opinion, delights in differing from received customs, takes no counsel from others, thinks nothing of public interests, but in his mean isolation attends only to his own private ends and fancies (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>). The Septuagint and Vulgate (followed by Hitzig) read in the first clause, for <span class="accented">taavah</span>, "desire<span class="accented"></span>," <span class="accented">taanah</span>, "occasion;" thus: "He who wishes to separate from a friend seeks occasions; but at all time he will be worthy of censure." The word translated "wisdom" (<span class="accented">tushiyah</span>) also means "substance," "existence;" hence the rendering, "at all time," <span class="accented">omni existentia</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">omni tempore.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>23 Bribery from the bosom the godless receiveth,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To pervert the ways of justice.<p>Regarding &#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1491;, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-8.htm">Proverbs 17:8</a>.

Since this is done to give to the course of justice a direction contrary to rectitude, the giver of the bribe has not right on his side; and, under the circumstances, the favourable decision which he purchases may be at once the unrighteous sentence of a &#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1511;, accusing him, or accused by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-5.htm">Proverbs 18:5</a>. </body></html>
