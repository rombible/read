The well-spring of wisdom in the heart of a believer, continually supplies words of wisdom. 5. The merits of a cause must be looked to, not the person. 6,7. What mischief bad men do to themselves by their ungoverned tongues! 8. How base are those that sow contention! and what fatal effects may be expected from small beginnings of jealousy! 9. Omissions of duty, and in duty, are fatal to the soul, as well as commissions of sin. 10,11. The Divine power, made known in and through our Lord Jesus Christ, forms a strong tower for the believer, who relies on the Lord. How deceitful the defence of the rich man, who has his portion and treasure in this world! It is a strong city and a high wall only in his own conceit; for it will fail when most in need. They will be exposed to the just wrath of that Judge whom they despised as a Saviour. 12. After the heart has been lifted up with pride, a fall comes. But honour shall be the reward of humility. 13. Eagerness, with self-conceit, will expose to shame. 14. Firmness of mind supports under many pains and trials. But when the conscience is tortured with remorse, no human fortitude can bear the misery; what then will hell be? 15. We must get knowledge, not only into our heads, but into our hearts. 16. Blessed be the Lord, who makes us welcome to come to his throne, without money and without price. May his gifts make room for him in our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "gift" (or, bribe), by a bold personification, appears as the powerful "friend at court," who introduces another, and makes him welcome in high places. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

Or "enlarges him" (y); brings him out of prison, or, or out of straits and difficulties with which he, has, been pressed; or it makes way for him to a judge, and for a favourable hearing of his cause; or it enlarges his acquaintance, and gains him respect among men; <p>and bringeth him before great men; it opens a way for him into the presence and company of great men, being a fee to their servants; or with it he procures a place to wait on them. It is not necessary to understand it of a gift by way of bribe; but to introduce a person to another, and render him acceptable, and appease anger; as in the cases of Jacob and Abigail, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-20.htm">Genesis 32:20</a>. <p>(y)  <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A man's gift <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.</span><p>(i) Gets him liberty to speak, and the favour of them that are esteemed.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>.

Some consider it to mean a bribe offered for underhand or fraudulent purposes; but the context does not lead to this conclusion, and the parallel passage mentioned above makes against it. Hitzig sees in it a spiritual gift, equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; but such a meaning is not elsewhere attached to the word. The term here signifies the present which duty or friendship offers to one whom one wishes to please. This paves a man's way to a great person's presence. <span class="cmt_word">Bringeth him before great men.</span> The Oriental custom of offering suitable gifts to one in authority, when a favour or an audience is desired, is here alluded to (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>). So the Magi brought gifts so the newborn King at Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>). In a spiritual sense, the right use of riches opens the way to eternal life, evincing a man's practical love of God and man; as Christ says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>), "Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles" (Revised Version). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Two proverbs, of the fortress of faith, and of the fortress of presumption:<p>10 A strong tower is the name of Jahve;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The righteous runneth into it, and is high.<p>The name of Jahve is the Revelation of God, and the God of Revelation Himself, the creative and historical Revelation, and who is always continually revealing Himself; His name is His nature representing itself, and therefore capable of being described and named, before all the Tetragramm, as the Anagramm of the overruling and inworking historical being of God, as the Chiffre of His free and all-powerful government in grace and truth, as the self-naming of God the Saviour. This name, which is afterwards interwoven in the name Jesus, is &#1502;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-4.htm">Psalm 61:4</a>), a strong high tower bidding defiance to every hostile assault. Into this the righteous runneth, to hide himself behind its walls, and is thus lifted (perf. consec.) high above all danger (cf. &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>). &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; &#1488;&#1500; means, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-26.htm">Job 15:26</a>, to run against anything, &#1512;&#1493;&#1509;, seq. acc., to invest, blockade anything, &#1512;&#1493;&#1509; &#1489;&#1468;, to hasten within; Hitzig's conjecture, &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; riseth up high, instead of &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, is a freak. &#1512;&#1493;&#1509; &#1489;&#1468; is speedily &#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;, the idea the same as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-21.htm">Psalm 31:21</a>. </body></html>
