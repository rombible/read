As perhaps Tertullus did, before Paul made his defence; and as Ziba, Mephibosheth's servant, before his master detected him: this often appears true in telling a tale, in private conversation, in lawsuits before a judge and a court of judicature, and in theological controversies; <p>but his neighbour cometh, and searcheth him; his neighbour comes into the house, where he is telling his tale, and reports it in another manner, and shows the falsehood of his relation; or he comes into a court of judicature, and sets the cause in quite another light; or he comes out into the worm by public writing, and exposes the errors of a man engaged in a wrong cause, and refutes his arguments. It is generally understood of judicial affairs, that the first that opens a cause is very apt to prejudice the judge and court in his favour, and they are ready to thing at first hearing that he is in the right; but it is not proper to be hasty in forming a judgment till the other side is heard; for his antagonist comes and traverses the point, unravels the whole affair, shows the weakness of his cause, the vanity of his pretences, and makes void all his allegations; and then "he", the judge, so some interpret it, "searcheth"; inquires more narrowly into the case, in order to find out truth, and pass a right judgment and sentence. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{k}</span> <i>He that is</i> first in his own cause <i>seemeth</i> just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.</span><p>(k) He who speaks first, is best heard from the wicked judge, but when his adversary enquires out the matter it turns to his shame.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">in his own cause</span>] i.e. in pleading, or stating it.

Thus the maxims, "One story is good till the other is told," and "Audi alteram partem," receive confirmation. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Justus prior est accusator sui.</span> So Septuagint, "The righteous is his own accuser in opening the suit (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>)." He cuts the ground from under the adversary's feet by at once owning his fault. St. Gregory more than once, in his 'Moralia,' adduces this rendering. Thus on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>, "To put the mouth to labour is to employ it in the confession of sin done, but the righteous man doth not refrain his mouth, in that, forestalling the wrath of the searching Judge, he falls wroth upon himself in words of self-confession. Hence it is written, 'The just man is first the accuser of himself'" (so lib. 22:33). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11 The possession of the righteous is his strong fort,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And is like a high wall in his imagination.<p>Line first  equals  <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-15.htm">Proverbs 10:15</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; from &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492;, Chald. &#1505;&#1499;&#1492;(whence after Megilla 14a, &#1497;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, she who looks), R. &#1513;&#1474;&#1498;, cogn. &#1494;&#1498;, to pierce, to fix, means the image as a medal, and thus also intellectually: image (conception, and particularly the imagination) of the heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-7.htm">Psalm 73:7</a>), here the fancy, conceit; Fleischer compares (Arab.) ts&#803;wwr, to imagine something to oneself, French se figurer.
