Thus Houbigant interprets it after many of the versions: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-14.htm" title="House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.">Proverbs 19:14</a>. <span class="ital">Findeth a good thing</span> — A singular blessing; <span class="ital">and obtaineth favour of the Lord — </span>Obtaineth her, not by his own wisdom, or art, or endeavours, merely or chiefly, but by God’s good providence toward him, which orders that and all other events as it pleases him.

Great care must be taken to prevent quarrels among relations and those under obligations to each other. Wisdom and grace make it easy to forgive; but corruption makes it difficult. 20. The belly is here put for the heart, as elsewhere; and what that is filled with, our satisfaction will be accordingly, and our inward peace. 21. Many a one has caused his own death, or the death of others, by a false or injurious tongue. 22. A good wife is a great blessing to a man, and it is a token of Divine favour. 23. Poverty tells men they must not order or demand. And at the throne of God's grace we are all poor, and must use entreaties. 24. Christ Jesus never will forsake those who trust in and love him. May we be such friends to others, for our Master's sake. Having loved his own, which were in the world, he loved them unto the end; and we are his friends if we do whatever he commands us, Joh 15:14.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sense seems to require, "Whoso findeth a good wife," as in some Chaldee manuscripts; but the proverb writer may be looking at marriage in its ideal aspect, and sees in every such union the hands of God joining together man and woman for their mutual good. The Septuagint adds "He who casts out a good wife, casts away that which is good: but he that keepeth an adulteress is foolish and ungodly." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

A good one; so the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, supply it; and so the Targum, though it leaves out the word good in the last clause; and no other can be meant, even a good natured one, wise, prudent, careful, and industrious; a proper helpmeet, a virtuous woman, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a>; whoso seeks after such an one, and finds one, especially one that has the grace of God, which he should seek after among his friends, and by their assistance, and by prayer to God: <p>findeth a good thing; that will be good for him, both upon a civil and spiritual account; the Septuagint version adds, <p>"he that casts out a good wife casts out good things, but he that retains a whore is foolish and ungodly;'' <p>which is followed by the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, but is not in the Hebrew text.

Ecclus. 26:1, etc., "Blessed is the man that hath a good wife, for the number of his days shall be double.

A good wife is a good portion which shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord." "A good wife," says the Talmud. "is a good gift; she shall be given to a man that feareth God." And again, "God did not make woman from man's head, that she should not rule over him; nor from his feet, that she should not be his slave; but from his side, that she should be near his heart" (Dukes, p. 69).

It seems to be a further explanation of the statement in the text, founded on the practice prevalent at the time when the Septuagint Version was composed, which appears to have made divorce a recognized necessity in the case of adultery: "He who casteth away a good a wife casteth away good things; but he who retaineth an adulteress is a fool and impious." The advice of Siracides concerning a wicked wife is austere: "If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh" (Ecclus. 25:26). Nothing is here said about the marriage of divorced persons; but the absolute indissolubility of the marriage bond was never held among the Jews, a certain laxity being allowed because of the hardness of their heart  (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>, etc.). The original intently of the marriage contract was re-established by Christ. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>16 The gift of a man maketh room for him,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bringeth him before the great.<p>That &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; may signify intellectual endowments, Hitzig supposes, but without any proof for such an opinion. Intellectual ability as the means of advancement is otherwise designated, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>. But Hitzig is right in this, that one mistakes the meaning of the proverb if he interprets &#1502;&#1514;&#1503; in the sense of &#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1491; (vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-8.htm">Proverbs 17:8</a>): mtn is an indifferent idea, and the proverb means that a man makes free space, a free path for himself, by a gift, i.e., by this, that he shows himself to be agreeable, pleasing where it avails, not niggardly but liberal. As a proverb expresses it:<p>Mit dem Hut in der Hand<p>Kommt man durchs ganze Land<p>[with hat in hand one goes through the whole land], so it is said here that such liberality brings before the great, i.e., not: furnishes with introductions to them; but helps to a place of honour near the great, i.e., those in a lofty position (cf. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>; &#1506;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/113-8.htm">Psalm 113:8</a>). It is an important part of practical wisdom, that by right liberality, i.e., by liberal giving where duty demands it, and prudence commends it, one does not lose but gains, does not descend but rises; it helps a man over the difficulties of limited, narrow circumstances, gains for him affection, and helps him up from step to step. The a&#772; of &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; is, in a singular way (cf. &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;), treated as unchangeable.</body></html>
