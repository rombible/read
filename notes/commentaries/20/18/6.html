The well-spring of wisdom in the heart of a believer, continually supplies words of wisdom. 5. The merits of a cause must be looked to, not the person. 6,7. What mischief bad men do to themselves by their ungoverned tongues! 8. How base are those that sow contention! and what fatal effects may be expected from small beginnings of jealousy! 9. Omissions of duty, and in duty, are fatal to the soul, as well as commissions of sin. 10,11. The Divine power, made known in and through our Lord Jesus Christ, forms a strong tower for the believer, who relies on the Lord. How deceitful the defence of the rich man, who has his portion and treasure in this world! It is a strong city and a high wall only in his own conceit; for it will fail when most in need. They will be exposed to the just wrath of that Judge whom they despised as a Saviour. 12. After the heart has been lifted up with pride, a fall comes. But honour shall be the reward of humility. 13. Eagerness, with self-conceit, will expose to shame. 14. Firmness of mind supports under many pains and trials. But when the conscience is tortured with remorse, no human fortitude can bear the misery; what then will hell be? 15. We must get knowledge, not only into our heads, but into our hearts. 16. Blessed be the Lord, who makes us welcome to come to his throne, without money and without price. May his gifts make room for him in our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The first verse speaks of the immediate, the others of the remote, results of the "fool's" temper.

That is, between others, when he has nothing to do with it; but he must be meddling, and make himself a party in the contention, which is an argument of his folly; he says things which occasion disputes, raise contentions among men, and provoke to wrath and anger. The Septuagint version is, "the lips of a fool lead him to evils": for, as they lead him to contention and strife, the issue of that is confusion and every evil work; <p>and his mouth calleth for strokes: as he stirs up and encourages contention, so he proceeds to blows, and excites others to them; from words he goes to blows, and, by the ill and provoking language of his mouth, gets many a blow to himself. Jarchi seems to understand it of chastisement, from the hand of God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-3.htm">Proverbs 26:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">enter into</span>] The Heb. may mean either “come into,” or “come with,” “bring” (R.V. marg.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">strokes</span>] Or, <span class="bld">stripes</span>, R.V., as the same Heb. word is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-29.htm" title="Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.">Proverbs 19:29</a>, the only other place in which it occurs. Some, however, take “calleth for” to mean “provokes,” “causes.” “Os ejus jurgia provocat,” Vulg.; “In causa est ut a verbis ad verbera veniatur,” Maur., which accords with “bring” contention, if that be adopted in the first clause.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A fool's lips enter into contention;</span> literally, <span class="accented">come with quarrel</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-13.htm">Psalm 66:13</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they lead him into strife and quarrels; <span class="accented">miscent se rixis</span>, Vulgate; "lead him into evils," Septuagint.

The Hiph. &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; means mutum agere (cf. Arab. khrs, mutum esse), from &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, which, like &#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, passes from the meaning surdus to that of mutus (Fl.). The words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-5.htm">Job 13:5</a>, and also those of Alexander: si tacuisses sapiens mansisses, are applicable to fools. An Arab. proverb says, "silence is the covering of the stupid."
