The ruler that uses his power aright, will find that to be his best security. 13. Put those in power who know how to speak to the purpose. 14,15. Those are fools, who, to obtain the favour of an earthly prince, throw themselves out of God's favour. 16. There is joy and satisfaction of spirit, only in getting wisdom. 17. A sincerely religious man keeps at a distance from every appearance of evil. Happy is the man that walks in Christ, and is led by the Spirit of Christ. 18. When men defy God's judgments, and think themselves far from them, it is a sign they are at the door. Let us not fear the pride of others, but fear pride in ourselves. 19. Humility, though it exposes to contempt in the world, is much better than high-spiritedness, which makes God an enemy. He that understands God's word shall find good. 21. The man whose wisdom dwells in his heart, will be found more truly prudent than many who possess shining talents. 22. As waters to a thirsty land, so is a wise man to his friends and neighbours. 23. The wise man's self-knowledge, always suggests something proper to be spoken to others. 24. The word of God cures the diseases that weaken our souls. 25. This is caution to all, to take heed of deceiving themselves as to their souls. 26.

When he looks with a pleasant smiling countenance on a person that has been under his displeasure, and especially if under a sentence of death, it is as life from the dead: so the light of the countenance of God, the King of kings; the discoveries of his love, the manifestations of himself, his gracious presence, communion with him, the comforts of his Spirit, the joys of his salvation, are life unto his people, invigorate their graces, quicken their souls, and make them cheerful; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>. And how delightful and pleasant is the countenance of Christ; which is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars; and is as the sun when it shineth in its strength; and who himself is the sun of righteousness, that arises on his people with healing in his wings! How reviving his love! how comfortable fellowship with him! his absence is as death, his presence gives life; <p>and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain: which falling a little before harvest, as was usual in Judea, revived the corn and filled it: and such is the favour of God in Christ, which is free, distinguishing, and undeserved, as rain is; the objects of it are very unworthy; and it is given often unasked for, as well as undeserved, in great abundance, and causes great cheerfulness and fruitfulness: and such is the layout of Christ, in coming into the world in the last days to save sinners his coming is said to be as the former and the latter rain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-3.htm">Hosea 6:3</a>. He came from heaven, as that does; is the free gift of God, as that is; is in consequence of a decree, as that; and came suddenly, and with great acceptance to those, who knew him and waited for him; and his spiritual coming unto his people, and the discoveries of his love and free favour to them, are very reviving, cheering, and refreshing; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the light of a king's countenance <i>is</i> life; and his favour <i>is</i> <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> as a cloud of the latter rain.</span><p>(i) Which is most comfortable to the dry ground.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">the latter rain</span>] i.e. the spring rain, which swelled and matured the corn for harvest, just as the “former” or autumn rain prepared the ground, after the drought of summer, for the sowing. Such a cloud was big with the double blessing of the fertilizing shower and the consequent harvest. Comp. the description by “The sweet Psalmist of Israel”:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“One that ruleth over men righteously,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That ruleth in the fear of God,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He shall be as the light of the morning when the sun riseth,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A morning without clouds;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>When the tender grass springeth out of the earth,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Through clear shining after rain.”—<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/23-3.htm" title="The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, He that rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God....">2 Samuel 23:3-4</a>, R.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And again:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As showers that water the earth.”—<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-6.htm" title="He shall come down like rain on the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.">Psalm 72:6</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the light of the king's countenance is life</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>). As the king's anger and the darkening of his countenance are death (ver. 14), so, when his look is cheerful and bright, it sheds joy and life around, as the rain refreshes the parched ground. <span class="cmt_word">A cloud of the latter rain</span>. The former rain in Palestine falls about the end of October or the beginning of November, when the seed is sown; the latter rain comes in March or April, and is absolutely necessary for the due swelling and ripening of the grain. It is accompanied, of course) with <span class="accented">cloud</span>, which tempers the heat, while it brings fertility and vigour. To this the king's <span class="accented">favour</span> is well compared. "He shall come down," says the psalmist, "like the rain upon the mown grass, as showers that water the earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-6.htm">Psalm 72:6</a>). The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">beni</span>) for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">peni</span>), translates, "In the light of life is the son of the king; and they who are acceptable to him are as a cloud of the latter rain." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>9 The heart of man deviseth his way;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But Jahve directeth his steps.<p>Similar to this is the German proverb: "Der Mensch denkt, Gott lenkt" [ equals  our "man proposes, God disposes"], and the Arabic el-&#8219;abd (&#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;  equals  man) judebbir wallah juk&#803;addir; Latin, homo proponit, Deus disponit; for, as Hitzig rightly remarks, 9b means, not that God maketh his steps firm (Venet., Luther, Umbreit, Bertheau, Elster), but that He gives direction to him (Jerome, dirigere). Man deliberates here and there (&#1495;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;, intens. of &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, to calculate, reflect) how he will begin and carry on this or that; but his short-sightedness leaves much out of view which God sees; his calculation does not comprehend many contingencies which God disposes of and man cannot foresee. The result and issue are thus of God, and the best is, that in all his deliberations one should give himself up without self-confidence and arrogance to the guidance of God, that one should do his duty and leave the rest, with humility and confidence, to God. </body></html>
