The observation of justice in commerce between man and man is likewise a divine appointment. He taught men discretion to make scales and weights, for the adjusting of right exactly between buyer and seller, that neither might be wronged. And all other useful inventions, for the preserving of right, are from him. He has also appointed, by his law, that men be just; it is, therefore, a great affront to him, and to his government, to falsify, and so to do wrong under colour and pretence of doing right, which is <span class="ital">wickedness in the place of judgment.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:4. God makes use of the wicked to execute righteous vengeance on each other; and he will be glorified by their destruction at last. 5. Though sinners strengthen themselves and one another, they shall not escape God's judgments. 6. By the mercy and truth of God in Christ Jesus, the sins of believers are taken away, and the power of sin is broken. 7. He that has all hearts in his hand, can make a man's enemies to be at peace with him. 8. A small estate, honestly come by, will turn to better account than a great estate ill-gotten. 9. If men make God's glory their end, and his will their rule, he will direct their steps by his Spirit and grace. 10. Let kings and judges of the earth be just, and rule in the fear of God. 11.

The great principles of truth end justice govern all the transactions of buying and selling; religion enters into the business of trading, and weights and measures are sacred things. Vulgate, "The weights and the balance are judgments of the Lord;" being true and fair, they are regarded as God's judgment. Septuagint, "The turn of the balance is justice before God." <span class="cmt_word">All the weights of the bag are his work.</span> Some have round a difficulty here, because the bag may contain false as well as true weights (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13</a>), and it could not be said that the light weights were the Lord's work. This surely is captious criticism. The maxim merely states that the trader's weights take their origin and authority from God's enactment, from certain eternal principles which he has established. What man's chicanery and fraud make of them does not come into view. (For the law that regulates such matters, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35</a>, etc.) That cheating in this respect was not uncommon we learn from the complaints of the prophets, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>. The religious character of the standard weights and measures is shown by the term "shekel of the sanctuary" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24</a>, and elsewhere continually). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Here follow three proverbs of divine punishment, expiatio [Vershnung] and reconciliatio [Vershnung].<p>5 An abomination of Jahve is every one who is haughty;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The hand for it [assuredly] he remains not unpunished.<p>Proverbs thus commencing we already had at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-9.htm">Proverbs 15:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-26.htm">Proverbs 15:26</a>. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; is a metaplastic connecting form of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;; on the contrary, &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/103-11.htm">Psalm 103:11</a>, means being high, as &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, height; the form underlying &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; is not &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468; (as Gesen. and Olshausen write it), but &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;.
