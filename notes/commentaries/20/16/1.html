The sense of these words, according to our version, depends upon the next clause, and the meaning of the whole is, that a man can neither think nor speak without God: the "orderings" or "marshallings of the heart" (a), as it may be rendered; that is, of the thoughts of the heart, which are generally irregular and confused; the ranging them in order, as an army in battle array, or as things regularly placed on a well furnished table; the fixing them on any particular subject, though about things civil and natural, so as closely to attend to them, and proceed in a regular manner in the consideration of them, are not without the concurrence of divine Providence: and whereas the thoughts of men's hearts are evil, and that continually, and nothing but evil thoughts naturally proceed from thence; the ordering and marshalling of them, and fixing them to the attention and consideration of divine and spiritual things, are not without the supernatural grace of God; for we cannot think a good thought of ourselves, nor indeed anything of ourselves in a spiritual manner, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>; all preparations for religious service and duty, whether it be to pray unto God, or to preach in his name, are from the Lord; it is he that works in men both "to will and to do"; that gives them the willing mind, or a suitable frame for service, as well as ability to perform it; that pours out the Spirit of grace and supplication on them, and disposes and directs their minds to proper petitions, and furnishes his ministering servants in their studies with agreeable matter for their ministrations, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-17.htm">Psalm 10:17</a>; <p>and the answer of the tongue is from the Lord; who made man's mouth, and teaches him what to say, both before God and man; what he shall say in prayer to him, or in preaching to others; for the "door of utterance" in either service is from him, as well as the preparation for it: most versions and interpreters make these clauses distinct, the one as belonging to men, the other to God; thus, "to men belong the preparations of the heart, but from the Lord is the answer" or "speech of the tongue"; the former is said by way of concession, and according to the opinion of men; and the sense may be, be it so, that man has the marshalling and ordering of his own thoughts, and that he can lay things together in his mind, and think pertinently and properly on a subject, and is capable of preparing matter for a discourse; yet it is as easy to observe, that men can better form ideas of things in their minds, the they can express their sense and meaning; and though they may be ever so well prepared to speak, yet they are not able to do it, unless the Lord gives them utterance, and assists their memories; they lose what they had prepared, or deliver it in a disorderly and confused manner, and sometimes think to say one thing, and say another; their tongues are overruled by the Lord to say what they never intended, as in the cases of Balaam and Caiaphas.

And the implied moral of the proverb is, If you cannot do the less without God, do not attempt to do the greater without Him; “In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/3-5.htm" title="Trust in the LORD with all your heart; and lean not to your own understanding....">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.

It is better translated, <span class="accented">The plans of the heart are man's</span>: <span class="accented">but the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah.</span> Men make plans, arrange speeches, muster arguments, in the mind; but to put these into proper, persuasive words is a gift of God. "Our sufficiency is of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>). In the case of Balaam, God overruled the wishes and intentions of the prophet, and constrained him to give utterance to something very different from his original mental conceptions. But the present sentence attributes the outward expression of what the mind has conceived in every case unto the help of God (comp. vers. 9, 33; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>). Christ enjoined his disciples to trust to momentary inspiration in their apologies or defences before unbelievers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>). This verse is omitted in the Septuagint. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Two proverbs regarding the righteous and the wicked:<p>28 The heart of the righteous considereth how to answer right,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the mouth of the godless poureth forth evil.<p>Instead of &#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, the lxx (Syr. and Targ.) imagines &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;; Jerome translates, but falsely, obedientiam (from &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, to bend oneself); Meri thinks on &#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, wormwood, for the heart of the righteous revolves in itself the misery and the vanity of this present life; Hitzig corrects this verse as he does the three preceding: the heart of the righteous thinks on &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1493;&#1514;, a plur. of verb &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;, which, except in this correction, does not exist. The proverb, as it stands, is, in fineness of expression and sharpness of the contrast, raised above such manglings. Instead of the righteous, the wise might be named, and instead of the godless, fools (cf. 2b); but the poet places the proverb here under the point of view of duty to neighbours. It is the characteristic of the righteous that he does not give the reins to his tongue; but as Luther has translated: the heart of the righteous considers [tichtet from dictare, frequently to speak, here carefully to think over] what is to be answered, or rather, since &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is not used, he thinks thereupon to answer rightly, for that the word &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is used in this pregnant sense is seen from 23a. The godless, on the contrary, are just as rash with their mouth as the righteous are of a thoughtful heart: their mouth sputters forth (effutit) evil, for they do not first lay to heart the question what may be right and just in the case that has arisen. </body></html>
