Or "divination" (f), as the word signifies; or what is like to divination, as Aben Ezra and Gersom interpret it (g). What be says is as an oracle, and should be strictly true. Some understand it of the sagacity and penetration of kings, as was in Solomon, and appeared in his judging the two harlots; but such is not to be found in kings in common: rather therefore this expresses and designs what should be, and not what is, in kings. These, as the kings of Israel, ought to have the book of God before them, and read in it, and judge and pronounce sentence in every case according to it; they should speak as the oracles of God; and, when they do, a divine sentence may be said to be in their lips. But it is best to understand this of the King of kings, of the King Messiah; into whose lips grace is poured, and from whence none but words of wisdom, grace, and truth, flow; who taught the way of God in truth; who had the word of God in his heart and in his month continually; and on whom the Spirit of wisdom without measure dwelt; and is the wisdom and word of God, as well as the power of God; <p>his mouth transgresseth not in judgment; this cannot be said of any earthly king; they ought not indeed to transgress in judgment with their mouths, but it is notorious that they too often do: could this be applied to kings in common, they would have a better claim to infallibility than the pope of Rome has. But this is true of Christ, the King of saints; who is a King that reigns in righteousness, and decrees judgment; sits upon his throne, to order and establish it with judgment: nor does his mouth ever transgress in judgment, or ever say, or he do, a wrong thing; his sceptre is a sceptre of righteousness. <p>(f) "divinatio", V.

The king's words have, in people's minds, the certainty and importance of a Divine oracle, putting an end to all controversy or division of opinion. It seems to be a general maxim, not especially referring to Solomon or the theocratic kingdom, but rather indicating the traditional view of the absolute monarchy. The custom of deifying kings and invoking them as gods was usual in Egypt and Eastern countries, and made its way to the West. "It is the voice of a god, and not of a man," cried the people, when Herod addressed them in the amphitheatre at Caesarea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-22.htm">Acts 12:22</a>). The Greeks could say - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"God's very living image is the king."</span> And thus his utterances were regarded as irrefragably true and decisive. <span class="cmt_word">His month transgresseth not in judgment.</span> The decisions which he gives are infallible, and, at any rate, irresistible. We may refer to Solomon's famous verdict concerning the two mothers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>, etc.), and such sentences as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15</a>, "By me (wisdom) kings reign, and princes decree justice" (see below on ver. 12; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>); and David's words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>), "He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God" (Wisd. 9:4, 10, 12). Delitzsch regards the second hemistich as giving a warning (consequent on the former clause), and not stating a fact, "In the judgment his mouth should not err." The present chapter contains many admonitions to kings which a wise father like Solomon may have uttered and recorded for the benefit of his son. If this is the case, it is as strange as it is true that Rehoboam made little use of the counsels, and that Solomon's latter days gave the lie to many of them.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>4 Jahve hath made everything for its contemplated end;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And also the wicked for the day of evil.<p>Everywhere else &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; means answer (Venet. &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;), which is not suitable here, especially with the absoluteness of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;; the Syr. and Targ. translate, obedientibus ei, which the words do not warrant; but also propter semet ipsum (Jerome, Theodotion, Luther) give to 4b no right parallelism, and, besides, would demand &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1493; or &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;. The punctuation &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, which is an anomaly (cf. &#1499;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a>, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-14.htm">Ezra 10:14</a>), shows (Ewald) that here we have, not the prepositional &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, but &#1500; with the subst. &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, which in derivation and meaning is one with the form &#1502;&#1506;&#1494; abbreviated from it (cf. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;), similar in meaning to the Arab. ma'anyn, aim, intention, object, and end, and mind, from 'atay, to place opposite to oneself a matter, to make it the object of effort. Hitzig prefers &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, but why not rather &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, for the proverb is not intended to express that all that God has made serve a purpose (by which one is reminded of the arguments for the existence of God from final causes, which are often prosecuted too far), but that all is made by God for its purpose, i.e., a purpose premeditated by Him, that the world of things and of events stands under the law of a plan, which has in God its ground and its end, and that also the wickedness of free agents is comprehended in this plan, and made subordinate to it. God has not indeed made the wicked as such, but He has made the being which is capable of wickedness, and which has decided for it, viz., in view of the "day of adversity" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>), which God will cause to come upon him, thus making His holiness manifest in the merited punishment, and thus also making wickedness the means of manifesting His glory. It is the same thought which is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a> with reference to Pharaoh. A praedestinatio ad malum, and that in the supralapsarian sense, cannot be here taught, for this horrible dogma (horribile quidem decretrum, fateor, says Calvin himself) makes God the author of evil, and a ruler according to His sovereign caprice, and thus destroys all pure conceptions of God. What Paul, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9.htm">Romans 9</a>, with reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>, wishes to say is this, that it was not Pharaoh's conduct that determined the will of God, but that the will of God is always the antecedens: nothing happens to God through the obstinacy and rebellion of man which determines Him to an action not already embraced in the eternal plan, but also such an one must against his will be subservient to the display of God's glory. The apostle adds <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>, and shows that he recognised the factor of human self-determination, but also as one comprehended in God's plan. The free actions of men create no situation by which God would be surprised and compelled to something which was not originally intended by Himself. That is what the above proverb says: the wicked also has his place in God's order of the world. Whoever frustrates the designs of grace must serve God in this, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>). </body></html>
