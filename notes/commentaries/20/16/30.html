Ungodly men bestow more pains to do mischief than would be needful to do good. The whisperer separates friends: what a hateful, but how common a character! 29,30. Some do all the mischief they can by force and violence, and are blind to the result. 31. Old people especially should be found in the way of religion and godliness. 32. To overcome our own passions, requires more steady management, than obtaining victory over an enemy. 33. All the disposal of Providence concerning our affairs, we must look upon to be the determining what we referred to God; and we must be reconciled to them accordingly.

Or "perverse" or "contrary things" (r); he shuts his eyes, that his thoughts might not be disturbed and distracted by visible objects, but might be more free and composed, and intent upon the things he is meditating and devising; or he shuts his eyes against light, against Scripture evidence, which he does not care to come to, lest his principles and practices should be reproved; he shuts his eyes, and will not look into the Scriptures, that he may form and devise schemes of doctrine and worship contrary to them. Some render it, he winks with his eyes, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>; so the Targum; he gives the hint thereby to his companions, when is the proper time to circumvent an innocent person, and to put in execution the scheme he had devised; <p>moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass; either as persons in deep thought used to do; or as a token to others to set about the evil designed and contrived; or rather as acting a deceitful part, as a false teacher; not speaking out his mind freely, but muttering out his words, handling the word of God deceitfully, and not by manifestation of the truth commending himself to every man's conscience in the sight of God, as a faithful minister does; and by such artful methods brings his evil designs to pass. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "biting his lips"; so a wicked man does through indignation at a good man, and through desire of revenge; and when he plots against him, he gnashes at him with his teeth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12</a>. The Targum is, <p>"threatening with his lips;'' <p>he gives out menaces of evil things, and performs them; which is true of the man of sin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a>. <p>(r) "perversitates", Pagninus, Montanus, Baynus, Mercerus, Gejerus; "res perversas", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "perversa", Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{n}</span> He shutteth his eyes to devise perverse things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.</span><p>(n) With his whole endeavour he labours to bring his wickedness to pass.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="ital">shutteth</span>] Or, <span class="ital">fixeth</span>, or <span class="ital">setteth firmly</span>, <span class="greekheb">στηρίζων</span>, LXX.

From such a crafty, malignant man you need not expect any more open tokens of his intentions. <span class="cmt_word">He shutteth his eyes</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>); either that he may better think out his evil plans, or else he cannot look his neighbour in the face while he is plotting against him. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">attonitis oculis</span>; Septuagint, "fixing (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) his eyes." <span class="cmt_word">Moving his lips;</span> rather, <span class="accented">he who compresseth his lips</span>, to hide the malignant smile with which he might greet his neighbour's calamity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13</a>, etc.; Proverbs 10:10), or that neither by word nor expression he may betray his thoughts. Others take the two outward expressions mentioned as signals to confederates; but this is not so suitable, as they are the man's own feelings and sentiments that are meant. One who gives these tokens <span class="cmt_word">bringeth evil to pass;</span> he has perfected his designs, and deems them as good as accomplished, and you will do well to note what his bearing signifies. Some take the meaning to be, brings punishment on himself; but the warning is not given for the sinner's sake. Septuagint, "He defines (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) all evils with his lips; he is a furnace of evil." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>24 A honeycomb are pleasant words,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet to the soul, and healing to the bones.<p>Honeycomb, i.e., honey flowing from the &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, the comb or cell (favus), is otherwise designated, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a>. &#1502;&#1514;&#1493;&#1511;, with &#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;, is neut. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1504;&#1506;&#1501; are, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-26.htm">Proverbs 15:26</a>, words which love suggests, and which breathe love.
