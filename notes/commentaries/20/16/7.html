God makes use of the wicked to execute righteous vengeance on each other; and he will be glorified by their destruction at last. 5. Though sinners strengthen themselves and one another, they shall not escape God's judgments. 6. By the mercy and truth of God in Christ Jesus, the sins of believers are taken away, and the power of sin is broken. 7. He that has all hearts in his hand, can make a man's enemies to be at peace with him. 8. A small estate, honestly come by, will turn to better account than a great estate ill-gotten. 9. If men make God's glory their end, and his will their rule, he will direct their steps by his Spirit and grace. 10. Let kings and judges of the earth be just, and rule in the fear of God. 11.

As they do when a man walks according to the rule of his word; when he walks as he has Christ for an example; when he walks after the Spirit, and not after the flesh; when he walks by faith, and does all he does in faith; without which it is impossible to please God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>; and when all his ways and actions are directed to the glory of God; <p>he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him; as Abimelech with Isaac, Esau with Jacob; and the enemies of the church and people of God with then, in the latter day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When a man's ways please the Lord,</span> which they can do only when they are religious, just, and charitable. <span class="cmt_word">He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him;</span> to submit themselves. Experience proves that nothing succeeds like success. Where a man is prosperous and things go well with him, even ill-wishers are content to east away or to dissemble their dislike, and to live at peace with him. Thus Abimelech King of Gerar fawned upon Isaac because he saw that the Lord was with him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-27.htm">Genesis 26:27</a>, etc.). This is the worldly side of the maxim. It has a higher aspect, and intimates the far reaching influence of goodness - how it disarms opposition, arouses reverence and love, gives no occasion for disputes, and spreads around an atmosphere of peace. To the Jews the maxim was taught by external circumstances. While they were doing the will of the Lord, their land was to be preserved from hostile attack (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-24.htm">Exodus 34:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-10.htm">2 Chronicles 17:10</a>). And Christians learn that it is only when they obey and fear God that they can overcome the assaults of the enemies of their soul - the devil, the world, and the flesh Talmud, "He who is agreeable to God is equally agreeable to men." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Four proverbs of God, the disposer of all things:<p>1 Man's are the counsels of the heart;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the answer of the tongue cometh from Jahve.<p>Gesen., Ewald, and Bertheau incorrectly understand 1b of hearing, i.e., of a favourable response to what the tongue wishes; 1a speaks not of wishes, and the gen. after &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; (answer) is, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>, and also here, by virtue of the parallelism, the gen. subjecti <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a> leads to the right sense, according to which a good answer is joy to him to whom it refers: it does not always happen to one to find the fitting and effective expression for that which he has in his mind; it is, as this cog. proverb expresses it, a gift from above (&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>). But now, since &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; neither means answering, nor yet in general an expression (Euchel) or report (Lwenstein), and the meaning of the word at 4a is not here in question, one has to think of him whom the proverb has in view as one who has to give a reason, to give information, or generally - since &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, like &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, is not confined to the interchange of words - to solve a problem, and that such an one as requires reflection. The scheme (project, premeditation) which he in his heart contrives, is here described as &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1498;, to arrange, to place together, metaphorically of the reflection, i.e., the consideration analyzing and putting a matter in order. These reflections, seeking at one time in one direction, and at another in another, the solution of the question, the unfolding of the problem, are the business of men; but the answer which finally the tongue gives, and which here, in conformity with the pregnant sense of &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; (vid., at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-28.htm">Proverbs 15:28</a>), will be regarded as right, appropriate, effective, thus generally the satisfying reply to the demand placed before him, is from God. It is a matter of experience which the preacher, the public speaker, the author, and every man to whom his calling or circumstances present a weighty, difficult theme, can attest. As the thoughts pursue one another in the mind, attempts are made, and again abandoned; the state of the heart is somewhat like that of chaos before the creation. But when, finally, the right thought and the right utterance for it are found, that which is found appears to us, not as if self-discovered, but as a gift; we regard it with the feeling that a higher power has influenced our thoughts and imaginings; the confession by us, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-5.htm">2 Corinthians 3:5</a>), in so far as we believe in a living God, is inevitable. </body></html>
