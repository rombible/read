Mercy and truth cannot, of course, in themselves “purge iniquity,” only so far as they are signs of the “faith which worketh by love” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>), which accepts the salvation offered by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-16.htm" title="For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.">Romans 1:16-17</a>).

Hereby also a principle of mercy and truth is implanted in us, by which the power of sin is broken, and our corrupt inclinations are mortified and destroyed. In this way, and not by any legal sacrifices, or ceremonial observances, such as those on which the hypocritical Jews depended for the expiation of their sins, is <span class="ital">iniquity purged, </span>and the sinner both pardoned and renewed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/6-7.htm" title="Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?...">Micah 6:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm" title="For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-13.htm" title="But go you and learn what that means, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.">Matthew 9:13</a>. <span class="ital">And by the fear of the Lord — </span>By a filial reverence toward God, and by a holy fear of offending him; <span class="ital">men depart from evil — </span>They are kept from abusing pardoning mercy, and from returning to folly or wickedness.

Or "expiated" (d), and atoned for: not by the mercy and truth of men; not by alms deeds or showing mercy to the poor; nor by speaking truth and keeping promises, and doing justice between man and man; for, though these are duties to be performed, they will not atone for sin; and may be done by persons destitute of the grace of God, and whose iniquities are not purged or pardoned: but by the mercy and truth of God; through his "mercy", in sending Christ to be the propitiation for sin; and through his "truth", in fulfilling his promises concerning Christ; and particularly concerning pardon on the foot of his sacrifice and satisfaction, where mercy and truth have met together: or through the grace and truth come by Jesus Christ; or through his atoning sacrifice, by which he has finished transgression, made an end of sin, and made reconciliation for iniquity; in which there is a rich display of his own and of his father's grace and mercy, truth and faithfulness; <p>and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil; having that put into their hearts, and excited and influenced by the grace and goodness of God, men are engaged to abstain from evil, and the appearance of it; it teaches them to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly and godly in this world. <p>(d) "expiabitur", Montanus, Vatablus; "expiatur", Tigurine version, Mercerus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Gejerus, Michaelis, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">By <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD <i>men</i> depart from evil.</span><p>(d) Their upright and repenting life will be a token that their sins are forgiven.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">By mercy and truth iniquity is purged</span>] This is not a statement of the method and ground of atonement, though the Heb. word here rendered <span class="ital">purged</span> is the usual word in the O.T. for <span class="ital">covering</span>, or <span class="ital">atoning for</span>, sin. That is taught elsewhere both in the Old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-7.htm" title="Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.">Psalm 51:7</a>), and in the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin....">Romans 3:20-26</a>). But it is a lifting of man’s appropriation of atonement out of the ceremonial and ritual into the moral sphere of action. Not by sacrifices as its purchase-money, but by a new life as its seal, is the free gift of atonement realised and assured.

It is by the exercise of those graces, not by mere external rites, that God is propitiated (see on Proverbs 10:2). A kind of expiatory value is assigned to these virtues, which, indeed, must not be pressed too closely, but should be examined by the light of such passages in the New Testament as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-41.htm">Luke 11:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>. Of course, such graces show themselves only in one who is really devout and God fearing; they are the fruits of a heart at peace with God and man, and react on the character and conduct. The LXX., which places this distich after ver. 27 of ch. 15, translates, "By alms and faithfulness (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) sins are cleansed," confining the term "mercy" to one special form, as in one reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6</a>. l, "Take heed that ye do not your righteousness [<span class="accented">al.</span> alms] before men." <span class="cmt_word">By the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</span> The practice of true religion, of course, involves abstinence from sin; and this seems so unnecessary a truth to be formally stated  that some take the "evil" named to be physical, not moral evil; calamity, not transgression. But the two clauses are coordinate, and present two aspects of the same truth. The first intimates how sin is to be expiated, the second how it is to be avoided. The morally good man meets with pardon and acceptance, and he who fears God is delivered from evil. So we pray, in the Lord's Prayer, "Forgive us our trespasses, and deliver us from evil." Septuagint, "By the fear of the Lord every one declineth from evil" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>33 The fear of Jahve is a discipline to wisdom,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And before honour is humility.<p>We may regard '&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492; (the fear of Jahve) also as pred. here. The fear of Jahve is an educational maxim, and the end of education of the Chokma; but the phrase may also be the subject, and by such a rendering Luther's parallelism lies nearer: "The fear of the Lord is discipline to wisdom;" the fear of God, viz., continually exercised and tried, is the right school of wisdom, and humility is the right way to honour. Similar is the connection &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, discipline binds understanding to itself as its consequence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a>. Line second repeats itself, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-12.htm">Proverbs 18:12</a>, "Pride comes before the fall." Luther's "And ere one comes to honour, he must previously suffer," renders &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; rather than &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492;. But the Syr. reverses the idea: the honour of the humble goeth before him, as also one of the anonymous Greek versions: &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;. But the &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1; comes, as the above proverb expresses it, afterwards. The way to the height lies through the depth, the depth of humility under the hand of God, and, as &#1506;&#1504;&#1493;&#1492; expresses, of self-humiliation. </body></html>
