Ungodly men bestow more pains to do mischief than would be needful to do good. The whisperer separates friends: what a hateful, but how common a character! 29,30. Some do all the mischief they can by force and violence, and are blind to the result. 31. Old people especially should be found in the way of religion and godliness. 32. To overcome our own passions, requires more steady management, than obtaining victory over an enemy. 33. All the disposal of Providence concerning our affairs, we must look upon to be the determining what we referred to God; and we must be reconciled to them accordingly.

Whoever is wise of heart, i.e., of mind or spirit (&#1500;&#1489;  equals  the N.T. &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; or &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;), is called, and is truly, &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1503; [learned, intelligent] (Fleischer compares to this the expression frequent in Isaiah, "to be named"  equals  to be and appear to be, the Arab. du'ay lah); but there is a gift which highly increases the worth of this understanding or intelligence, for it makes it fruitful of good to others, and that is grace of the lips. On the lips (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-13.htm">Proverbs 10:13</a>) of the intelligent wisdom is found; but the form also, and the whole manner and way in which he gives expression to this wisdom, is pleasing, proceeding from a deep and tender feeling for the suitable and the beneficial, and thus he produces effects so much the more surely, and beneficently, and richly. </body></html>
