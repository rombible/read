God makes use of the wicked to execute righteous vengeance on each other; and he will be glorified by their destruction at last. 5. Though sinners strengthen themselves and one another, they shall not escape God's judgments. 6. By the mercy and truth of God in Christ Jesus, the sins of believers are taken away, and the power of sin is broken. 7. He that has all hearts in his hand, can make a man's enemies to be at peace with him. 8. A small estate, honestly come by, will turn to better account than a great estate ill-gotten. 9. If men make God's glory their end, and his will their rule, he will direct their steps by his Spirit and grace. 10. Let kings and judges of the earth be just, and rule in the fear of God. 11.

Gotten in a righteous way, held by a righteous claim, used in a righteous manner, attended with a life of righteousness and holiness; and also along with an interest in the righteousness of Christ, which renders acceptable unto God, yields peace and comfort, and entitles to eternal glory and happiness. A truly righteous man may have but little of this world's goods; but his small pittance is better <p>than great revenues without right; obtained in an unjust way; detained from the right owner of them, and used in an unrighteous manner, in a course of sin and wickedness: or, "without judgment" (e); how to make use of them aright, and without a righteousness that will justify them at the day of judgment; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16</a>. A little the true church of Christ enjoys in the wilderness; having Christ and his grace, Christ and his righteousness, is better than all the revenues of the church of Rome gotten by the unlawful methods they are; and which, in one hour will come to nought, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-17.htm">Revelation 18:17</a>. <p>(e)  "absque judicio", Pagninus, Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">without right</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">with injustice</span>, R.V., as preserving better the parallelism.

For the rest, cf. with 2a, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>, where, instead of the subj. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, is used &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, and with 2b, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>, where God is described by &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;. The verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; is a secondary formation from &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; (vid., Hupfeld on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7</a>), like &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; from Arab. tyak&#803;n (to be fast, sure), the former through the medium of the reflex. &#1492;&#1514;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;, the latter of the reflex. Arab. a&#770;itk&#803;n; &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; means to regulate (from regula, a rule), to measure off, to weigh, here not to bring into a condition right according to rule (Theodotion, &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, stabiliens, Syr. Targ. &#1502;&#1514;&#1511;&#1468;&#1503;, Venet. &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;; Luther, "but the Lord maketh the heart sure"), but to measure or weigh, and therefore to estimate rightly, to know accurately (Jerome, spiritum ponderator est Dominus). The judgment of a man regarding the cause of life, which it is good for him to enter upon, lies exposed to great and subtle self-deception; but God has the measure and weight, i.e., the means of proving, so as to value the spirits according to their true moral worth; his investigation goes to the root (cf. &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>), his judgment rests on the knowledge of the true state of the matter, and excludes all deception, so that thus a man can escape the danger of delusion by no other means than by placing his way, i.e., his external and internal life, in the light of the word of God, and desiring for himself the all-penetrating test of the Searcher of hearts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23</a>.), and the self-knowledge corresponding to the result of this test. </body></html>
