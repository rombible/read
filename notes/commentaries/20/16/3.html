But is it true what Hitzig says in justification of his correction, that &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; never means light, or ray, or brightness, but lamp (&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;)? It is true, indeed, that &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; cannot mean a cheerful sight (Luther) in an objective sense (lxx &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;), as a verdant garden or a stream flowing through a landscape (Rashi), for that would be &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, and "brightness which the eyes see" (Bertheau); the genitive connection certainly does not mean: the &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; is not the light from without presenting itself to the eyes, but, like &#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a>) and similar expressions, the light of the eye itself [bright or joyous eyes]. But &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; does not mean alone the body of light, but also the illumination, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-14.htm">Exodus 35:14</a> and elsewhere, not only that which (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;, &#x3c4;&#x3b9;) gives light, but also this, that (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;) light arises and is present, so that we might translate it here as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/90-8.htm">Psalm 90:8</a>, either the brightness, or that which gives light. But the clear brightness of one's own eye cannot be meant, for then that were as much as to say that it is the effect, not that it is the cause, of a happy heart, but the brightness of the eyes of others that meet us. That this gladdens the heart of him who has a sight of it is evident, without any interchanging relation of the joy-beaming countenance, for it is indeed heart-gladdening to a man, to whom selfishness has not made the &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; impossible, to see a countenance right joyful in truth. But in connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a>, it lies nearer to think on a love-beaming countenance, a countenance on which joyful love to us mirrors itself, and which reflects itself in our heart, communicating this sense of gladness. The ancient Jewish interpreters understand &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1512; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; of the enlightening of the eye of the mind, according to which Euchel translates: "clear intelligence;" but Rashi has remarked that that is not the explanation of the words, but the Midrash. That, in line second of this synonymous distich, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; does not mean alloquium humanum (Fl.), nor a good report which one hears of himself, but a good message, is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-25.htm">Proverbs 25:25</a>; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; as neut. part. pass. may mean that which is heard, but the comparison of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492;, stamps it as an abstract formation like &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; (&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;), according to which the lxx translates it by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#769; (in this passage by &#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;).
