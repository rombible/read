Ungodly men bestow more pains to do mischief than would be needful to do good. The whisperer separates friends: what a hateful, but how common a character! 29,30. Some do all the mischief they can by force and violence, and are blind to the result. 31. Old people especially should be found in the way of religion and godliness. 32. To overcome our own passions, requires more steady management, than obtaining victory over an enemy. 33. All the disposal of Providence concerning our affairs, we must look upon to be the determining what we referred to God; and we must be reconciled to them accordingly.

Of a man's garment, or into his bosom, or into a hat, cap, urn, or whatsoever he has in his lap, and from whence it is taken out; which used to be done in choosing officers, civil or ecclesiastical; in dividing inheritances, and determining doubtful cases; and making up differences, and putting an end to strife and contentions, which otherwise could not be done: and this ought not to be used in trivial cases, or to gratify curiosity, or for the sake of gain, or rashly and superstitiously; but seriously and religiously, with prayer, and in faith, and with a view to the divine direction, and submission to it; for a lot has the nature of an oath, and is an appeal to the omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent Being; <p>but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord; or "the judgment" (u) of it; the judgment that is to be made by it concerning persons or things; it being so directed and ordered by him as to fall upon the person it should; or to make known the thing in doubt and debate according to his will, in which all parties concerned should acquiesce. This is to be ascribed, not to blind chance and fortune, to the influence of the stars, or to any invisible created being, angel or devil, but to the Lord only; there is no such thing as chance, or events by chance; those events which seem most fortuitous or contingent are all disposed, ordered, and governed, by the sovereign will of God. <p>(u) "judicium ejus", Pagninus, Montanus, Mercerus, Cocceius, Gejerus, Schultens; "judicium eorum", Tigurine version. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The lot is cast into the lap; but its whole disposing <i>is</i> <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> from the LORD.</span><p>(p) So that there is nothing that ought to be attributed to fortune: for all things are determined in the counsel of God which will come to pass.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>. <span class="ital">the lap</span>] from the folds of which it was drawn or shaken out.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">disposing</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">judgement</span>. The decision, which when appealed to as arbiter it pronounces, is not its own but Jehovah’s.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The religion of the O.T. incorporated into itself the use of the lot as it did many other common customs (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/7-14.htm" title="In the morning therefore you shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD takes shall come according to the families thereof; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man....">Joshua 7:14-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-42.htm" title="And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.">1 Samuel 14:42</a>). With the gift of Pentecost, however, the religious use of it appears to have ceased. No mention is found of it in the N.T. after <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-26.htm" title="And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.">Acts 1:26</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lot is cast into the lap.</span> The bosom or fold of the garment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-14.htm">Proverbs 21:14</a>). It is not quite clear what articles the Jews used in their divinations by lot. Probably they employed stones, differing in shape or colour, or having some distinguishing mark. These were placed in a vessel or in the fold of a garment, and drawn or shaken thence. Such a practice has been common in all ages and countries; and though only cursorily mentioned in the Mosaic legislation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>), it was used by the Jews from the time of Joshua, and in the earliest days of the Christian Church (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>:28, etc.). As by this means man's agency was minimized, and all partiality and chicanery were excluded, the decision was regarded as directed by Providence. There is one case only of ordeal in the Law, and that under suspicion of adultery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-12.htm">Numbers 5:12</a>, etc.). In the Epistle to the Hebrews, in place of the lot we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>), "An oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife." <span class="cmt_word">The whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.</span> In these cases the Jew learned to see, in what we call chance, the overruling of Divine power. But this was not blind superstition. He did not feel justified in resorting to this practice on every trivial occasion, as persons used the <span class="accented">Sortes Virgilianae</span> or even the verses of the Bible for the same purpose. The lot was employed religiously in cases where other means of decision were not suitable or available; it was not to supersede common prudence or careful investigation; but, for example, in trials where the evidence was conflicting and the judges could not determine the case, the merits were ascer-rained by lot (comp. ch. 18:18). After the effusion of the Holy Spirit, the apostles never resorted to divination, and the Christian Church has wisely repudiated the practice of all such modes of discovering the Divine will. Septuagint, "For the unrighteous all things fall into their bosom, but from the Lord are all just things," which may mean either that, though the wicked seem to prosper, God still works out his righteous ends; or the evil suffer retribution, and thus God's justice is displayed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>27 A worthless man diggeth evil;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And on his lips is, as it were, scorching fire.<p>Regarding &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12</a>, and regarding &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, to dig round, or to bore out, vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-5.htm">Genesis 50:5</a>; here the figure, "to dig for others a pit," <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a>, etc.: to dig evil is equivalent to, to seek to prepare such for others. &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;&#1514; Kimchi rightly explains as a form similar to &#1511;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;; as a subst. it means, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-23.htm">Leviticus 13:23</a>, the mark of fire (the healed mark of a carbuncle), here as an adj. of a fire, although not flaming (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1492;&#1489;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>, etc.); yet so much the hotter, and scorching everything that comes near to it (from &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;, to be scorched, cogn. &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1489;, to which also &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1507; is perhaps related as a stronger power, like comburere to adurere).
