God makes use of the wicked to execute righteous vengeance on each other; and he will be glorified by their destruction at last. 5. Though sinners strengthen themselves and one another, they shall not escape God's judgments. 6. By the mercy and truth of God in Christ Jesus, the sins of believers are taken away, and the power of sin is broken. 7. He that has all hearts in his hand, can make a man's enemies to be at peace with him. 8. A small estate, honestly come by, will turn to better account than a great estate ill-gotten. 9. If men make God's glory their end, and his will their rule, he will direct their steps by his Spirit and grace. 10. Let kings and judges of the earth be just, and rule in the fear of God. 11.

"Man proposes, God disposes" or, as the Germans say, "Der Mensch denkt, Gott lenkt" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24</a>). The word rendered "deviseth" implies, by its spectra, intensity of thought and care. Man meditates and prepares his plans with the utmost solicitude, but it rests with God whether he shall carry them to completion or not, and whether, if they are to be accomplished, it be done with ease or with painful labour (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-12.htm">Genesis 24:12</a>, etc.). We all remember Shakespeare's words in 'Hamlet' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"There's a divinity that shapes our ends,<br />Rough-hew them how we will."</span> Septuagint, "Let the heart of man consider what is just, that his steps may be by God directed might" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>3 Roll on Jahve thy works,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; So thy thoughts shall prosper.<p>The proverbs P<a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1-3</a> are wanting in the lxx; their absence is compensated for by three others, but only externally, not according to their worth.

We should roll on God all matters which, as obligations, burden us, and on account of their weight and difficulty cause us great anxiety, for nothing is too heavy or too hard for Him who can overcome all difficulties and dissolve all perplexities; then will our thoughts, viz., those about the future of our duty and our life-course, be happy, nothing will remain entangled and be a failure, but will be accomplished, and the end and aim be realized. </body></html>
