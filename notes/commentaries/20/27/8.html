There may be occasion for us to justify ourselves, but not to praise ourselves. 3,4. Those who have no command of their passions, sink under the load. 5,6. Plain and faithful rebukes are better, not only than secret hatred, but than love which compliments in sin, to the hurt of the soul. 7. The poor have a better relish of their enjoyments, and are often more thankful for them, than the rich. In like manner the proud and self-sufficient disdain the gospel; but those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, find comfort from the meanest book or sermon that testifies of Christ Jesus. 8.

It is not easy for the man to find another home or the bird another nest.

But the idea here is of a bird which leaves its own nest either wantonly or from some external reason, and thereby exposes itself to d so comfort and danger (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So is a man that wandereth from his place</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. his own home (comp. Ecclus. 29:21, etc., and 36:28 in Vet. Lat., "Quis credit ei qui non habet nidum, et deflectens  ubicumque obscuraverit, quasi succinctus latro exsil ins de civitate in civitatem?"). The proverb indirectly inculcates love of one's home and one's native land. To be "a fugitive and a vagabond" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12</a>) was a terrible punishment, as the Jews have learned by the experience of many centuries. Language and religion placed a barrier against residence in any country but their own (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84.htm">Psalm 84</a>.); and though at the time when this book was probably written they knew little of foreign travel, yet they regarded sojourn in a strange land as an evil, and centred all their ideas of happiness and comfort in a home life surrounded by friends and countrymen. The word "wander" may have the notion of going into exile. Septuagint, "As when a bird flies down from its own nest, so is a man brought into bondage when he is banished (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>) from his own place." Some have reasoned from this expression that the idea of exile had become familiar to the writer, and hence that this portion of the Proverbs is of very late origin (Cheyne) - surely a very uncertain foundation for such a conclusion. The love of Orientals for their native soil is a passion which no sordid and miserable surroundings can extinguish, and a man would consider even a change of home an unmixed evil, though such change was not the result of exile. Our view of the fortunes of one who is always shifting his abode is expressed in the adage, "A rolling stone gathers no moss." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>2 Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A stranger, and not thine own lips.<p>The negative &#1500;&#1488; is with &#1508;&#1497;&#1498;, as in (Arab.) ghyra fyk, bound into one compact idea: that which is not thine own mouth (Fleischer), "not thine own lips," on the other hand, is not to be interpreted as corresponding to it, like &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a>; since after the prohibitive &#1488;&#1500;, &#1497;&#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; [praise thee] easily supplies itself. &#1494;&#1512; is properly the stranger, as having come from a distance, and &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; he who comes from an unknown country, and is himself unknown (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-24.htm">Proverbs 26:24</a>); the idea of both words, however, passes from advena and alienigena to alius. There is certainly in rare cases a praising of oneself, which is authorized because it is demanded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-18.htm">2 Corinthians 11:18</a>), which, because it is offered strongly against one's will, will be measured by truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-13.htm">Proverbs 10:13</a>); but in general it is improper to applaud oneself, because it is a vain looking at oneself in a glass; it is indecent, because it places others in the shade; imprudent, because it is of no use to us, but only injures, for propria laus sordet, and as Stobus says, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Compare the German proverb, "Eigenlob stinkt, Freundes Lob hinkt, fremdes Lob klingt" [ equals  self-praise stinks, a friend's praise is lame, a stranger's praise sounds]. </body></html>
