This does not forbid preparing for to-morrow, but presuming upon to-morrow. We must not put off the great work of conversion, that one thing needful. 2. There may be occasion for us to justify ourselves, but not to praise ourselves. 3,4. Those who have no command of their passions, sink under the load. 5,6. Plain and faithful rebukes are better, not only than secret hatred, but than love which compliments in sin, to the hurt of the soul. 7. The poor have a better relish of their enjoyments, and are often more thankful for them, than the rich. In like manner the proud and self-sufficient disdain the gospel; but those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, find comfort from the meanest book or sermon that testifies of Christ Jesus. 8.

Men should do those things which are praiseworthy; and should do them openly, that they may be seen and praised for them: for it is honourable to have such a character as Demetrius had, who had a good report of all men; and as the brother had, whose praise in the Gospel was in all the churches. To be commended by others, by any but a man's self, is to his credit and reputation; but nothing more hurtful to it than self-commendation; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-18.htm">2 Corinthians 10:18</a>; in some cases it is right for a man indeed to commend himself, when the glory of God, the credit of religion, the cause of truth and self-vindication, require it; as the prophet Samuel, the Apostle Paul, and others, have been obliged to do, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>, &amp;c. <p>a stranger, and not thine own lips; a stranger means any other than a man's self; and if it is one that he knows not, or has little acquaintance with; or if a foreigner, that does not personally know him, only has good testimonies of him, or has read his works; and especially if in other respects an enemy; it is greatly to his honour to be praised by him: and such a commendation comes with much better grace than from himself, and from whom indeed it would not come with any. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth;</span> Septuagint, "Let thy neighbour (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) laud thee."

And a trite maxim runs, "In ore proprio laus sordet;" and an English one decides, "He who praises himself is a debtor to others."

(vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-17.htm">Genesis 47:17</a>) unites with this meaning also the meaning to make oneself known: to make oneself unknown, unrecognisable  equals  (Arab.) tanakkr, e.g., by means of clothing, or by a changed expression of countenance.<p>(Note: Vid., de Goeje's Fragmenta Hist. Arab. ii.((1871), p. 94. The verb &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, primarily to fix one's attention, sharply to contemplate anything, whence is derived the meanings of knowing and of not knowing, disowning. The account of the origin of these contrasted meanings, in Gesenius-Dietrich's Lexicon, is essentially correct; but the Arab. nakar there referred to means, not sharpness of mind, from nakar  equals  &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, but from the negative signification prevailing in the Arab. alone, a property by which one makes himself worthy of being disowned: craftiness, cunning, and then also in bonam partem: sagacity.)<p>The contrast demands here this latter signification: labiis suis alium se simulat osor, intus in pectore autem reconditum habet dolum (Fleischer). This rendering of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492; is more correct than Hitzig's ("in his breast) he prepares treachery;" for &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1492; is to be rendered after &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-3.htm">Psalm 13:3</a> (vid., Hupfeld's and also our comm. on this passage), not after <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-7.htm">Jeremiah 9:7</a>; for one says &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, to place snares, &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;, to lay an ambush, and the like, but not to place or to lay deceit.

The Arabic interpreters remark that a&#770;man with &#1489; expresses recognition, and with &#1500; submission (vid., Lane's Lexicon under a&#770;man); but in Hebr. &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; with &#1489; fiducia fidei, with &#1500; assensus fidei; the relation is thus not altogether the same.)<p>for seven abominations, i.e., a whole host of abominable thoughts and designs, are in his heart; he is, if one may express it, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-45.htm">Matthew 12:45</a>, possessed inwardly of seven devils.
