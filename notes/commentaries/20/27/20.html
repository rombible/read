The contentions of a neighbour may be like a sharp shower, troublesome for a time; the contentions of a wife are like constant rain. 17. We are cautioned to take heed whom we converse with. And directed to have in view, in conversation, to make one another wiser and better. 18. Though a calling be laborious and despised, yet those who keep to it, will find there is something to be got by it. God is a Master who has engaged to honour those who serve him faithfully. 19. One corrupt heart is like another; so are sanctified hearts: the former bear the same image of the earthly, the latter the same image of the heavenly. Let us carefully watch our own hearts, comparing them with the word of God. 20. Two things are here said to be never satisfied, death and sin. The appetites of the carnal mind for profit or pleasure are always desiring more. Those whose eyes are ever toward the Lord, are satisfied in him, and shall for ever be so. 21. Silver and gold are tried by putting them into the furnace and fining-pot; so is a man tried by praising him. 22. Some are so bad, that even severe methods do not answer the end; what remains but that they should be rejected? The new-creating power of God's grace alone is able to make a change. 23-27. We ought to have some business to do in this world, and not to live in idleness, and not to meddle with what we do not understand. We must be diligent and take pains. Let us do what we can, still the world cannot be secured to us, therefore we must choose a more lasting portion; but by the blessing of God upon our honest labours, we may expect to enjoy as much of earthly blessings as is good for us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hades, the world of the dead, and Destruction (Death, the destroying power, personified) have been at all times and in all countries thought of as all-devouring, insatiable (compare the marginal reference).

The grave, as the word used often signifies; and which may be called "destruction", because bodies laid in it are soon corrupted and destroyed; and though bodies are cast into it and devoured by it, it is ready for more; it is one of the four things which never have enough. The place where Gog is said to be buried is called Hamongog, the multitude of Gog, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a>; and by the Septuagint there Polyandrion, which is the name the Greeks give to a burying place, because many men are buried there; and with the Latins the dead are called Plures (o), the many, or the more; and yet the grave is never satisfied with them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-16.htm">Proverbs 30:16</a>. Or hell, the place of everlasting damnation and destruction, is meant, which has received multitudes of souls already, and where there is room for more, nor will it be full until the last day; <p>so the eyes of man are never satisfied; as not the eyes of his body with seeing corporeal objects, but still are desirous of seeing more, and indeed everything that is to be seen, and are never glutted, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>; so neither the eyes of the carnal mind, or the lusts of it, which are insatiable things, let the objects of them be what they will; as in an ambitious man, a covetous person, or an unclean one. <p>(o) Plauti Trinum, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>.

These "are never satisfied," they are insatiable, all-devouring (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-16.htm">Proverbs 30:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So the eyes of man are never satisfied.</span> The verb is the same in both clauses, and ought to have been so translated. The eye is taken as the representative of concupiscence in general. What is true of "the lust of the eyes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>) is true of all the senses; the craving for their gratification grows as it is fed. Therefore the senses should be carefully guarded, lest they lead to excess and transgression. "Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity," said the psalmist, "and quicken me in thy way" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-37.htm">Psalm 119:37</a>). The LXX. here introduces a paragraph not in the Hebrew or the Latin Versions: "He that fixes (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) his eye [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. staring impudently] is an abomination to the Lord, and the uninstructed restrain not their tongue." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This proverb, passing over the three immediately intervening, connects itself with <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-9.htm">Proverbs 27:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-10.htm">Proverbs 27:10</a>. It is directed against cringing, noisy complimenting:<p>He who blesseth his neighbour with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,<p>It is reckoned as a curse to him.<p>The first line is intentionally very heavy, in order to portray the empressement of the maker of compliments: he calls out to another his good wishes with a loud voice, so as to make the impression of deep veneration, of deeply felt thankfulness, but in reality to gain favour thereby, and to commend himself to greater acts of kindness; he sets himself to meet him, having risen up (&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, adverbial inf. abs.; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-4.htm">Jeremiah 44:4</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4</a>) early in the morning, to offer his captatio benevolentiae as speedily as possible; but this salutation of good wishes, the affected zeal in presenting which is a sign of a selfish, calculating, servile soul, is reckoned to him as &#1511;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492;, viz., before God and every one who can judge correctly of human nature, also before him who is complimented in so ostentatious and troublesome a manner, the true design of which is thus seen. Others understand the proverb after the example of Berachoth 14a, that one ought to salute no one till he has said his morning's prayer, because honour is due before all to God (the Book of Wisdom, 10:28); and others after Erachin 16a, according to which one is meant who was invited as a guest of a generous lord, and was liberally entertained, and who now on the public streets blesses him, i.e., praises him for his nobility of mind - such blessing is a curse to him whom it concerns, because this trumpeting of his praise brings upon him a troublesome, importunate crowd. But plainly the particularity of '&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; lays the chief emphasis on the servility manifested; and one calls to mind the case of the clients besieging the doors of their patrons, those clientes matutini, each of whom sought to be the first in the salutatio of his distinguished wealthy patron. </body></html>
