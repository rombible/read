Depend not for relief upon a kinsman, merely for kindred's sake; apply to those who are at hand, and will help in need. But there is a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother, and let us place entire confidence in him. 11. An affectionate parent urges his son to prudent conduct that should gladden his heart. The good conduct of Christians is the best answer to all who find fault with the gospel. 12. Where there is temptation, if we thrust ourselves into it, there will be sin, and punishment will follow. 13. An honest man may be made a beggar, but he is not honest that makes himself one. 14.

First, there are two proverbs, in each of which there is repeated a word terminating with &#1504;.<p>7 A satisfied soul treadeth honeycomb under foot;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And a hungry soul - everything bitter is (to it) sweet.<p>It is unnecessary to read &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; (Hitzig); &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505; is stronger; "to tread with the feet" is the extreme degree of scornful despite. That satiety and hunger are applicable to the soul, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-3.htm">Proverbs 10:3</a>. In 7b, the adverb &#1500;&#1492;&#1468;, relative to the nomin. absol., like <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-7.htm">Proverbs 28:7</a>, but not <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-18.htm">Proverbs 13:18</a>. "Hunger is the best cook," according to a German proverb; the Hebrew proverb is so formed that it is easily transferred to the sphere of the soul. Let the man whom God has richly satisfied with good things guard himself against ingratitude towards the Giver, and against an undervaluing of the gifts received; and if they are spiritual blessings, let him guard himself against self-satisfaction and self-contentment, which is, in truth, the worst poverty, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>; for life without God is a constant hunger and thirst. There is in worldly things, even the most pleasing, a dissatisfaction felt, and a dissatisfaction awakening disgust; and in spiritual life, a satiety which supposes itself to be full of life, but which is nothing else than the decay of life, than the changing of life into death. </body></html>
