Who have been long tried and proved, and found faithful; these should be kept to and valued, and not new ones sought; which to do is oftentimes of bad consequence. Solomon valued his father's friend Hiram, and kept up friendship with him; but Rehoboam his son forsook the counsel of the old men his father's friends and counsellors, and followed the young mien his new friends, and thereby lost ten tribes at once. Jarchi interprets this of God, the friend of Israel and of their fathers, who is not to be forsaken, and is a friend that loves at all times; and to forsake him is to forsake the fountain of living waters; <p>neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity; poverty and distress, to tell him thy case, expecting sympathy relief, and succour from him; but rather go to thy friend and father's friend, who sticks closer than a brother; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>; <p>for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off: a neighbour that is a fast and faithful friend, and who is not only near as to place but as to affections is more serviceable and, useful to a man in time of distress than a brother though near in blood, yet as far off in place, so much more in affection, and from whom a man can promise nothing, and little is to be expected. The phrase in the preceding clause signifies a cloudy day, and such a day of distress through poverty is; in which sense it is used by Latin (e) writers, when a man is alone, and former friends care not to come nigh him. <p>(e) "Tempora si fuerunt nubila, solus eris", Ovid.

The aim of this proverb is not of course to depreciate natural affection, but to warn against pressing unduly the claims of kinship and blood relationship, on which, with the sanction of the Law of Moses, such store was set in the East. Do not think it necessary, says the writer, to seek out in thy time of trouble a kinsman, who may be far from thee in place and sympathy, when thou hast one near at hand, who though he be no kinsman is the tried friend of thyself and of thy father before thee.

It seems to be a combination of two maxims. <span class="cmt_word">Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not.</span> A father's friend is one who is connected with a family by hereditary and ancestral bonds; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Septuagint. Such a one is to be cherished and regarded with the utmost affection. <span class="cmt_word">Neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity.</span> The tried friend is more likely to help and sympathize with you than even your own brother, for a friend is born for adversity, and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>, where see notes). The mere blood relationship, which is the result of circumstances over which one has had no control, is inferior to the affectionate connection which arises from moral considerations and is the effect of deliberate choice. We must remember, too, that the practice of polygamy, with the separate establishments of the various wives, greatly weakened the tie of brotherhood. There was little love between David's sons; and Jonathan was far dearer to David himself than any of his numerous brothers were. Better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off. "Near" and "far off" may be taken as referring to feeling or to local position. In the former case the maxim says that a neighbour who is really attached to one by the bonds of affection is better than the closest relation who has no love or sympathy. In the latter view, the proverb enunciates the truth that a friend on the spot in time of calamity is more useful than a brother living at a distance (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint); one is sure of help at once from the former, while application to the latter must occasion delay, and may not be successful.

Let one imagine the blind, relentless rage of extreme excitement and irritation, a boiling over of anger like a water-flood, which bears everything down along with it - these paroxysms of wrath do not usually continue long, and it is possible to appease them; but jealousy is a passion that not only rages, but reckons calmly; it incessantly ferments through the mind, and when it breaks forth, he perishes irretrievably who is its object. Fleischer generalizes this idea: "enmity proceeding from hatred, envy, or jealousy, it is difficult or altogether impossible to withstand, since it puts into operation all means, both secretly and openly, to injure the enemy." But after <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-34.htm">Proverbs 6:34</a>., cf. Sol 8:8, there is particularly meant the passion of scorned, mortified, deceived love, viz., in the relation of husband and wife. </body></html>
