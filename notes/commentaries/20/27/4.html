This does not forbid preparing for to-morrow, but presuming upon to-morrow. We must not put off the great work of conversion, that one thing needful. 2. There may be occasion for us to justify ourselves, but not to praise ourselves. 3,4. Those who have no command of their passions, sink under the load. 5,6. Plain and faithful rebukes are better, not only than secret hatred, but than love which compliments in sin, to the hurt of the soul. 7. The poor have a better relish of their enjoyments, and are often more thankful for them, than the rich. In like manner the proud and self-sufficient disdain the gospel; but those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, find comfort from the meanest book or sermon that testifies of Christ Jesus. 8.

Or "an inundation" (x); it is like the breaking in of the sea, or a flood of mighty waters, which know no bounds, and there is no stopping them: so cruel and outrageous were the wrath and anger of Simeon and Levi, in destroying the Shechemites; of Pharaoh, in making the Israelites to serve with hard bondage, and ordering their male children to be killed and drowned; and of Herod, in murdering the infants in and about Bethlehem; <p>but who is able to stand before envy? which is secret in a man's heart, and privately contrives and works the ruin of another, and against which there no guarding. All mankind in Adam fell before the envy of Satan; for it was through the envy of the devil that sin and death came into the world, in the Apocrypha: <p>"Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it.'' (Wisdom 2:24) <p>Abel could not stand before the envy of Cain; nor Joseph before the envy of his brethren; nor Christ before the envy of the Jews, his bitter enemies; and, where it is, there is confusion and every evil work, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14</a>. An envious man is worse than an angry and wrathful man; his wrath and anger may be soon over, or there may be ways and means of appeasing him; but envy continues and abides, and works insensibly. <p>(x) "inundatio", Michaelis, so Montanus, Vatablus, Tigurine version, "exundatio", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "inundatio salcans", Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wrath <i>is</i> cruel, and anger <i>is</i> outrageous; but who <i>is</i> able to stand before <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> envy?</span><p>(b) For the envious are obstinate, and cannot be reconciled.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">envy</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">jealousy</span>.

Figure to yourself the fierceness and cruelty of a sudden excitement of anger, or the bursting forth of passion which, like a flood, carries all before it; these may be violent for a time, yet they will subside when they have spent themselves. <span class="cmt_word">But who is able to stand before envy?</span> or rather, <span class="accented">jealousy</span>. The reference is not so much to the general feeling of envy as to the outraged love in the relation of husband and wife (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-34.htm">Proverbs 6:34</a>, and note there). <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6</a>, "Love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the flashes thereof are flashes of fire, a very vehement flame." Such jealousy does not blaze forth in some sudden outbreak, and then die away; it lives and broods and feeds itself hourly with fresh aliment, and is ready to act at any moment, hesitating at no means to gratify itself, and sacrificing without mercy its victim. Septuagint, "Pitiless is wrath, and sharp is anger; but jealousy (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) submits to nothing." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>26 Hatred may conceal itself behind deceit:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its wickedness shall be exposed in the assembly.<p>Proverbs which begin with the fut. are rarely to be found, it is true; yet, as we have seen, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-26.htm">Proverbs 12:26</a>, they are sometimes to be met with in the collection. This is one of the few that are of such a character; for that the lxx and others translate &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, which gives for &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1493; a more appropriate reference, does not require us to agree with Hitzig in reading &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1492; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-16.htm">Proverbs 12:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-23.htm">Proverbs 12:23</a>) - the two clauses rendered fut. stand in the same syntactical relation, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-24.htm">Job 20:24</a>. Still less can the rendering of &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; by &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, by the lxx, induce us to read with Hitzig &#1495;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, especially since it is doubtful whether the Heb. words which floated before those translators (the lxx) have been fallen upon. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (beginning and ending with a formative syllable) is certainly a word of rare formation, to be compared only to &#1502;&#1505;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-23.htm">Judges 3:23</a>; but since the nearest-lying formation &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488; signifies usury (from &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, to credit) (according to which Symmachus, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;, to desire gain), it is obvious that the language preferred this double formation for the meaning deceiving, illusion, or, exactly: fraud. It may also be possible to refer it, like &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; (vid., under <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-6</a> :18), to &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, to be confused, waste, as this is done by Parchon, Kimchi (Venet. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;), Ralbag, and others; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, in this sense of deepest concealment, certainly says not a little as the contrast of &#1511;&#1492;&#1500; [an assembly], but &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1501; [a desert] stood ready for the poet to be used in this sense; he might also have expressed himself as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-3.htm">Job 30:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-27.htm">Job 38:27</a>. The selection of this rare word is better explained if it denotes the superlative of deceit - a course of conduct maliciously directed toward the deception of a neighbour. That is also the impression which the word has made on Jerome (fraudulenter), the Targ. (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505;&#1514;&#1488;, in grinding), Luther (to do injury), and according to which it has already been explained, e.g., by C. B. Michaelis and Oetinger ("with dissembled, deceitful nature"). The punctuation of &#1514;&#1499;&#1505;&#1492;, Codd. and editions present in three different forms. Buxtorf in his Concordance (also Frst), and the Basel Biblia Rabbinica, have the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;; but this is a mistake. Either &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1492; (Niph.) &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; (Hithpa., with the same assimilation of the preformative &#1514; as in &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1505;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-55.htm">Leviticus 13:55</a>; &#1504;&#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-8.htm">Deuteronomy 21:8</a>) is to be read; Kimchi, in his Wrterbuch, gives &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;, which is certainly better supported. A surer contrast of &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1489;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500; remains in our interpretation; only we translate not as Ewald: "hatred seeks to conceal itself by hypocrisy," but: in deceitful work. Also we refer &#1512;&#1506;&#1514;&#1493;, not to &#1489;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, but to &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492;, for hatred is thought of in connection with its personal representative. We see from 26b that hatred is meant which not only broods over evil, but also carries it into execution. Such hatred may conceal itself in cunningly-contrived deception, yet the wickedness of the hater in the end comes out from behind the mask with the light of publicity. </body></html>
