The contentions of a neighbour may be like a sharp shower, troublesome for a time; the contentions of a wife are like constant rain. 17. We are cautioned to take heed whom we converse with. And directed to have in view, in conversation, to make one another wiser and better. 18. Though a calling be laborious and despised, yet those who keep to it, will find there is something to be got by it. God is a Master who has engaged to honour those who serve him faithfully. 19. One corrupt heart is like another; so are sanctified hearts: the former bear the same image of the earthly, the latter the same image of the heavenly. Let us carefully watch our own hearts, comparing them with the word of God. 20. Two things are here said to be never satisfied, death and sin. The appetites of the carnal mind for profit or pleasure are always desiring more. Those whose eyes are ever toward the Lord, are satisfied in him, and shall for ever be so. 21. Silver and gold are tried by putting them into the furnace and fining-pot; so is a man tried by praising him. 22. Some are so bad, that even severe methods do not answer the end; what remains but that they should be rejected? The new-creating power of God's grace alone is able to make a change. 23-27. We ought to have some business to do in this world, and not to live in idleness, and not to meddle with what we do not understand. We must be diligent and take pains. Let us do what we can, still the world cannot be secured to us, therefore we must choose a more lasting portion; but by the blessing of God upon our honest labours, we may expect to enjoy as much of earthly blessings as is good for us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Appeareth - Better, When the grass disappeareth, the "tender grass showeth itself." Stress is laid on the regular succession of the products of the earth. The "grass" ("hay") of the first clause is (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-26.htm">2 Kings 19:26</a>) the proverbial type of what is perishable and fleeting. The verse gives a picture of the pleasantness of the farmer's calling; compared with this what can wealth or rank offer? With this there mingles (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a>) the thought that each stage of that life in its season requires care and watchfulness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25-27. The fact that providential arrangements furnish the means of competence to those who properly use them is another motive to diligence (compare Ps 65:9-13).<p>The hay appeareth&#8212;literally, "Grass appeareth" (Job 40:15; Ps 104:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The hay appeareth, and the tender grass showeth itself, </span> in their proper seasons. These things may be here mentioned, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. As the matter of his diligence. Take care that thy hay and grass may be well managed, and seasonably gathered, for the use of thy cattle. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. As another argument and encouragement to diligence, because God invites thee to it by the plentiful provisions wherewith he hath enriched the earth for thy sake. Thou needest not compass sea and land for them, for God puts them into thy hand, if thou wilt but receive them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Herbs of the mountains, </span> even the most barren parts afford thee their help, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">are gathered; </span> or, <span class="ital">are to be gathered</span>, as such passive verbs are oft used; they are ripe and ready for the gathering. So this clause suits best with the former. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The hay appeareth, and the tender grass showeth itself,.... Some think this is mentioned to illustrate the uncertainty of riches, which soon vanish away; as the tender grass shows itself, and is presently cut down and quickly appears hay, and that soon consumed; but rather this contains an argument to take to the pastoral life and calling, since it may be performed with so much ease; for the earth, the valleys and hills, are covered with grass for the cattle; so that there is no further trouble than to drive the flocks into the pastures, and feed them there; or to cut down the grass, and make hay of it, and lay it up against the winter for fodder for them. The first clause, I think, may be rendered, "the hay removes" (u), or is carried off; the grass being fit to cut, is mowed and made hay of, and that is carried off and laid up for the winter: "and the tender grass showeth itself"; springs up after the hay is carried off and so makes a second crop; or, however, becomes good pasture for cattle to feed on; <p>and herbs of the mountains are gathered; for the present use of the cattle; or being made hay of, are laid up for future use; or are gathered for medicine; many of this kind grow on mountains. <p>(u) "migrat", Cocceius; "cum migraverit", Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">hay</span>] “Heb. <span class="ital">grass</span>,” R.V. marg.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">appeareth</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">is carried</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the mountains</span>] Com p. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-8.htm" title="Who covers the heaven with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow on the mountains.">Psalm 147:8</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - As ver. 23 commended the rearing of cattle, and ver. 24 supported the injunction by showing its comparative permanence, so this and the following verses discuss the material advantages of such occupation. <span class="cmt_word">The hay appeareth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the grass passeth away</span>, is cut and carried.

All these verbs are best taken hypothetically, the following verses forming the apodosis. When all these operations are complete, then crone the results in plenty and comfort. Septuagint, "Have a care of the herbage (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) in the plain, and thou shalt cut grass, and gather thou the mountain hay." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>19 As it is with water, face correspondeth to face,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So also the heart of man to man.<p>Thus the traditional text is to be translated; for on the supposition that &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; must be used for &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, yet it might not be translated: as in waters face corresponds to face (Jerome: quomodo in aquis resplendent vultus respicientium), because &#1499;&#1468; (instar) is always only a prep. and never conj. subordinating to itself a whole sentence (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-14.htm">Psalm 38:14</a>). But whether &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, "like water," may be an abridgment of a sentence: "like as it is with water," is a question, and the translation of the lxx (Syr., Targ., Arab.), &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c7; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;., appears, according to Bttcher's ingenious conjecture, to have supposed &#1499;&#1488;&#1513;&#1512; &#1489;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, from which the lxx derived &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, sicut non pares. The thought is beautiful: as in the water-mirror each one beholds his own face (Luther: der Scheme  equals  the shadow), so out of the heart of another each sees his own heart, i.e., he finds in another the dispositions and feelings of his own heart (Fleischer) - the face finds in water its reflection, and the heart of a man finds in man its echo; men are &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, and it is a fortunate thing that their heart is capable of the same sympathetic feelings, so that one can pour into the heart of another that which fills and moves his own heart, and can there find agreement with it, and a re-echo. The expression with &#1500; is extensive: one corresponds to another, one belongs to another, is adapted to the other, turns to the other, so that the thought may be rendered in manifold ways: the divinely-ordained mutual relationship is always the ground-thought. This is wholly obliterated by Hitzig's conjecture &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, "what a mole on the face is to the face, that is man's heart to man," i.e., the heart is the dark spot in man, his partie honteuse. But the Scripture nowhere speaks of the human heart after this manner, at least the Book of Proverbs, in which &#1500;&#1489; frequently means directly the understanding. Far more intelligible and consistent is the conjecture of Mendel Stern, to which Abrahamsohn drew my attention: &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, like water (viz., flowing water), which directs its course always forward, thus (is turned) the heart of man to man. This conjecture removes the syntactic harshness of the first member without changing the letters, and illustrates by a beautiful and excellent figure the natural impulse moving man to man. It appears, however, to us, in view of the lxx, more probable that &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is abbreviated from the original &#1499;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-29.htm">Proverbs 24:29</a>). </body></html>
