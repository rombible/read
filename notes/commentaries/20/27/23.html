The contentions of a neighbour may be like a sharp shower, troublesome for a time; the contentions of a wife are like constant rain. 17. We are cautioned to take heed whom we converse with. And directed to have in view, in conversation, to make one another wiser and better. 18. Though a calling be laborious and despised, yet those who keep to it, will find there is something to be got by it. God is a Master who has engaged to honour those who serve him faithfully. 19. One corrupt heart is like another; so are sanctified hearts: the former bear the same image of the earthly, the latter the same image of the heavenly. Let us carefully watch our own hearts, comparing them with the word of God. 20. Two things are here said to be never satisfied, death and sin. The appetites of the carnal mind for profit or pleasure are always desiring more. Those whose eyes are ever toward the Lord, are satisfied in him, and shall for ever be so. 21. Silver and gold are tried by putting them into the furnace and fining-pot; so is a man tried by praising him. 22. Some are so bad, that even severe methods do not answer the end; what remains but that they should be rejected? The new-creating power of God's grace alone is able to make a change. 23-27. We ought to have some business to do in this world, and not to live in idleness, and not to meddle with what we do not understand. We must be diligent and take pains. Let us do what we can, still the world cannot be secured to us, therefore we must choose a more lasting portion; but by the blessing of God upon our honest labours, we may expect to enjoy as much of earthly blessings as is good for us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The verses sing the praises of the earlier patriarchal life, with its flocks and herds, and tillage of the ground, as compared with the commerce of a later time, with money as its chief or only wealth.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a><p>The state - literally, face.

In what condition they are; what health they enjoy; how fat and fruitful they be; what pasturage they have; and that they want nothing fitting for them that can be had and is necessary; and also the number of them. The calling of the shepherd is here particularly mentioned, because valiant, honourable, innocent, and useful; but the same diligence is to be used in all other callings and business men are employed in, that they may provide for themselves and their families. It is in the original text, "the face of thy flocks" (r); perhaps the allusion is to the exact and distinct knowledge some very diligent careful shepherds might have, so as to know each sheep in their flocks distinctly; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3</a>; The Septuagint version renders it, the souls of thy flock, as if it was an instruction to spiritual pastors or shepherds, who have the care of the souls of men: and certain it is, that if it is the duty of shepherds in common to be diligent in looking after their sheep, and doing everything the duty of their office requires; then it must become the indispensable duty of pastors of churches to take heed to the flock of God committed to them, and to look into their state and condition, and provide for them, and feed them with knowledge and understanding, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; <p>and look well to thy herds; or, "put thy heart" (s) to them: show a cordial regard for them, and take a hearty care of them, that they have everything needful for them; and which is for the owner's good as well as theirs. <p>(r)  "faciem pecoris tui", Tigurine version, Mercerus, Cocceius, Michaelis, Schultens; "vultum", V.

Accordingly he translates: "iron together with iron! and one together with the face of another!" But then the prep. &#1489; or &#1506;&#1501; is wanting after the second &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; - for &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; is, in spite of Ewald, 217h, never a prep. - and the "face," 17b, would be a perplexing superfluity. Hitzig already replies, but without doing homage to the traditional text-punctuation, that such a violence to the use of language, and such a darkening of the thought, is not at all to be accepted. He suggests four ways of interpreting &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;: (1) the adverb &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;, united, properly (taken accusat.) union; (2) &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/86-11.htm">Psalm 86:11</a>, imper. of the Piel &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;, unite; (3) &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-6.htm">Job 3:6</a>, jussive of the Kal &#1495;&#1491;&#1492;, gaudeat; and (4) as Kimchi, in Michlol 126a, jussive of the Kal &#1495;&#1491;&#1492; ( equals  &#1495;&#1491;&#1491;) acuere, after the form &#1514;&#1495;&#1494;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1509;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-8.htm">Genesis 32:8</a>, etc. in p. &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;, after the form &#1488;&#1495;&#1494;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/23-9.htm">Job 23:9</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a> ( equals  &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>). If we take &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;, then it is  priori to be supposed that in &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; the idea of sharpening lies; in the Arab. iron is simply called hadyda  equals  &#1495;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, that which is sharpened, sharp; and a current Arab. proverb says: alh&#803;adyd balh&#803;adyd yuflah  equals  ferrum ferro diffinditur (vid., Freytag under the word falah). But is the traditional text-punctuation thus understood to be rightly maintained? It may be easily changed in conformity with the meaning, but not so that with Bttcher we read &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; and &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;, the fut. Kal of &#1495;&#1491;&#1491;: "iron sharpeneth itself on iron, and a man sharpeneth himself over against his neighbour" - for &#1508;&#1504;&#1497; after a verb to be understood actively, has to be regarded as the object - but since &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; is changed into &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; (fut. Hiph. of &#1495;&#1491;&#1491;), and &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; into &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; or &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; (fut. Hiph. of &#1495;&#1491;&#1491;, after the form &#1488;&#1495;&#1500;, incipiam, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>, or &#1488;&#1495;&#1500;, profanabo, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-3.htm">Numbers 30:3</a>). The passive rendering of the idea 17a and the active of 17b thus more distinctly appear, and the unsuitable jussive forms are set aside: ferrum ferro exacuitur, et homo exacuit faciem amici sui (Jerome, Targ., the Venet.). But that is not necessary. As &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; may be the fut. of the Hiph. (he brought up) as well as of the Kal (he went up), so &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; may be regarded as fut. Kal, and &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; as fut. Hiph. Fleischer prefers to render &#1497;&#1495;&#1491; also as Hiph.: aciem exhibet, like &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, divitias acquirit, and the like; but the jussive is not favourable to this supposition of an intransitive (inwardly transitive) Hiph. It may indeed be said that the two jussives appear to be used, according to poetic licence, with the force of indicatives (cf. under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-26.htm">Proverbs 12:26</a>), but the repetition opposes it. Thus we explain: iron is sharpened [gewetzt, Luther uses this appropriate word] by iron (&#1489; of the means, not of the object, which was rather to be expected in 17b after <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-30.htm">Proverbs 20:30</a>), and a man whets &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, the appearance, the deportment, the nature, and manner of the conduct of his neighbour. The proverb requires that the intercourse of man with man operate in the way of sharpening the manner and forming the habits and character; that one help another to culture and polish of manner, rub off his ruggedness, round his corners, as one has to make use of iron when he sharpens iron and seeks to make it bright. The jussive form is the oratorical form of the expression of that which is done, but also of that which is to be done. </body></html>
