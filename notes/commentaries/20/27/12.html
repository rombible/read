Depend not for relief upon a kinsman, merely for kindred's sake; apply to those who are at hand, and will help in need. But there is a Friend that sticketh closer than a brother, and let us place entire confidence in him. 11. An affectionate parent urges his son to prudent conduct that should gladden his heart. The good conduct of Christians is the best answer to all who find fault with the gospel. 12. Where there is temptation, if we thrust ourselves into it, there will be sin, and punishment will follow. 13. An honest man may be made a beggar, but he is not honest that makes himself one. 14.

See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>; or "seeth the evil" (f); the evil of sin, as it is contrary to the nature, will, and law and abominable in his sight; and not only the evil of gross actions of sin, but of indwelling lust; and such an one, who is wise to that which is good, sees the sad work sin has made in the world, and in himself; how it has defaced the image of God in man, stripped him of his righteousness, and defiled all the powers and faculties of his soul; upon which sight of it he is filled with shame, reflects upon himself for his past conduct, loathes sin, and himself for it, repents of it, confesses and forsakes it: he likewise sees the evil of punishment for sin, the just demerit of it, the curse of the law, the wrath of God, the second and eternal death, a separation from God, a sense and feeling of divine vengeance, anguish, and distress intolerable, and that for ever; <p>and hideth himself; not in secret places, that he may not be seen by the Lord; nor in his own works of righteousness, to secure him from the wrath of God: nor is it to he understood of his hiding himself from sinners and their company, and so escaping the pollutions of the world; but of his betaking himself to Christ, who is the city of refuge, the stronghold, the rock, in the clefts of which the people of God hide themselves; even in his wounds, or in him as a suffering crucified Saviour, and who is the hiding place from the wind, and covert from the storm of divine wrath; such are redemption by him, his sacrifice and satisfaction, his blood and righteousness, and intercession; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; also See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>; <p>but the simple pass on, and are punished; such who are thoughtless and foolish, have no sight nor sense of sin and danger, go on in their sinful course of life without any care or concern, without any fear or dread, till their feet stumble on the dark mountains of eternity; and they fall into the bottomless pit of perdition, from whence there is no recovery. <p>(f) "videns", V.

The three meanings are the following: (a) to smoke, Aram. &#1506;&#1496;&#1512;, whence &#1506;&#1514;&#1512;, vapour, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a>, according to which the Venet., with Kimchi's and Parchon's Lex., translates: the kisses of an enemy &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, i.e., are fog; (b) to sacrifice, to worship, Arab. atar; according to which Aquila: &#x3b9;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769; (as, with Grabe, it is probably to be read for &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; of the lxx); and agreeably to the Niph., but too artificially, Arama: obtained by entreaties  equals  constrained; (c) to heap up, whence Hiph. &#1492;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-13.htm">Ezekiel 35:13</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-6.htm">Jeremiah 33:6</a>, according to which Rashi, Meri, Gesenius, Fleischer, Bertheau, and most explain, cogn. with &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, whose Aram. form is &#1506;&#1514;&#1512;, for &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is properly a heap of goods or treasures.<p>(Note: Vid., regarding this word, Schlottmann in Deutsch.-Morgenl. Zeitschrift, xxiv. 665, 668.)<p>This third meaning gives to the kisses of an enemy a natural adjective: they are too abundant, so much the more plentiful to veil over the hatred, like the kisses by means of which Judas betrayed his Lord, not merely denoted by &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, but by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-49.htm">Matthew 26:49</a>. This, then, is the contrast, that the strokes inflicted by one who truly loves us, although they tear into our flesh (&#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;, to split, to tear open), yet are faithful (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-5.htm">Psalm 141:5</a>); on the contrary, the enemy covers over with kisses him to whom he wishes all evil. Thus also &#1504;&#1506;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; forms an indirect contrast to &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. </body></html>
