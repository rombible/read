The sense of the verse is, This fear of God, or true religion, is not only necessary to the salvation of the soul, but is also calculated to promote the health of the body. For, as it prevents those diseases which are often occasioned by sinful lusts and passion, so it teaches that prudence, temperance, and sobriety, that calmness and composure of mind, that good government of the appetites and passions, which must, in the nature of things, tend to produce a good habit of body; and at the same time it gives us an interest in God’s promises, and places us under the care of his special providence.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 There is not a greater enemy to the fear of the Lord in the heart, than self-conceit of our own wisdom. The prudence and sobriety which religion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they promote their holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The great hindrance to all true wisdom is the thought that we have already attained it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

So as to act independently of God; not to trust in him, nor acknowledge him, nor seek to him for help and direction; nor ask nor take the advice of others; but, being conceited and self-sufficient, lean to thine own understanding, as being wise enough to conduct all affairs in life by thy own discretion; and in matters of religion wiser than thy teachers, and even than the Scriptures, being wise above that which is written; pleasing thyself with thine own wisdom, as exceeding others; glorying in it as thine own acquisition, and not ascribing it to God, so far as it any ways deserves the name of wisdom; though for the most part that which men glory in, and are conceited of, is not wisdom, but folly; and at least it is their folly to boast of it and be elated with it; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>; <p>fear the Lord; which is true wisdom; and, where this is not, there is none, let men be ever so conceited; and where this is there is humility; these two go together, and make a man wise, rich, and honourable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-4.htm">Proverbs 22:4</a>. The fear of the Lord is opposed to pride, high-mindedness, and vain conceit, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20</a>; this includes reverence of God, faith in him, dependence on him, acknowledgment of him, seeking to him for direction, and carefulness not to offend him; <p>and depart from evil; from the evil of self-confidence and self-conceit, and from all other evil; the fear of God influences men to avoid sin, and abstain from all appearance of it; by means and through the exercise of it men forsake it, and keep at a distance from it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>. Nehemiah could not do as others did, because of the fear of the Lord; and Job was a man that feared God, and therefore he avoided that which was evil, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-15.htm">Nehemiah 5:15</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. The first clause of this verse in the rendering of the LXX., <span class="greekheb">φρόνιμος παρὰ σεαυτῷ</span>, is quoted by St Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm" title="Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.">Romans 12:16</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not wise in thine own eyes.</span> This admonition carries on the thought from the preceding verses (5, 6), approaching it from a different direction. It is a protest against self-sufficiency, self-conceit, and self-reliance. It says, in effect, "Trust in the Lord, do not trust in yourself." Wisdom, as Michaelis remarks, is to trust in God; to trust in yourself and in your own wisdom is unwisdom. God denounces this spirit: "Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-21.htm">Isaiah 5:21</a>), because such a spirit leads to the prohibited self-dependence, and is inconsistent with "the tear of the Lord." The precept of the text is reiterated by St. Paul, especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>, "Be not wise in your own conceits" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-3.htm">Galatians 6:3</a>). It commends humility. The diligent search for Wisdom is commanded. The great hindrance to all true wisdom is the thought that we have already attained it (Plumptre). <span class="accented">In thine own eyes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in thine own estimation; <span class="accented">arbitrio tuo</span> (Trem. et Jun.). <span class="cmt_word">Fear the Lord, and depart from evil.</span> The connection of this with the first part of the verse becomes clear upon reflection. "The fear of the Lord" is true wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Fear the Lord, therefore, because it is the best corrective of one's own wisdom, which engenders arrogance, pride, presumption of mind, which, moreover, is deceptive and apt to lead to sin. The fear of the Lord has this other advantage - that it leads to the departure from evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>) It is the mark of the wise man that he fears the Lord, and departs from evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>). These precepts form the two elements of practical piety (Delitzsch), an eminent example of which as Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; there commences a new section, coordinating itself with the &#1500;&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; ("to deliver thee") of <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-12.htm">Proverbs 2:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>, unfolding that which wisdom accomplishes as a preserver and guide:<p>20 So that thou walkest in the good way,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keepest the right paths.<p>21 For the upright shall inhabit the land,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the innocent shall remain in it.<p>22 But the godless are cut off out the land,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the faithless are rooted out of it.<p>Wisdom - thus the connection - will keep thee, so that thou shalt not fall under the seductions of man or of woman; keep, in order that thou... &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; (from &#1502;&#1506;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, tendency, purpose) refers to the intention and object of the protecting wisdom. To the two negative designations of design there follows, as the third and last, a positive one. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (contrast to &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-19.htm">Proverbs 14:19</a>) is here used in a general ethical sense: the good (Guten, not Gtigen, the kind). &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, with the object of the way, may in another connection also mean to keep oneself from, cavere ab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-4.htm">Psalm 17:4</a>); here it means: carefully to keep in it. The promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-21.htm">Proverbs 2:21</a> is the same as in the Mashal <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-11.htm">Psalm 37:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-22.htm">Psalm 37:22</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-30.htm">Proverbs 10:30</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is Canaan, or the land which God promised to the patriarchs, and in which He planted Israel, whom He had brought out of Egypt; not the earth, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, according to the extended, unlimited N.T. circle of vision. &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (Milel) is erroneously explained by Schultens: funiculis bene firmis irroborabunt in terra.

Niph. &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-25.htm">Proverbs 15:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>, active: evellant; and this, with the subj. remaining indefinite (for which J.

This indefinite "they" or "one" ("man"), Fleischer remarks, can even be used of God, as here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a> - a thing which is common in Persian, where e.g., the expression rendered hominem ex pulvere fecerunt is used instead of the fuller form, which would be rendered homo a Deo ex pulvere factus est. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; bears (as &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491; proves) the primary meaning of concealed, i.e., malicious (treacherous and rapacious, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>), and then faithless men.<p>(Note: Similar is the relation in Arab. of labbasa to liba&#770;s (&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;); it means to make a thing unknown by covering it; whence telb&#305;&#770;s, deceit, mulebbis, a falsifier.) </body></html>
