We must make wisdom our business; we must venture all in it, and be willing to part with all for it. This Wisdom is the Lord Jesus Christ and his salvation, sought and obtained by faith and prayer. Were it not for unbelief, remaining sinfulness, and carelessness, we should find all our ways pleasantness, and our paths peace, for his are so; but we too often step aside from them, to our own hurt and grief. Christ is that Wisdom, by whom the worlds were made, and still are in being; happy are those to whom he is made of God wisdom. He has wherewithal to make good all his promises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-7.htm">Genesis 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38.htm">Job 38</a>. Looking upon the face of Nature, men see two storehouses of the living water, without which it would be waste and barren.

Some refer this to the breaking up the fountains of the great deep at the flood, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; and others to the dividing of the waters of the Red sea when Israel came out of Egypt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-13.htm">Psalm 78:13</a>; all wonderful works of divine wisdom, and show the greatness of him, in whom are "hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge", <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>, by whom they were done; <p>and the clouds drop down the dew; which makes the earth fruitful, and is put for all the blessings of nature, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28</a>; the drops of dew are begotten by the Lord, they have no other father but him; the vanities of the Gentiles cannot produce them; he who fills the clouds with them, from whence they descend, is no other than the mighty God; and such is Christ the Wisdom of God. Some understand this in a mystical sense of Gospel ministers, and of the dew of Gospel doctrine, dropped and distilled by them under the influence and direction of Christ; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>; but the literal sense is best. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">are</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">were</span> <span class="ital">broken up</span>, R.V.

So Munster, Zockler, Wardlaw. But it seems better to understand it (as Mercerus, Lapide, Delitzsch, and Authorized Version) of the fertilization of the earth by rivers, streams, etc., which burst forth from the interior of the earth. In this sense the correspondence is preserved with the second hemistich. where the atmospheric influence is referred to as conducing to the same end. The teacher passes from the creation to the wonderful means which Jehovah employs through Wisdom to sustain his work. <span class="accented">The depths</span> (<span class="accented">t'homoth</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">abyssi</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, are here "the internal water stores of the earth" (Delitzsch), and not the depths of the ocean, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-24.htm">Proverbs 8:24, 27, 28</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. <span class="accented">Are broken up</span> (<span class="accented">niv'kau</span>); properly, <span class="accented">were broken up</span>, niph. perfect of <span class="accented">baka</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to cleave asunder, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to break forth, as water, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The perfect describes a past act, but one that is still continuing in effect. Cf.

There seems to be no allusion here either to the Deluge (Beds), nor to the cleaving of the waters of the Red Sea (Gejerus), though both of these historical events were undoubtedly well known to the teacher. And the clouds drop down the dew. <span class="accented">The clouds</span> (<span class="accented">sh'khakim</span>) are properly the <span class="accented">ether</span>, the higher and colder regions of the atmosphere, and then "the clouds," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-15.htm">Psalm 77:15</a>, which are formed by the condensation of vapours drawn by solar influence from the surface of the earth - seas, rivers, etc. The singular <span class="accented">shakhak</span> signifies "dust," and. secondly "a cloud," evidently from the minute particles of moisture of which a cloud is composed. <span class="accented">Drop down</span> (<span class="accented">yir'aphu</span>, kal future of <span class="accented">raaph</span>, used as a present or imperfect); LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "let flow." The clouds discharge their contents in showers, or distil at evening in refreshing dew. Modern science agrees with the meteorological fact here alluded to, of the reciprocal action of the heavens and the earth. The moisture drawn from the earth returns again "to water the earth, that it may bring forth and bud, to give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>). <span class="accented">Dew</span>; <span class="accented">tal</span>, here used not only of dew, but of rain in gentle and fructifying showers. The Arabic word signifies "light rain;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "dew." Moses, in describing the blessing of Israel, says, "His heavens shall drop down dew" in the same sense (Deuteronomy 38:28; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-28.htm">Job 36:28</a>). The fertilization of the earth is ordered by the Divine Wisdom.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Such submission to God, the All-wise, the All-directing, who loves us with fatherly affection, is wisdom, and such wisdom is above all treasures.<p>13 Blessed is the man who has found wisdom,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the man who has gained understanding;<p>14 For better is her acquisition than the acquisition of silver,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her gain than fine gold.<p>15 More precious is she than corals;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all thy jewels do not equal her value.<p>The imperfect &#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;, which as the Hiph. of &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, exire, has the general meaning educere, interchanges with the perfect &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;. This bringing forth is either a delivering up, i.e., giving out or presenting, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-10.htm">Isaiah 58:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-9.htm">Psalm 140:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/144-13.htm">Psalm 144:13</a> (cf. &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;, Arab. nafak&#803;, to give out, to pay out), or a fetching out, getting out, receiving, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-2.htm">Proverbs 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>. Thus 13a reminds one of the parable of the treasure in the field, and 13b of that of the goodly pearl for which the &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; who sought the pearl parted with all that he had. Here also is declared the promise of him who trades with a merchant for the possession of wisdom; for &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;&#1468; and &#1505;&#1495;&#1512; (both, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-18.htm">Isaiah 23:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-15.htm">Isaiah 45:15</a>, from &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;, the latter after the forms &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, &#1504;&#1496;&#1506;, without our needing to assume a second primary form, &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;) go back to the root-word &#1505;&#1495;&#1512;, to trade, go about as a trader, with the fundamental meaning &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (lxx); and also the mention of the pearls is not wanting here, for at all events the meaning "pearls" has blended itself with &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which is a favourite word in the Mashal poetry, though it be not the original meaning of the word. In 14b &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1507; is surpassed by &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (besides in the Proverbs, found only in this meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>), which properly means ore found in a mine, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1509;, to cut in, to dig up, and hence the poetic name of gold, perhaps of gold dug out as distinguished from molten gold. Hitzig regards &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; as identical with it; but this word (Sanskr. without the ending hir, Zench. zar) is derived from ghar, to glitter (vid., Curtius). &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; we have translated "gain," for it does not mean the profit which wisdom brings, the tribute which it yields, but the gain, the possession of wisdom herself.</body></html>
