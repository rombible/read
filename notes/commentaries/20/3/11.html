A wonderful advance beyond the teaching of the Pentateuch: <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Deuteronomy 28, in which the Jews had to be treated as children, and punishment or reward follow as the immediate consequence of bad or good behaviour. Under such a discipline misfortune could only be regarded as a punishment, a sign of God’s displeasure; but now a further manifestation of His dealings with man is made. When He sends trouble upon His children, He is no longer to be regarded as an offended father punishing their faults, but as one who in love is correcting them. Even the New Testament quotes these words with approval, and without adding anything to their teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-5.htm" title="And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as to children, My son, despise not you the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of him:">Hebrews 12:5-13</a>). There it is shown how all God’s children must, without exception, submit to this discipline.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/proverbs/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Proverbs<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE GIFTS OF HEAVENLY WISDOM<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm" title="My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:">Proverbs 3:11</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-24.htm" title="When you lie down, you shall not be afraid: yes, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.">Proverbs 3:24</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The repetition of the words ‘my son’ at the beginning of this passage marks a new section, which extends to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-20.htm" title="By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.">Proverbs 3:20</a>, inclusively, another section being similarly marked as commencing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-21.htm" title="My son, let not them depart from your eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:">Proverbs 3:21</a>. The fatherly counsels of these early chapters are largely reiterations of the same ideas, being line upon line. ‘To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.’ Many strokes drive the nail home. Exhortations to get Wisdom, based upon the blessings she brings, are the staple of the whole. If we look carefully at the section {<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm" title="My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:">Proverbs 3:11</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-20.htm" title="By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.">Proverbs 3:20</a>}, we find in it a central core {<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-13.htm" title="Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.">Proverbs 3:13</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm" title="She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and happy is every one that retains her.">Proverbs 3:18</a>}, setting forth the blessings which Wisdom gives, preceded by two verses, inculcating the right acceptance of God’s chastisements which are one chief means of attaining Wisdom, and followed by two verses {<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-19.htm" title="The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has he established the heavens.">Proverbs 3:19</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-20.htm" title="By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.">Proverbs 3:20</a>}, which exalt her as being divine as well as human. So the portraiture of her working in humanity is framed by a prologue and epilogue, setting forth two aspects of her relation to God; namely, that she is imparted by Him through the discipline of trouble, and that she dwells in His bosom and is the agent of His creative work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The prologue, then, points to sorrow and trouble, rightly accepted, as one chief means by which we acquire heavenly Wisdom. Note the profound insight into the meaning of sorrows. They are ‘instruction’ and ‘reproof.’ The thought of the Book of Job is here fully incorporated and assimilated. Griefs and pains are not tokens of anger, nor punishments of sin, but love-gifts meant to help to the acquisition of wisdom. They do not come because the sufferers are wicked, but in order to make them good or better. Tempests are meant to blow us into port. The lights are lowered in the theatre that fairer scenes may become visible on the thin screen between us and eternity. Other supports are struck away that we may lean hard on God. The voice of all experience of earthly loss and bitterness is, ‘Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get Wisdom.’ God himself becomes our Schoolmaster, and through the voice of the human teacher we hear His deeper tones saying, ‘My son, despise not the chastening.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note, too, the assurance that all discipline is the fruit of Fatherly love. How many sad hearts in all ages these few words have calmed and braced! How sharp a test of our childlike spirit our acceptance of them, when our own hearts are sore, is! How deep the peace which they bring when really believed! How far they go to solve the mystery of pain, and turn darkness into a solemn light!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note, further, that the words ‘despise’ and ‘be weary’ both imply rather rejection with loathing, and thus express unsubmissive impatience which gets no good from discipline. The beautiful rendering of the Septuagint, which has been made familiar by its adoption in Hebrews, makes the two words express two opposite faults. They ‘despise’ who steel their wills against the rod, and make as if they did not feel the pain; they ‘faint’ who collapse beneath the blows, which they feel so much that they lose sight of their purpose. Dogged insensibility and utter prostration are equally harmful. He who meets life’s teachings, which are a Father’s correction, with either, has little prospect of getting Wisdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then follows the main part of this section {<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-13.htm" title="Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.">Proverbs 3:13</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm" title="She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and happy is every one that retains her.">Proverbs 3:18</a>},-the praise of Wisdom as in herself most precious, and as bestowing highest good. ‘The man that findeth Wisdom’ reminds us of the peasant in Christ’s parable, who found treasure hidden in a field, and the ‘merchandise’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-14.htm" title="For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.">Proverbs 3:14</a>, of the trader seeking goodly pearls. But the finding in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-13.htm" title="Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.">Proverbs 3:13</a> is not like the rustic’s in the parable, who was seeking nothing when a chance stroke of his plough or kick of his heel laid bare the glittering gold. It is the finding which rewards seeking. The figure of acquiring by trading, like that of the pearl-merchant in the companion parable, implies pains, effort, willingness to part with something in order to attain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The nature of the price is not here in question. We know who has said, ‘I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire.’ We buy heavenly Wisdom when we surrender ourselves. The price is desire to possess, and willingness to accept as an undeserved, unearned gift. But that does not come into view in our lesson. Only this is strongly put in it-that this heavenly Wisdom outshines all jewels, outweighs all wealth, and is indeed the only true riches. ‘Rubies’ is probably rather to be taken as ‘corals,’ which seem to have been very highly prized by the Jews, and, no doubt, found their way to them from the Indian Ocean via the Red Sea. The word rendered ‘things thou canst desire’ is better taken as meaning ‘jewels.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This noble and conclusive depreciation of material wealth in comparison with Wisdom, which is not merely intellectual, but rests on the fear of the Lord, and is goodness as well as understanding, never needed preaching with more emphasis than in our day, when more and more the commercial spirit invades every region of life, and rich men are the aristocrats and envied types of success. When will England and America believe the religion which they profess, and adjust their estimates of the best things accordingly? How many so-called Christian parents would think their son mad if he said, ‘I do not care about getting rich; my goal is to be wise with God’s Wisdom’? How few of us order our lives on the footing of this old teacher’s lesson, and act out the belief that Wisdom is more than wealth! The man who heaps millions together, and masses it, fails in life, however a vulgar world and a nominal church may admire and glorify him. The man who wins Wisdom succeeds, however bare may be his cupboard, and however people may pity him for having failed in life, because he has not drawn prizes in the Devil’s lottery. His blank is a prize, and their prizes are blanks. This decisive subordination of material to spiritual good is too plainly duty and common sense to need being dwelt upon; but, alas! like a great many other most obvious, accepted truths, it is disregarded as universally as believed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The inseparable accompaniments of Wisdom are next eloquently described. The picture is the poetical clothing of the idea that all material good will come to him who despises it all and clasps Wisdom to his heart. Some things flow from Wisdom possessed as usual consequences; some are inseparable from her. The gift in her right hand is length of days; that in her left, which, by its position, is suggested as inferior to the former, is wealth and honour-two goods which will attend the long life. No doubt such promises are to be taken with limitations; but there need be no doubt that, on the whole, loyal devotion to and real possession of heavenly Wisdom do tend in the direction of lengthening lives, which are by it delivered from vices and anxieties which cut many a career short, and of gathering round silver hairs reverence and troops of friends.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> These are the usual consequences, and may be fairly brought into view as secondary encouragements to seek Wisdom. But if she is sought for the sake of getting these attendant blessings, she will not be found. She must be loved for herself, not for her dowry, or she will not be won. At the same time, the overstrained and fantastic morality, which stigmatises regard to the blessed results of a religious life as selfishness, finds no support in Scripture, as it has none in common sense. Would there were more of such selfishness!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Sometimes Wisdom’s hands do not hold these outward gifts. But the connection between her and the next blessings spoken of is inseparable. Her ways are pleasantness and peace. ‘In keeping’-not <span class="ital">for</span> keeping-’her commandments is great reward.’ Inward delight and deep tranquillity of heart attend every step taken in obedience to Wisdom. The course of conduct so prescribed will often involve painful crucifying of the lower nature, but its pleasure far outweighs its pain. It will often be strewn with sharp flints, or may even have red-hot ploughshares laid on it, as in old ordeal trials; but still it will be pleasant to the true self. Sin is a blunder as well as a crime, and enlightened self-interest would point out the same course as the highest law of Wisdom. In reality, duty and delight are co-extensive. They are two names for one thing-one taken from consideration of its obligation; the other, from observation of its issues. ‘Calm pleasures there abide.’ The only complete peace, which fills and quiets the whole man, comes from obeying Wisdom, or what is the same thing, from following Christ. There is no other way of bringing all our nature into accord with itself, ending the war between conscience and inclination, between flesh and spirit. There is no other way of bringing us into amity with all circumstances, so that fortunate or adverse shall be recognised as good, and nothing be able to agitate us very much. Peace with ourselves, the world, and God, is always the consequence of listening to Wisdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The whole fair picture is summed up in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm" title="She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and happy is every one that retains her.">Proverbs 3:18</a> : ‘She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her.’ This is a distinct allusion to the narrative of Genesis. The flaming sword of the cherub guard is sheathed, and access to the tree, which gives immortal life to those who eat, is open to us. Mark how that great word ‘life’ is here gathering to itself at least the beginnings of higher conceptions than those of simple existence. It is swelling like a bud, and preparing to open and disclose the perfect flower, the life which stands in the knowledge of God and the Christ whom He has sent. Jesus, the incarnate Wisdom, is Himself ‘the Tree of Life in the midst of the paradise of God.’ The condition of access to it is ‘laying hold’ by the outstretched hand of faith, and keeping hold with holy obstinacy of grip, in spite of all temptations to slack our grasp. That retaining is the condition of true blessedness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-19.htm" title="The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has he established the heavens.">Proverbs 3:19</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-20.htm" title="By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.">Proverbs 3:20</a> invest the idea of Wisdom with still loftier sublimity, since they declare that it is an attribute of God Himself by which creation came into being. The meaning of the writer is inadequately grasped if we take it to be only that creation shows God’s Wisdom. This personified Wisdom dwells with God, is the agent of creation, comes with invitations to men, may be possessed by them, and showers blessings on them. The planet Neptune was divined before it was discovered, by reason of perturbations in the movements of the exterior members of the system, unaccountable unless some great globe of light, hitherto unseen, were swaying them in their orbits. Do we not see here like influence streaming from the unrisen light of Christ? Personification prepares for Incarnation. There is One who has been with the Father from the beginning, by whom all things came into being, whose voice sounds to all, who is the Tree of Life, whom we may all possess, and with whose own peace we may be peaceful and blessed for evermore.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-21.htm" title="My son, let not them depart from your eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:">Proverbs 3:21</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-24.htm" title="When you lie down, you shall not be afraid: yes, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.">Proverbs 3:24</a> belong to the next section of the great discourse or hymn. They add little to the preceding. But we may observe the earnest exhortation to let wisdom and understanding be ever in sight. Eyes are apt to stray and clouds to hide the sun. Effort is needed to counteract the tendency to slide out of consciousness, which our weakness imposes on the most certain and important truths. A Wisdom which we do not think about is as good or as bad as non-existent for us. One prime condition of healthy spiritual life is the habit of meditation, thereby renewing our gaze upon the facts of God’s revelation and the bearing of these on our conduct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The blessings flowing from Wisdom are again dilated on, from a somewhat different point of view. She is the giver of life. And then she adorns the life she gives. One has seen homely faces so refined and glorified by the fair soul that shone through them as to be, ‘as it were, the face of an angel.’ Gracefulness should be the outward token of inward grace. Some good people forget that they are bound to ‘adorn the doctrine.’ But they who have drunk most deeply of the fountain of Wisdom will find that, like the fabled spring, its waters confer strange loveliness. Lives spent in communion with Jesus will be lovely, however homely their surroundings, and however vulgar eyes, taught only to admire staring colours, may find them dull. The world saw ‘no beauty that they should desire Him,’ in Him whom holy souls and heavenly angels and the divine Father deemed ‘fairer than the sons of men’!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Safety and firm footing in active life will be ours if we walk in Wisdom’s ways. He who follows Christ’s footsteps will tread surely, and not fear foes. Quiet repose in hours of rest will be his. A day filled with happy service will be followed by a night full of calm slumber, ‘Whether we sleep or wake, we live’ with Him; and, if we do both, sleeping and waking will be blessed, and our lives will move on gently to the time when days and nights shall melt into one, and there will be no need for repose; for there will be no work that wearies and no hands that droop. The last lying down in the grave will be attended with no terrors. The last sleep there shall be sweet; for it will really be awaking to the full possession of the personal Wisdom, who is our Christ, our Life in death, our Heaven in heaven.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/proverbs/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/3-11.htm" title="My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:...">Proverbs 3:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord — </span>Either by making light of it, or not being duly affected with it, or by accounting it an unnecessary thing; but rather esteem it a privilege and favour from God. <span class="ital">Neither be weary of his correction — </span>Neither think it tedious or hard, but endure it with patience and cheerfulness. <span class="ital">For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth — </span>Afflictions are not calamities, but benefits and comforts, because they are testimonies of God’s love, which is infinitely more desirable than any evil can be terrible.

The prudence and sobriety which religion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they promote their holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Despise ... be weary - The temper is not that of contempt.

This seems to be introduced to prevent an objection that may be made to the above promise of plenty; seeing the children of God are often afflicted in this world; even the wise and pious, and those that fear the Lord, and honour him; which is accounted for, and the reason of it given, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a>. These words are cited in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>, and are represented as an exhortation, spoken unto children, the children of God; by which it appears, that not any single person is meant by "my son"; and, as not here, so neither elsewhere in this book, where the same phrase is used. It is not to be limited to any son of Solomon's according to the flesh; nor to any person or persons, that applied to him for instruction, and were taught by him; nor to all the people of God in his time: but it has respect to the Jews in the times of the apostles; and even to all the children of God in all ages, who more or less endure afflictions, here called "the chastening of the Lord", because they are from him; whatever concern men or devils, or second causes, may have in them, they are originally from the Lord, either sent or suffered by him; they are indeed by his appointment, and are ordered, limited, and restrained by him, and are overruled for his glory and his people's good: they are not chastisements in a way of vindictive wrath and justice, which would be contrary to the satisfaction of Christ, the justice of God, his everlasting and unchangeable love, and to his word and oath; but they are in love; they are the chastisements of a father, in which he deals with them as with children; and uses them for the good discipline and instruction of them, as the word (r) here signifies; and therefore not to be "despised", or loathed and abhorred, as disagreeable food or physic be; or as if they were unnecessary and unprofitable, or unworthy of notice and regard; or as little, slight, and trifling things, without considering from whence they come and for what they are sent; but, on the contrary, should be regarded as useful and serviceable; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>; <p>neither be weary of his correction; "rebuke" or "reproof" (s); so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>; "when thou art rebuked of him", not in wrath and fury, but in love, as before. The same thing is meant by correction as chastening; and supposes a fault to be committed by him that is corrected, for God corrects none but for sin; and authority in the corrector, which he, as the Father of spirits, and as our covenant God and Father in Christ, has a right to do: he corrects by his Spirit, by his word, by his ministers, and by his providences, afflictive ones, which last is here meant; and it is always for good, at a proper time, and when necessary, in measure and with judgment: and of this the children should not be "weary", as grievous and intolerable; and especially should not be weary of their lives on account of it, in which sense the word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-46.htm">Genesis 27:46</a> which has been the case of Job and others; but should bear it quietly and peaceably, and with patience, without fretting and murmuring; or should not "faint", as it is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>; or sink under the weight, but cheerfully support under it. The two extremes, which men are apt to run into, are here guarded against; on the one hand, to make little or nothing of an affliction; to outbrave it, not to be affected with it, nor humble under the mighty hand of God; nor consider the rod, and him that has appointed it: and, on the other hand, to aggravate an affliction, as if no sorrow was like theirs, and to be quite dejected and overwhelmed with it. <p>(r) "disciplinam", V.

This short paragraph is at once in contrast and in harmony, with what precedes and follows it. It states the contrast that it may introduce the harmony. The pathway of wisdom, so the rest of the chapter insists, is the pathway of temporal prosperity. But the experience of life proves that there is another side to the truth. There is, these verses say, a contradictory side, but it is so in appearance not in reality; for to the childlike follower of wisdom the apparent exceptions and contradictions are but as passing discords and minor strains that lend force and sweetness to the overmastering harmony of love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Christian teaching itself has no better solution than this to give of the mystery of suffering.

The thought of prosperity suggests the opposite one of adversity. Abundant prosperity shall flow from honouring Jehovah, but he sometimes and not unfrequently sends affliction, and, indeed, without this life would be incomplete. The object of the exhortation is, as Delitzsch states, to show that, as in prosperity God should not be forgotten, so one should not suffer himself to be estranged by days of adversity. Submission is counselled on the ground that, when Jehovah afflicts, he does so in the spirit of love, and for good. The "chastening" and "correction," though presenting God in an attitude of anger, are in reality not the punishment of an irate God. The verse before us is evidently copied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-17.htm">Job 5:17</a>, "Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth, therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty;" and the whole passage is cited again in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5, 6</a>). It has been said that ver. 11 expresses the problem of the Book of Job, and ver. 12 its solution (Delitzsch). <span class="accented">Despise not</span> (<span class="accented">al-timas</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne abjicias</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>.

They despise the chastening of Jehovah who, when they see his hand in it, do not humbly and submissively bow, but resist and become refractory, or, as it is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-3.htm">Proverbs 19:3</a>, when their "heart fretteth against the Lord." Job, notwithstanding his bitter complaints, was on the whole, and in his better moments, an example of the proper state of mind under correction (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>). Jonah, in treating contemptuously the procedure of God, is an exemplification of the contrary spirit, which is condemned implicitly in the text (Wardlaw). <span class="accented">Chastening</span> (<span class="accented">musar</span>); i.e. correction not by reproof only, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23</a> and Proverbs 8:30; but by punishment also. as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-15.htm">Proverbs 22:15</a>. The meaning here is expressed by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, which is "instruction by punishment," discipline, or schooling (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">disciplina</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Neither be weary</span> (<span class="accented">al-takots</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not loathe, abhor, feel disgust nor vexation towards. The expression, "do not loathe," is a climax to the other, "despise not." It represents a more deeply seated aversion to Jehovah's plans. Gesenius takes the primary meaning of <span class="accented">kuts</span> to be that of vomiting. The word before us certainly denotes loathing or nausea, and is used in this sense by the Israelites in their complaints against God and against Moses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-5.htm">Numbers 21:5</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-46.htm">Genesis 27:46</a>). The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in quoting the passage, adopts the LXX. reading, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "nor faint;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne deficias, i.e.</span> "do not give way to despondency." <span class="cmt_word">Correction</span>. This word, like <span class="accented">musar</span> above, has a twofold meaning of either punishment or chastening, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-14.htm">Psalm 73:14</a>; or reproof, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-23.htm">Proverbs 1:23</a>; 25:30; 5:12; 27:5; 29:15, where it also occurs. It is here used in the former sense. To loathe the correction of Jehovah is to allow it to completely estrange us from him. We faint under it when, by dwelling on or brooding over, or bemoaning the trial, the spirit sinks to faintness. To faint at correction ignores the belief in the truth that "all things work together for good to them that love God." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Were "kindness and truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>) understood only in relation to men, then the following admonition would not be interposed, since it proceeds from that going before, if there the quality of kindness and truth, not only towards man, but also towards God, is commended:<p>5 Trust in Jahve with thy whole heart,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And lean not on thine own understanding.<p>6 In all thy ways acknowledge Him,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And He will make plain thy paths.<p>7 Be not wise in thine own eyes;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear Jahve, and depart from evil.<p>8 Health will then come to thy navel,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And refreshing to thy bones.<p>From God alone comes true prosperity, true help. He knows the right way to the right ends. He knows what benefits us. He is able to free us from that which does us harm: therefore it is our duty and our safety to place our confidence wholly in Him, and to trust not to our own judgment. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, Arab. bat&#803;h&#803;, has the root-meaning expandere, whence perhaps, by a more direct way than that noted under <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>, it acquires the meaning confidere, to lean with the whole body on something, in order to rest upon it, strengthened by &#1506;&#1500;, if one lean wholly - Fr. se reposer sur quelqu'un; Ital. riposarsi sopra alcuno, - like &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; with &#1488;&#1500;, to lean on anything, so as to be supported by it; with &#1506;&#1500;, to support oneself on anything (Fl.). &#1491;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (the same in form as &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>) is not fully represented by "acknowledge Him;" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a> it is not a mere theoretic acknowledgment that is meant, but earnest penetrating cognizance, engaging the whole man. The practico-mystical &#1491;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, in and of itself full of significance, according to O. and N.T. usage, is yet strengthened by toto corde. The heart is the central seat of all spiritual soul-strength; to love God with the whole heart is to concentrate the whole inner life on the active contemplation of God, and the ready observance of His will. God requites such as show regard to Him, by making plain their path before them, i.e., by leading them directly to the right end, removing all hindrances out of their way. &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; has Cholem in the first syllable (vid., Kimchi's Lex.).<p>(Note: In the st. constr. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-19.htm">Proverbs 2:19</a>, and with the grave suff. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>, o&#780; instead of o&#772; is in order; but Ben-Asher's &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-11.htm">Job 33:11</a>, is an inconsistency.)<p>"Be not wise in thine own eyes" is equivalent to ne tibi sapiens videare; for, as J. H. Michaelis remarks, confidere Deo est sapere, sibi vero ac suae sapientiae, desipere. "Fear God and depart from evil" is the twofold representation of the &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, or practical piety, in the Chokma writings: <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>, the Mashal <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a> cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>.
