It will be found there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperous oppressors; far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any of their ways. These truths may be despised by the covetous and luxurious, but everlasting contempt will be the portion of such scorners, while Divine favour is shown to the humble believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Procrastination is especially fatal to the giving impulse.

Either to whom thou art indebted, and who comes for the payment of a just debt; or to any poor and indigent person that applies for alms: <p>go, and come again, and tomorrow I will give; go home, and come tomorrow, and I will pay thee what I owe thee; or do not trouble me now, come another time, and perhaps I may relieve thy wants: this should not be said, because a man cannot be sure of tomorrow that he shall ever see it; nor may it be in the power of his hands, should he live unto the morrow, to do as he promises; his substance may be taken from him; and besides, in the mean time, the poor object may perish for want of relief; <p>when thou hast it by thee; money to pay thy debts with, or to give alms to the poor; and therefore should give readily and at once, and not make any excuses and delays; "bis dat, qui cito dat". Some make this to be part of the covetous man's words, saying, "and there is with thee"; or thou hast enough, thou hast no need to ask of me; thou hast what thou askest; thou art not in want; thou art richer than I; but the other sense is best. The Septuagint and Arabic versions add, <p>"for thou knowest not what the day following may bring forth;'' <p>or may happen on it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>.

We may compare Seneca’s saying, “ingratum est beneficium, quod diu inter manus dantis hæsit; nam qui tarde fecit, diu noluit.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - The precept of this and that of the preceding verse are very closely related. The former precept enjoined the general principle of benevolence when we have the means; this carries on the idea, and is directed against the postponement of giving when we are in a position to give. In effect it says, "Do not defer till tomorrow what you can do today." This "putting off" may arise from avarice, from indolence, or from insolence and contempt. These underlying faults, which are incompatible with neighbourly good wilt, are condenmed by implication. <span class="cmt_word">Unto thy neighbour;</span> <span class="accented">l'reayka</span>, "to thy friends," the word being evidently used distributively. <span class="accented">Reeh</span> is "a companion" or "friend" (cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">amico tuo</span>; Syriac, <span class="accented">sodali tuo</span>), and generally any other person, equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "neighbour." The Authorized Version correctly renders "come again," as <span class="accented">shav</span> is not merely  "to return," but to return again to something (so Delitzsch); cf. Vulgate, <span class="accented">revertere</span>; and as the words, "tomorrow I will give thee," show. The LXX. adds, "For thou knowest not what the morrow may bring forth," probably from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a>. If viewed in respect of the specific claims which servants have for work done, the precept is a re-echo of Leviticus 29:13 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-15.htm">Deuteronomy 24:15</a>. In illustration of the general scope of the passage, Grotius quotes, "A slow-footed favour is a favour without favour." Seneca says in the same spirit, "Ingratum est beneficium quod diu inter manus dantis haesit," "The benefit is thankless which sticks long between the hands of the giver" (Seneca, 'Benef.,' 1:2); cf. also <span class="accented">Bis dat qui cito dat.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From this eminence, in which the work of creation presents wisdom, exhortations are now deduced, since the writer always expresses himself only with an ethical intention regarding the nature of wisdom:<p>21 My son, may they not depart from thine eyes - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preserve thoughtfulness and consideration,<p>22 And they will be life to thy soul<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And grace to thy neck.<p>If we make the synonyms of wisdom which are in 21b the subject per prolepsin to &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1500;&#1494;&#1493;&#1468; (Hitzig and Zckler), then <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19-20</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-21.htm">Proverbs 3:21-22</a> clash.
