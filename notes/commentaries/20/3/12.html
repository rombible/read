The prudence and sobriety which religion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they promote their holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The first distinct utterance of a truth which has been so full of comfort to many thousands; it is the summing up of all controversies (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-2.htm">John 9:2</a>) as to the mystery of suffering.

They show God’s purpose, and desire, and care to purge us from our sins, and to make us fit for his presence and kingdom. This and the former verse seem to be here inserted in the midst of his commendations of wisdom, to remove an objection against the excellency and happiness of wise or pious men, taken from those many calamities to which such persons are frequently exposed, the reason of which providence he here giveth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth,.... This is a reason why the children of God should not despise corrections, nor be weary of them; since they spring from love, are given in love, nor is there any abatement of it in them: when the Lord chastens and corrects, he does not take away his lovingkindness from them; yea, it is because he loves them that therefore he thus deals with them; wherefore they ought to be patiently bore, and kindly taken by them; <p>even as a father the son in whom he delighteth; as a father chastens and corrects his son, whom he dearly loves, and has the greatest pleasure in, so the Lord chastens and corrects his people; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>. There is such a relation subsisting between them as that of father and son, which flows from the inexpressible love of God to them; and which is a love of complacency and delight in them, and is invariable and unchangeable, and continues the same under all their afflictions; as appears by what he does for them in them, and by the issue of them; he knows their souls in adversity, and chooses them in the furnace of affliction; he pays love visits to them, and comforts them under all their tribulation; he sympathizes with them, and supports them; he makes their bed in their affliction, and delivers out of it, or takes them to himself: the issue is always his own glory, and their good. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">even as a father</span> &c.] The LXX.

They are corrections, but they are the corrections of love. One of the most touching relationships of life, and that with which we are most familiar, viz. that of father and son, is employed to reconcile us to Jehovah's afflictive dispensations. A comparison is drawn. God corrects those whom he loves after the same manner as a father corrects ("correcteth" has to be understood from the first hemistich) the  son whom he loves. The idea of the passage is evidently taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a>, "Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that as a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee." The idea of the paternal relationship of God to mankind is found elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>), and especially finds expression in the Lord's prayer. When the truth of this passage is learned, we shall be drawn to, rather than repelled from, God by his corrections. The gracious end of earthly trials is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6, 2</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a> (Wardlaw). "These gracious words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12</a>.) are written in Holy Scripture for our comfort and instruction; that we should patiently and with thanksgiving bear our heavenly Father's correction, whensoever by any manner of adversity it shall please his gracious goodness to visit us" (see Visitation Office). <span class="cmt_word">Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth</span> (<span class="accented">vuk'av eth-ben yir'tseh</span>); literally, <span class="accented">even as a father the son be delighteth in.</span> Various renderings have been given to this passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Delitzsch, De Wette, <span class="accented">et al.</span>, agree with the Authorized Version, and take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> <span class="accented">vav, as</span> explicative, and <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, "in whom he delighteth," as a relative sentence. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> is used in this explanatory sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a> (see Gesenius, &sect; 155, 1 <span class="accented">a</span>). The relative <span class="accented">usher</span>, "whom," is omitted in the original, according to the rule that the relative is omitted, especially in poetry, where it would stand as a pronoun in the nominative or accusative case (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-16.htm">Psalm 7:16</a>, "And he falls into the pit (which) he made;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-13.htm">Proverbs 5:13</a>). We have the same elision of the relative in the English colloquial expression, "the friend I met" (see Gesenius, &sect; 123:3, <span class="accented">a</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hitzig and Zockler translate, "and holds him dear as a father his son." This, though grammatically correct, does not preserve the parallelism. It serves only to expand the idea of love, whereas the predominant idea of the verse is that of correction, to which love is an accessory idea (see Delitzsch). For similar parallels, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-5.htm">Deuteronomy 8:5</a> as before, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>. In the comparison which is instituted, <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, "in whom he delighteth," corresponds with <span class="accented">eth asher ye'hav y'hovah</span>, "whom the Lord loveth," and not with <span class="accented">yokiah</span>, "correcteth." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Kamph translates, "and (dealeth) as a father (who) wisheth well to his son." This is substantially the same as the Authorized Version, except that in the relative sentence "son" is made accusative after <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span>, here translated, "wisheth well to," and the emitted relative (<span class="accented">asher</span>) is placed in the nominative instead of the accusative case. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The variation in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "and scourgeth every son whom he rcceiveth," cited literally in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>, evidently arises from the translators having read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, (<span class="accented">yakev</span>), "he scourgeth" for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">vuk'av</span>), "even as a father." It will be seen that this alteration could be easily effected by a change in the Masoretic pointing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">et quasi pater in filio complacet sibi. He delighteth</span>; <span class="accented">yir'tseh</span> is from <span class="accented">ratsah</span>, "to be delighted" with any person or thing. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Were "kindness and truth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-3.htm">Proverbs 3:3</a>) understood only in relation to men, then the following admonition would not be interposed, since it proceeds from that going before, if there the quality of kindness and truth, not only towards man, but also towards God, is commended:<p>5 Trust in Jahve with thy whole heart,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And lean not on thine own understanding.<p>6 In all thy ways acknowledge Him,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And He will make plain thy paths.<p>7 Be not wise in thine own eyes;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear Jahve, and depart from evil.<p>8 Health will then come to thy navel,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And refreshing to thy bones.<p>From God alone comes true prosperity, true help. He knows the right way to the right ends. He knows what benefits us. He is able to free us from that which does us harm: therefore it is our duty and our safety to place our confidence wholly in Him, and to trust not to our own judgment. The verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, Arab. bat&#803;h&#803;, has the root-meaning expandere, whence perhaps, by a more direct way than that noted under <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/4-6.htm">Psalm 4:6</a>, it acquires the meaning confidere, to lean with the whole body on something, in order to rest upon it, strengthened by &#1506;&#1500;, if one lean wholly - Fr. se reposer sur quelqu'un; Ital. riposarsi sopra alcuno, - like &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; with &#1488;&#1500;, to lean on anything, so as to be supported by it; with &#1506;&#1500;, to support oneself on anything (Fl.). &#1491;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (the same in form as &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>) is not fully represented by "acknowledge Him;" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a> it is not a mere theoretic acknowledgment that is meant, but earnest penetrating cognizance, engaging the whole man. The practico-mystical &#1491;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, in and of itself full of significance, according to O. and N.T. usage, is yet strengthened by toto corde. The heart is the central seat of all spiritual soul-strength; to love God with the whole heart is to concentrate the whole inner life on the active contemplation of God, and the ready observance of His will. God requites such as show regard to Him, by making plain their path before them, i.e., by leading them directly to the right end, removing all hindrances out of their way. &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1498; has Cholem in the first syllable (vid., Kimchi's Lex.).<p>(Note: In the st. constr. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-19.htm">Proverbs 2:19</a>, and with the grave suff. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>, o&#780; instead of o&#772; is in order; but Ben-Asher's &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/13-27.htm">Job 13:27</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/33-11.htm">Job 33:11</a>, is an inconsistency.)<p>"Be not wise in thine own eyes" is equivalent to ne tibi sapiens videare; for, as J. H. Michaelis remarks, confidere Deo est sapere, sibi vero ac suae sapientiae, desipere. "Fear God and depart from evil" is the twofold representation of the &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, or practical piety, in the Chokma writings: <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>, the Mashal <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm">Job 28:28</a> cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>.
