Do not contrive and form schemes in thy mind and thoughts to do him any injury, in his name and character, in his person, property, or family: a good man should devise all the good he can to his fellow creatures, but not evil to any; especially to his neighbour, and as described in the next clause; <p>seeing he dwelleth securely by thee; having a good opinion of thee, and not suspecting any ill design against him, thinks himself, goods, and family, in safety; and is under no concern to provide for his security, placing his confidence in thee, and perhaps to such a degree as to entrust with his secrets.

The meaning of this expression lies between "fabricating evil" and "ploughing evil." The radical meaning of <span class="accented">kharash</span>, from which <span class="accented">takharosh</span>, is "to cut into," "to inscribe" letters on a tablet, cognate with the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to cut into." But it is used in the sense of "to plough" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>, "They that plough iniquity (<span class="accented">khar'shey aven</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>, "The ploughers ploughed (<span class="accented">khar'shim khar'shim</span>) upon my back" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-13.htm">Hosea 10:13</a>). This also appears from the context to be the meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>. With these we may compare such expressions as "to plough a lie" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, rendered in the Authorized Version, "Devise not a lie"); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a>, and "to sow iniquity," <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-8.htm">Proverbs 22:8</a> - a cognate figure. "To plough evil" is to devise evil, to prepare for it, just in the same way as a ploughman prepares the land for sowing. In this sense the verb is understood by the older commentators and by Ewald and Delitzsch. On the other hand, the verb may be used in its other signification, "to fabricate," and hence "to contrive." The noun <span class="accented">kharash</span> is an artificer of iron, etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-35.htm">Exodus 35:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>). "To fabricate evil" is, of course, as the Authorized Version "to devise evil." The LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1fc4;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to build," inclines to this sense. The Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne moliaris</span>, does not clear up the point, though <span class="accented">moliri</span>, usually "to contrive," is used by Virgil, 'Georg.,' 1:494, "moliri terrain," of working or tilling the ground. The verb also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-20.htm">Proverbs 12:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the Vulgate, <span class="accented">cure ille in te habet fiduciam</span>, "when he has confidence in thee;" so the LXX.; or, as the Targum and Syriac, "when he dwells with thee in peace." <span class="accented">To dwell</span> (<span class="accented">yashar</span>) is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a> "to sit with any one," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to associate familiarly with him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-4.htm">Psalm 26:4, 5</a>); but it also has the meaning , "to dwell," and the participle <span class="accented">yoshev</span>, here used; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-23.htm">Genesis 19:23</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-21.htm">Judges 6:21</a>, means "an inhabitant, a dweller." <span class="accented">Securely</span> (<span class="accented">lavetah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with full trust (see on ver. 23). Devising evil against a friend is at any time reprehensible, but to do so when he confides in and is altogether unsuspicious of you, is an act of the greatest treachery, and an outrage on all law. human and Divine. It implies dissimulation. It is the very sin by which "the devil beguiled Eve through his subtlety" (Wardlaw). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But more than this, wisdom makes its possessor in all situations of life confident in God:<p>23 Then shalt thou go thy way with confidence,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy foot shall not stumble.<p>24 When thou liest down, thou are not afraid,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou layest thyself down and hast sweet sleep.<p>25 Thou needest not be afraid of sudden alarm,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor for the storm of the wicked when it breaketh forth.<p>26 For Jahve will be thy confidence<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keep thy foot from the snare.<p>The &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1495; (cf. our "bei guter Laune"  equals  in good cheer), with &#1500; of the condition, is of the same meaning as the conditional adverbial accusative &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-33.htm">Proverbs 1:33</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-23.htm">Proverbs 3:23</a> the lxx translate &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#837;, while, on the contrary, at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-12.htm">Psalm 91:12</a> they make the person the subject (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;.); here also we retain more surely the subject from 23a, especially since for the intrans. of &#1504;&#1490;&#1507; (to smite, to push) a Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1490;&#1468;&#1507; is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>.

Schultens rightly says: Subest species prohibitionis et tanquam abominationis, ne tale quicquam vel in suspicionem veniat in mentemve cogitando admittatur. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; here means terror, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26</a>., the terrific object; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1501; (with the accus. om) is the virtual genitive, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-2.htm">Proverbs 26:2</a> &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; (with accus. am). Regarding &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>. The genitive &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; may be, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-18.htm">Psalm 37:18</a>, the genit. subjecti, but still it lies nearer to say that he who chooses the wisdom of God as his guiding star has no ground to fear punishment as transgressors have reason to fear it; the &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; is meant which wisdom threatens against transgressors, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>. He needs have no fear of it, for wisdom is a gift of God, and binds him who receives it to the giver: Jahve becomes and is henceforth his confidence. Regarding &#1489; essentiae, which expresses the closest connection of the subject with the predicate which it introduces, see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>. As here, so also at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a>, the predicate is a noun with a pronominal suffix. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; is, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-7.htm">Psalm 78:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-24.htm">Job 31:24</a>, cognate to &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492;,<p>(Note: According to Malbim, &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; is the expectation of good, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;, confidence in the presence of evil.)<p>the object and ground of confidence. That the word in other connections may mean also fool-hardiness, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>, and folly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a> (cf. regarding &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, which in Arab. as bel&#305;&#770;d denotes the dull, in Hebr. fools, see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>), it follows that it proceeds from the fundamental conception of fulness of flesh and of fat, whence arise the conceptions of dulness and slothfulness, as well as of confidence, whether confidence in self or in God (see Schultens l.c., and Wnsche's Hosea, p. 207f.). &#1500;&#1499;&#1491; is taking, catching, as in a net or trap or pit, from &#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, to catch (cf. Arab. lakida, to fasten, III, IV to hold fast); another root-meaning, in which Arab. lak connects itself with nak, nk, to strike, to assail (whence al-lakdat, the assault against the enemy, Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitsch. xxii. 140), is foreign to the Hebr. Regarding the &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, Fleischer remarks: "The &#1502;&#1503; after the verbs of guarding, preserving, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; and &#1504;&#1510;&#1512;, properly expresses that one by those means holds or seeks to hold a person or thing back from something, like the Lat. defendere, tueri aliquem ab hostibus, a perculo."<p>(Note: Hitzig rejects <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-22.htm">Proverbs 3:22-26</a> as a later interpolation. And why? Because chap. 3, which he regards as a complete discourse, consists of twice ten verses beginning with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;. In addition to this symmetry other reasons easily reveal themselves to his penetration. But the discourses contained in chap. 1-9 do not all begin with &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>); and when it stands in the beginning of the discourse, it is not always the first word (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>); and when it occurs as the first word or in the first line, it does not always commence a new discourse (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-15.htm">Proverbs 1:15</a> in the middle of the first, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a> in the middle of the fourth); and, moreover, the Hebr. poetry and oratory does not reckon according to verses terminated by Soph Pasuk, which are always accented distichs, but they in reality frequently consist of three or more lines. The rejected verses are in nothing unlike those that remain, and which are undisputed; they show the same structure of stichs, consisting for the most part of three, but sometimes also only of two words (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-22.htm">Proverbs 3:22</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>), the same breadth in the course of the thoughts, and the same accord with Job and Deuteronomy.) </body></html>
