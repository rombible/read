Give it a better life than it naturally has, though immortal; Christ is both the spiritual and eternal life of the souls of those that look unto him by faith; and his Gospel, and the doctrines of it, are the means of reviving drooping saints, and of quickening them to the discharge of their duty; wherefore both he and they should be kept in continual view, and held fast; <p>and grace to thy neck; an ornament to that and to the whole man; how ornamental is Christ and his righteousness to a believer! how lovely is the person that is steady in his principles, and regular in his practices! who stands fast in the truths of the Gospel, and whose conversation is as becomes it! see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So shall they he life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</span> <span class="accented">So shall they be</span> (<span class="accented">n'yikva</span>); <span class="accented">and they shall be.</span> The "soul" and "neck" stand for the whole man in his twofold nature, internal and external. Life is in its highest and widest sense given to the soul (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-22.htm">Proverbs 4:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>), and favour is conferred on the man, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he becomes acceptable to his neighbours, if he has wisdom. The latter expression is very similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>, where the same promise is expressed, "grace" (<span class="accented">hon</span>) being equivalent to "ornament of grace" (<span class="accented">liv'yath hon</span>). Others understand "grace to thy neck" (<span class="accented">hon l'garg</span> <span class="accented">grotheyka</span>), as <span class="accented">gratia guttturis</span>, in the sense of "grace of the lips," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-3.htm">Psalm 45:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-11.htm">Proverbs 22:11</a>, that is, as the grace of speaking, power of eloquent and effective utterance (Gejerus, Bayne, Lapide). It is better to take it as referring to the adornment of the personal character, and so by metonymy of the favour and kindness which it procures. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>That wisdom is of such incomparable value is here confirmed:<p>16 Length of days is in her right hand;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In her left, riches and honour.<p>17 Her ways are pleasant ways,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all her paths are peace.<p>18 A tree of life is she to those that lay hold upon her,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he who always holdeth her fast is blessed.<p>As in the right hand of Jahve, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>, are pleasures for evermore, so Wisdom holds in her right hand "length of days," viz., of the days of life, thus life, the blessing of blessings; in her left, riches and honour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-18.htm">Proverbs 8:18</a>), the two good things which, it is true, do not condition life, but, received from Wisdom, and thus wisely, elevate the happiness of life-in the right hand is the chief good, in the left the &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>.
