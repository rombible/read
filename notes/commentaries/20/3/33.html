In the verse before us a further reason is given why the prosperity of the wicked is not enviable. The curse of Jehovah dwells in and rests upon his house. <span class="accented">The curse</span>; <span class="accented">m'erah</span>, from <span class="accented">arav</span>, "to curse." This word only occurs five times in the Old Testament once in Deuteronomy, twice in Proverbs (here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-27.htm">Proverbs 28:27</a>), and twice in Malachi. The nature of the curse may be learned from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20</a>, where it is the infliction of temporal misfortunes ending with the "cutting off" of the wicked (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-22.htm">Psalm 37:22</a>). It is a hovering evil, the source of constant misfortune. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. Cf. "the cursing" (<span class="accented">alah</span>) against thieves and swearers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-4.htm">Zechariah 5:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">But he blesseth the habitation the just.</span> The contrast to the former, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2-6</a>. <span class="accented">He blesseth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> both temporarily and spiritually. Blessing does not exclude affliction, but "trials" are not "curses" (Wardlaw). Both the LXX. and the Vulgate render, "But the habitations of the just shall be blessed," the LXX. having read the pual future (<span class="accented">y'vorak</span>), "they shall be blessed," for the piel future (<span class="accented">y'varik</span>), "he shall bless," of the text. <span class="accented">The habitation</span>; <span class="accented">naveh</span>, from <span class="accented">navah</span>, "to sit down," "to dwell." A poetic and nomad (Fleischer) word usually understood of a small dwelling is <span class="accented">tugurium</span>, the shepherd's hut or cottage, "the sheepcote" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-20.htm">Proverbs 21:20</a> and Proverbs 24:15 the word is rendered "dwelling." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first illustration of neighbourly love which is recommended, is readiness to serve:<p>27 Refuse no manner of good to him to whom it is due<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it is in thy power to do it.<p>28 Say not to thy neighbour, "Go, and come again,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To-morrow I will give it," whilst yet thou hast it.<p>Regarding the intensive plur. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; with a sing. meaning, see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>. The form of expression without the suffix is not &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; but &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;; and this denotes here, not him who does good (&#1489;&#1506;&#1500; as Arab. dhw or s&#803;ah&#803;ab), but him to whom the good deed is done (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-8.htm">Proverbs 17:8</a>), i.e., as here, him who is worthy of it (&#1489;&#1506;&#1500; as Arab. a&#770;hl), him who is the man for it (Jewish interp.: &#1502;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497; &#1500;&#1493;). We must refuse nothing good (nothing either legally or morally good) to him who has a right to it (&#1502;&#1504;&#1506; &#1502;&#1503; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-7.htm">Job 22:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-16.htm">Job 31:16</a>),<p>(Note: Accentuate &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1506; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, not &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1506;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;. The doubling of the Makkeph is purposeless, and, on the contrary, the separating of &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; from &#1502;&#1489;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; by the Dechi (the separating accent subordinate to Athnach) is proper. It is thus in the best MSS.)<p>if we are in a condition to do him this good. The phrase &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&#1500;&#1488;&#1500; &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-29.htm">Genesis 31:29</a>, and frequently, signifies: it is belonging to (practicable) the power of my hand, i.e., I have the power and the means of doing it. As &#1494;&#1491; signifies the haughty, insolent, but may be also used in the neuter of insolent conduct (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-14.htm">Psalm 19:14</a>), so &#1488;&#1500; signifies the strong, but also (although only in this phrase) strength. The Keri rejects the plur. &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1498;, because elsewhere the hand always follows &#1500;&#1488;&#1500; in the singular. But it rejects the plur. &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28</a>) because the address following is directed to one person. Neither of these emendations was necessary. The usage of the language permits exceptions, notwithstanding the usus tyrannus, and the plur. &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; may be interpreted distributively: to thy fellows, it may be this one or that one. Hitzig also regards &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; as a singular; but the masc. of &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1492;, the ground-form of which is certainly ra&#8219;j, is &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, or shorter, &#1512;&#1506;. &#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; does not mean: forth! go home again! but: go, and come again. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, to come again, to return to something, to seek it once more.<p>(Note: Thus also (Arab.) raj' is used in Thaalebi's Confidential Companion, p. 24, line 3, of Flgel's ed. Admission was prevented to one Haschmid, then angry he sought it once more; he was again rejected, then he sought it not again (Arab. flm yraj'), but says, etc. Flgel has misunderstood the passage. Fleischer explains raj', with reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28</a>, by revenir  la charge.)<p>The &#1493; of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; is, as 29b, the conditional: quum sit penes te, sc. quod ei des. "To-morrow shall I give" is less a promise than a delay and putting off, because it is difficult for him to alienate himself from him who makes the request. This holding fast by one's own is unamiable selfishness; this putting off in the fulfilment of one's duty is a sin of omission - &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, as the lxx adds, &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;. </body></html>
