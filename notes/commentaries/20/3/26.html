The object of it, in whom thou shall put thy confidence, and be safe and secure from all fear and danger: or "the Lord shall be in thy confidence" (g); shall support thee in it, and maintain that, so that thou shalt not cast it away; the word used has sometimes the notion off oily in it, and Jarchi, from the Jerusalem Talmud, produces a sense agreeable to it; <p>"the Lord shall be in things in which thou art foolish;'' <p>which, how absurd it may seem to be, will admit of a good interpretation; that the Lord will be with Wisdom's followers in things which may seem foolishness to the world; as Christ, the things of Christ, and the things of the Spirit of Christ, the Gospel, and the doctrines of it, are. The Targum is, <p>"the Lord shall be thine help,'' <p>in all times of distress, difficulty, and danger; <p>and shall keep thy foot from being taken; in the snares of sin, temptation, and mischief; in those which Satan and the world lay for God's people; from these the Lord preserves them; wherefore happy are those that have an interest in Christ, who find and enjoy him. <p>(g) So Montanus, Vatablus, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy confidence</span> (<span class="accented">v'kis'leka</span>); literally, <span class="accented">as thy confidence. Kesel</span>, primarily "loin" or "flank," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-14.htm">Leviticus 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-15.htm">Leviticus 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-27.htm">Job 15:27</a>, is apparently used here in its secondary meaning of "confidence," "hope," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/8-14.htm">Job 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-24.htm">Job 31:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-7.htm">Psalm 78:7</a>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">v</span>') prefixed is what is usually termed the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> <span class="accented">essentiae</span>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> <span class="accented">pleonasticum</span> (equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">tanquam</span>, "as"), and serves to emphasize the connection between the predicate "thy confidence" and the subject "Jehovah" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; see Ewaht, 'Lehrb.,' 217<span class="accented">, f.</span>; and Gesenius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 154). Jehovah shall be in the highest sense your ground and object of confidence. Delitzsch describes <span class="accented">kesel</span> as confidence in the presence of evil: Jehovah in the presence of the "sudden fear," and of "the desolation of the wicked," the evils and calamities which overwhelm the wicked, shall be thy confidence. The sense of his all-encircling protection will render you undismayed. The meaning given to <span class="accented">kesel</span> as "foolhardiness" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>) and "folly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>). and the connection of <span class="accented">kesel</span> with <span class="accented">k'silim</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>, comes from the root idea <span class="accented">kasal</span>, "to be fleshly, or fat," the signification of which branches out on the one side into strength and boldness, and on the other into languor and inertness, and so folly or confidence in self (Schultens, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>). The Talmudic rendering of the Rabbi Salomon approximates to this meaning, "and the things in which you seemed to be foolish (<span class="accented">desipere videbaris</span>) he will be at once present with you." Others, as Ziegler, Muentinghe, gave <span class="accented">kesel</span> its primary meaning, and translate, "Jehovah shall be as thy loins," the loins being regarded as the emblem of strength. Jehovah shall be your strength. But <span class="accented">kesel</span> does not appear to have this local application here. Wherever it is used in this sense, as in Job and Leviticus cited above, there is something in the context to point it out as a part of the body. Compare, however, the Vulgate. <span class="accented">in latere suo</span>, "in thy side or flank." The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "over all thy ways." From being taken (<span class="accented">millaked</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">ne capiaris</span>, "lest thou be taken." The meaning is, Jehovah will be your protection against all the snares and traps which the impious lay for you. <span class="accented">Leked</span>, "a being taken," is from <span class="accented">lakad</span>, "to take or catch animals" in a net or in snares. It only occurs here in the Proverbs. Its unusual appearance, together with other reasons, not tenable, however, has led Hitzig to reject vers. 22-26 as an interpolation.  The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, pavorem. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in Plato, Aristotle, and Plutarch, is used subjectively, and means "any vehement emotion." The word only occurs once in the New Testament in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-6.htm">1 Peter 3:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, where it is evidently quoted from the passage before us, in an objective sense, and designates some external cause of terror (cf. Authorized Version, "and be not afraid with any amazement;" see also Book of Common Prayer: 'Solemnization of Matrimony,' <span class="accented">ad fin</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It is incorrect to understand 20a, with the Targ., of division, i.e., separating the water under the firmament from the water above the firmament; &#1504;&#1489;&#1511;&#1506; is spoken of water, especially of its breaking forth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a>, properly dividing itself out, i.e., welling forth from the bowels of the earth; it means, without distinguishing the primordial waters and the later water-floods confined within their banks (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6-8</a>), the overflowing of the earth for the purpose of its processes of cultivation and the irrigation of the land. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;  equals  &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, to groan, to roar) are chiefly the internal water stores of the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-7.htm">Psalm 33:7</a>. But while 20a is to be understood of the waters under the firmament, 20b is to be interpreted of those above. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1511;, Arab. sh&#803;ak&#803;, comminuere, attenuare) properly designates the uppermost stratum of air thinly and finely stretching itself far and wide, and then poetically the clouds of heaven (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>). Another name, &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1501;, comes from &#1506;&#1512;&#1507;, which is transposed from &#1512;&#1506;&#1507; (here used in 20b), Arab. r'af, to drop, to run. The &#1496;&#1500; added on the object accusative represents synecdochically all the waters coming down from heaven and fructifying the earth. This watering proceeds from above (&#1493;&#1512;&#1506;&#1508;&#1493;); on the contrary, the endowing of the surface of the earth with great and small rivers is a fundamental fact in creation (&#1504;&#1489;&#1511;&#1506;&#1493;). </body></html>
