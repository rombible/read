The underlying axiom is that, in a world ruled by a good Being, obedience must lead to well-being; but while that is in the general true, exceptions do occur, and good men do encounter evil times. Therefore the glowing promises of these verses are followed by two verses which deal with the explanation of good men’s afflictions, as being results and tokens of God’s fatherly love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The first couplet is general in character. It inculcates obedience to the precepts of the teacher, and gives as reason the assurance that thereby long life and peace will be secured. True to the Old Testament conception of revelation as a law, the teacher sets obedience in the forefront. He is sure that his teaching contains the sufficient guide for conduct, and coincides with the divine will. He calls, in the first instance, for inward willing acceptance of His commandments; for it is the heart, not primarily the hands, which he desires should ‘keep’ them. The mother of all graces of conduct is the bowing of the will to divine authority. The will is the man, and where it ceases to lift itself up in self-sacrificing and self-determining rebellion, and dissolves into running waters of submission, these will flow through the life and make it pure. To obey self is sin, to obey God is righteousness. The issues of such obedience are ‘length of days . . . and peace.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Even if we allow for the difference between the Old and the New Testaments, it remains true that a life conformed to God’s will tends to longevity, and that many forms of sin do shorten men’s days. Passion and indulged appetites eat away the very flesh, and many a man’s ‘bones are full of the sin of his youth.’ The profligate has usually ‘a short life,’ whether he succeeds in making it ‘merry’ or not.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Peace’ is a wide word, including all well-being. Ease-loving Orientals, especially when living in warlike times, naturally used the phrase as a shorthand expression for all good. Busy Westerns, torn by the distractions and rapid movement of modern life, echo the sigh for repose which breathes in the word. ‘There is no joy but calm,’ and the sure way to deepest peace is to give up self-will and live in obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second couplet deals with our relations to one another, and puts forward the two virtues of ‘loving-kindness and truth’-that is truth, or faithfulness-as all-inclusive. They are the two which are often jointly ascribed to God, especially in the Psalms. Our attitude to one another should be moulded in God’s to us all. The tiniest crystal has the same facets and angles as the largest. The giant hexagonal pillars of basalt, like our Scottish Staffa, are identical in form with the microscopic crystals of the same substance. God is our Pattern; goodness is likeness to Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> These graces are to be bound about the neck, perhaps as an ornament, but more probably as a yoke by which the harnessed ox draws its burden. If we have them, they will fit us to bear one another’s burdens, and will lead to all human duties to our fellows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> These graces are also to be written on the ‘table of the heart’; that is, are to be objects of habitual meditation with aspiration. If so, they will come to sight in life. He who practises them will ‘find favour with God and man,’ for God looks with complacency on those who display the right attitude to men; and men for the most part treat us as we treat them. There are surly natures which are not won by kindness, like black tarns among the hills, that are gloomy even in sunshine, and requite evil for good; but the most of men reflect our feelings to them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Good understanding’ is another result. It is ‘found’ when it is attributed to us, so that the expression substantially means that the possessors of these graces will win the reputation of being really wise, not only in the fallible judgment of men, but before the pure eyes of the all-seeing God. Really wise policy coincides with loving-kindness and truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The remaining couplets refer to our relations to God. The New Testament is significantly anticipated in the pre-eminence given to trust; that is, faith. Nor less significant and profound is the association of self-distrust with trust in the Lord. The two things are inseparable. They are but the under and upper sides of one thing, or like the two growths that come from a seed-one striking downwards becomes the root; one piercing upwards becomes the stalk. The double attitude of trust and distrust finds expression in acknowledging Him in all our ways; that is, ordering our conduct under a constant consciousness of His presence, in accordance with His will, and in dependence on His help.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Such a relation to God will certainly, and with no exceptions, issue in His ‘directing our paths,’ by which is meant that He will be not only our Guide, but also our Roadmaker, showing us the way and clearing obstacles from it. Calm certitude follows on willingness to accept God’s will, and whoever seeks only to go where God sends him will neither be left doubtful whither he should go, nor find his road blocked.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The fourth couplet is, in its first part, in inverted parallelism with the third; for it begins with self-distrust, and proceeds thence to ‘fear of the Lord,’ which corresponds to, and is, in fact, but one phase of, trust in Him. It is the reverent awe which has no torment, and is then purest when faith is strongest. It necessarily leads to departing from evil. Morality has its roots in religion. There is no such magnet to draw men from sin as the happy fear of God, which is likewise faith. Whoever separates devoutness from purity of life, this teacher does not. He knows nothing of religion which permits association with iniquity. Such conduct will tend to physical well-being, and in a deeper sense will secure soundness of life. Godlessness is the true sickness. He only is healthy who has a healthy, because healed, soul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The fifth couplet appears at first as being a drop to a lower region. A regulation of the Mosaic law may strike some as out of place here. But it is to be remembered that our modern distinction of ceremonial and moral law was non-existent for Israel, and that the command has a wider application than to Jewish tithes. To ‘honour God with our substance’ is not necessarily to give it away for religious purposes, but to use it devoutly and as He approves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Christianity has more to say about the distribution, as well as the acquisition, of wealth, than professing Christians, especially in commercial communities, practically recognise. This precept grips us tight, and is much more than a ceremonial regulation. Many causes besides the devout use of property tend to wealth in our highly artificial state of society. The world tries to get it by shrewdness, unscrupulousness, and by many other vices which are elevated to the rank of virtues; but he who honours the Lord in getting and spending will generally have as much as his true needs and regulated desires require.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/proverbs/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/3-1.htm" title="My son, forget not my law; but let your heart keep my commandments:...">Proverbs 3:1-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">My son, forget not my law — </span>My doctrine or counsel; <span class="ital">but let thy heart keep, </span>&c. — By diligent meditation and hearty affection. <span class="ital">For length of days, </span>&c. — God will add these blessings which he hath promised to the obedient, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-18.htm" title="But you shall remember the LORD your God: for it is he that gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-20.htm" title="That you may love the LORD your God, and that you may obey his voice, and that you may hold to him: for he is your life, and the length of your days: that you may dwell in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm" title="For bodily exercise profits little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.">1 Timothy 4:8</a>. <span class="ital">Let not mercy and truth forsake thee — </span>That mercy and truth, which are man’s duty. <span class="ital">Mercy </span>denotes all benignity, charity, and readiness to do good to others; <span class="ital">truth, </span>or <span class="ital">faithfulness, </span>respects all those duties which we owe to God or man, on the principles of justice, and to which we are laid under special obligations by the rules of it. <span class="ital">Bind them about thy neck — </span>Like a chain, wherewith persons were wont to adorn their necks. <span class="ital">Write them upon the table, </span>&c. — In thy mind and heart, in which all God’s commands are to be received and engraven. <span class="ital">So shalt thou find favour </span>— That is, obtain acceptance, <span class="ital">and good understanding — </span>Whereby to know thy duty, and to discern between good and evil; <span class="ital">in the sight of God and man — </span>Grace or favour with God, and that understanding which is good in his sight, that is, which is really and truly good, and which will be acknowledged as such by all truly wise and good men. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 In the way of believing obedience to God's commandments health and peace may commonly be enjoyed; and though our days may not be long upon earth, we shall live for ever in heaven.

Those who know themselves, find their own understandings a broken reed, which, if they lean upon, will fail. Do not design any thing but what is lawful, and beg God to direct thee in every case, though it may seem quite plain. In all our ways that prove pleasant, in which we gain our point, we must acknowledge God with thankfulness.

To all intents and purposes this is a continuation of the discourse in the preceding chapter, for inasmuch as that described the benefits, spiritual and moral, which follow from the pursuit of Wisdom, in promoting godliness and providing safety from evil companions, so this in like manner depicts the gain flowing from Wisdom, the happiness of the man who finds Wisdom, and the favour which he meets with both with God and man. The discourse embraces exhortations to obedience (vers. 1-4), to reliance on God (vers. 5, 6) against self-sufficiency and self-dependence (vers. 7, 8), to self-sacrificing devotion to God (vers. 9, 10), to patient submission to God's afflictive dispensations (vers. 11, 12), and concludes with pointing out the happy gain of Wisdom, her incomparable value, and wherein that value consists (vers. 13-18). It is noticeable that in each case the exhortation is accompanied with a corresponding promise  of reward (vers, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), and these promises are brought forward with the view to encourage the observance of the duties recommended or enjoined. Jehovah is the central point to which all the exhortations converge. Obedience, trust, self-sacrificing devotion, submission, are successively brought forward by the teacher as due to God, and the persons in whom they are exhibited are truly happy in finding Wisdom. The transition in thought from the former to the latter part of the discourse is easy and natural. Obedience and trust are represented as bringing favour, guidance, and health - in a word, prosperity. But God is not only to be honoured in times of prosperity, but also in adversity his loving hand is to be recognized; and in this submission to his will is true wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My son</span> (<span class="accented">b'ni</span>) serves to externally connect this discourse with the preceding. <span class="cmt_word">Forget not my law.</span> This admonition bears a strong resemblance to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, though the terms employed are somewhat different, <span class="accented">torah</span> and <span class="accented">mits'oth</span> here occupying the place respectively of <span class="accented">musar</span> and <span class="accented">torah</span> in that passage. <span class="accented">My law</span> (<span class="accented">torathi</span>), is literally, <span class="accented">my teaching</span>, or <span class="accented">doctrine</span>, from the root <span class="accented">yarah</span>, "to teach." The <span class="accented">torah</span> is the whole body of salutary doctrine, and designates "Law" from the standpoint of teaching. Forgetting here is not So much oblivion arising from defective memory, as a wilful disregard and neglect of the admonitions of the teacher. <span class="cmt_word">Thine heart</span> (<span class="accented">libekha</span>); Vulgate<span class="accented">, cor</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and so the sum total of the affections. <span class="cmt_word">Keep</span>; <span class="accented">yitstsor</span>, from <span class="accented">notsar</span>, "to keep, or observe that which is commanded."

The Hebrew verb from which it is derived means "to command, or prescribe." The law and commandments here alluded to are those which immediately follow, from ver. 3 onwards. The three main ideas combined in this verse are remembrance, affection, and obedience. Remembering the law or teaching will depend, to a large extent, on the interest felt in that law; and the admonition to "forget not" is an admonition to give "earnest heed," so that the law or teaching may be firmly fixed in the mind. In using the words, "let thy heart keep," the teacher goes to the root of the matter. There may be an historical remembrance of, or an intellectual assent to, the commandments, but these are insufficient, for the keeping of the commandments must be based on the recognition of the fact that the affections of the heart are to be employed in the service of God, the keeping of the commandments is to be a labour of love. Again, the expression, "keep my commandments," implies, of course, external conformity to their requirements: we are "to observe to do them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-1.htm">Deuteronomy 8:1</a>); but it implies, further, spiritual obedience, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an obedience with which love is combined (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-20.htm">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>), and which arises from the inward principles of the heart being in harmony with the spirit of the commandments (see Wardlaw). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>17 Who forsakes the companion of her youth,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And forgets the covenant of her God;<p>18 For she sinks down to death together with her house,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to the shadow of Hades her paths - <p>19 All they who go to her return not again,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And reach not the paths of life<p>&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, as here used, has nothing to do with the phylarch-name, similar in sound, which is a denom. of &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;; but it comes immediately from &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, to accustom oneself to a person or cause, to be familiar therewith (while the Aram. &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, &#1497;&#1500;&#1507;, to learn, Pa. to teach), and thus means, as the synon. of &#1512;&#1506;, the companion or familiar associate (vid., Schultens).

The accentuation marks &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; as the subject, but &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is elsewhere always masc., and does not, like the rarer &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>, admit in usage a double gender; also, if the fem. usage were here introduced (Bertheau, Hitzig), then the predicate, even though &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; were regarded as fem., might be, in conformity with rule, &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-17.htm">Isaiah 2:17</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492; is, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/44-26.htm">Psalm 44:26</a>, 3rd pr. of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, Arab. sa&#770;kh, to go down, to sink; the emendation &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492; (Joseph Kimchi) does not recommend itself on this account, that &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1495; mean, according to usage, to stoop or to bend down; and to interpret (Ralbag, &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;) &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492; transitively is inadmissible. For that reason Aben Ezra interprets &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; as in apposition: to death, to its house; but then the poet in that case should say &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, for death is not a house. On the other hand, we cannot perceive in &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; an accus. of the nearer definition (J. H. Michaelis, Fl.); the expression would here, as 15a, be refined without purpose. Bttcher has recognised &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; as permutative, the personal subject: for she sinks down to death, her house, i.e., she herself, together with all that belongs to her; cf. the permutative of the subject, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a> (vid., comm. l.c.), and the more particularly statement of the object, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/2-6.htm">Exodus 2:6</a>, etc. Regarding &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, shadows of the under-world (from &#1512;&#1508;&#1492;, synon. &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, weakened, or to become powerless), a word common to the Solomonic writings, vid., Comment. on Isaiah, p. 206. What <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a> says of the person of the adulteress, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-19.htm">Proverbs 2:19</a> says of those who live with her &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, her house-companions. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;, "those entering in to her," is equivalent to &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;; the participle of verbs eundi et veniendi takes the accusative object of the finite as gen. in st. constr., as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-18.htm">Genesis 23:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-10.htm">Genesis 9:10</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-20.htm">Jeremiah 10:20</a>). The &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;, with the tone on the ult., is a protestation: there is no return for those who practise fornication,<p>(Note: One is here reminded of the expression in the Aeneid, vi. 127-129:<p>Revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras,<p>Hoc opes, hoc labor est.<p>See also an impure but dreadful Talmudic story about a dissolute Rabbi, b. Aboda zara, 17a.)<p>and they do not reach the paths of life from which they have so widely strayed.<p>(Note: In correct texts &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1497;&#1490;&#1493; has the Makkeph. Vid., Torath Emeth, p. 41; Accentuationssystem, xx. 2.) </body></html>
