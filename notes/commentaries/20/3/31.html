It will be found there is little got by striving. Let us not envy prosperous oppressors; far be it from the disciples of Christ to choose any of their ways.

Similar examples are <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-13.htm">Genesis 33:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-31.htm">1 Samuel 25:31</a>, cf.

Schultens rightly says: Subest species prohibitionis et tanquam abominationis, ne tale quicquam vel in suspicionem veniat in mentemve cogitando admittatur. &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1491; here means terror, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26</a>., the terrific object; &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1501; (with the accus. om) is the virtual genitive, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-2.htm">Proverbs 26:2</a> &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1501; (with accus. am). Regarding &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;, see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>. The genitive &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; may be, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-18.htm">Psalm 37:18</a>, the genit. subjecti, but still it lies nearer to say that he who chooses the wisdom of God as his guiding star has no ground to fear punishment as transgressors have reason to fear it; the &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492; is meant which wisdom threatens against transgressors, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>. He needs have no fear of it, for wisdom is a gift of God, and binds him who receives it to the giver: Jahve becomes and is henceforth his confidence. Regarding &#1489; essentiae, which expresses the closest connection of the subject with the predicate which it introduces, see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-2.htm">Psalm 35:2</a>. As here, so also at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-4.htm">Exodus 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-7.htm">Psalm 118:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a>, the predicate is a noun with a pronominal suffix. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500; is, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-7.htm">Psalm 78:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-24.htm">Job 31:24</a>, cognate to &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1492; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492;,<p>(Note: According to Malbim, &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; is the expectation of good, and &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;, confidence in the presence of evil.)<p>the object and ground of confidence. That the word in other connections may mean also fool-hardiness, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14</a>, and folly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a> (cf. regarding &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, which in Arab. as bel&#305;&#770;d denotes the dull, in Hebr. fools, see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>), it follows that it proceeds from the fundamental conception of fulness of flesh and of fat, whence arise the conceptions of dulness and slothfulness, as well as of confidence, whether confidence in self or in God (see Schultens l.c., and Wnsche's Hosea, p. 207f.). &#1500;&#1499;&#1491; is taking, catching, as in a net or trap or pit, from &#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, to catch (cf. Arab. lakida, to fasten, III, IV to hold fast); another root-meaning, in which Arab. lak connects itself with nak, nk, to strike, to assail (whence al-lakdat, the assault against the enemy, Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitsch. xxii. 140), is foreign to the Hebr. Regarding the &#1502;&#1503; of &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1491;, Fleischer remarks: "The &#1502;&#1503; after the verbs of guarding, preserving, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; and &#1504;&#1510;&#1512;, properly expresses that one by those means holds or seeks to hold a person or thing back from something, like the Lat. defendere, tueri aliquem ab hostibus, a perculo."<p>(Note: Hitzig rejects <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-22.htm">Proverbs 3:22-26</a> as a later interpolation. And why? Because chap. 3, which he regards as a complete discourse, consists of twice ten verses beginning with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;. In addition to this symmetry other reasons easily reveal themselves to his penetration. But the discourses contained in chap. 1-9 do not all begin with &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>); and when it stands in the beginning of the discourse, it is not always the first word (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>); and when it occurs as the first word or in the first line, it does not always commence a new discourse (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-15.htm">Proverbs 1:15</a> in the middle of the first, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11</a> in the middle of the fourth); and, moreover, the Hebr. poetry and oratory does not reckon according to verses terminated by Soph Pasuk, which are always accented distichs, but they in reality frequently consist of three or more lines. The rejected verses are in nothing unlike those that remain, and which are undisputed; they show the same structure of stichs, consisting for the most part of three, but sometimes also only of two words (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-22.htm">Proverbs 3:22</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>), the same breadth in the course of the thoughts, and the same accord with Job and Deuteronomy.) </body></html>
