The prudence and sobriety which religion teaches, tend not only to the health of the soul, but to the health of the body. Worldly wealth is but poor substance, yet, such as it is, we must honour God with it; and those that do good with what they have, shall have more to do more good with. Should the Lord visit us with trials and sickness, let us not forget that the exhortation speaks to us as to children, for our good. We must not faint under an affliction, be it ever so heavy and long, not be driven to despair, or use wrong means for relief. The father corrects the son whom he loves, because he loves him, and desires that he may be wise and good. Afflictions are so far from doing God's children any hurt, that, by the grace of God, they promote their holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Substance" points to capital, "increase" to revenue.

Or, "out of thy substance" (n); for as it should be a man's own that he gives, and not another's, and therefore called "thy substance"; or, as the Septuagint version, "out of thy just labours", what is righteously and lawfully gotten, and not by fraud and oppression; so it is only a part of it, and not all, that is required; what in proportion to his substance can be prudently spared, and is sufficient and suitable to the call in Providence. A man's "substance" are his wealth and riches; his "mammon", as the Targum; which, in comparison of heavenly things, indeed have no substance in them: yet these are worldly substance, and of account; and as with these God has honoured men, they should honour him with them again, by giving to the poor, especially his poor saints; for as an oppressing of them is a reproaching of him, so having mercy on them is honouring him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>; and especially by contributing to the support of his worship, the keeping up the interest and credit of religion, and for the spread of the Gospel; and chiefly by communicating to the ministers of it, giving them the "double honour" which is due to them, and which, when given them, the Lord takes as done to himself, as an honouring him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>; <p>and with the firstfruits of all thine increase; or, "out of the chief of all thine increase" (o); God must have the best, and in the first place. The allusion is either to the maintenance of the priests and Levites under the law, and the manner of doing it; which, among other things, was out of the annual produce of the earth, and the firstfruits of it; and may respect the comfortable support of Gospel ministers under the present dispensation; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13</a>; or to the firstfruits of every kind offered to the Lord, and to the feast kept sacred to him at the ingathering the fruits of the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10</a>; and even among the Heathens formerly were something of the same kind.

The insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> by the LXX. limits the wealth to that which is justly acquired, and so guards against the erroneous idea that God is honoured by the appropriation to his use of unlawful wealth or gain (Plumptre). The Israelites "honoured Jehovah with their substance" when they contributed towards the erection of the tabernacle in the wilderness, and later when they assisted in the preparations for the building of the temple, and in the payment of tithes. The injunction may undoubtedly refer to tithes, and is in accordance with the requirement of the Mosaic Law on that and other points as to oblations, free will offerings, etc.; but it has a wider bearing and contemplates the use of wealth for all pious and charitable purposes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>). The word <span class="accented">maaser</span>, "tithe," does not occur in the Proverbs. <span class="cmt_word">With the firstfruits</span> (<span class="accented">mere-shith</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">de primitiis.</span> So Targum Jonathan, Syriac, and Arabic.

The firstfruits were presented by every Israelite to the priests, in token of gratitude and humble thankfulness to Jehovah, and consisted of the produce of the land in its natural state, or prepared for human food (Maclear, 'Old Test. Hist.,' bk. 4, c. 3, <span class="accented">a</span>). The "firstfruits" also carried with it the idea of the best. The custom of offering the firstfruits of the field and other revenues as a religious obligation was observed by ancient pagan nations (see Diod. Sic., 1:14; Plut., 'De Iside,' p. 377; Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 18:2 (Zockler). Some of the ancient commentators find in this verse an argument for the support of the ministry. It is well known that the priests "lived of the sacrifice," and were "partakers of the altar," and as their support by these means tended to the maintenance of Divine worship, so those who supported them were in the highest degree "honoring God." The injunctions also show that the honouring of God does not consist simply of lip service, of humility and confidence in him, but also of external worship, and in corporeal things. They are not peculiar to Israel, but are binding on all. They oppose all <span class="accented">selfish</span> use of God's temporal gifts, and lead to the thought that, in obeying them, we are only giving back to God what are his own. "The silver and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts" (Haggai 2:28). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"We give thee but thine own,<br />Whate'er the gift may be;<br />All that we have is thine shine,<br />A trust, O Lord, from thee."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Day's 'Psalter.'</span>) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With this verse the doctrine begins; &#1488;&#1500; (not &#1500;&#1488;) shows the 3a does not continue the promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a>. &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (R. &#1495;&#1501;, stringere, afficere) is, according to the prevailing usage of the language, well-affectedness, it may be of God toward men, or of men toward God, or of men toward one another - a loving disposition, of the same meaning as the N.T. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; (vid., e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>). &#1488;&#1502;&#1514; (from &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;), continuance, a standing to one's promises, and not falsifying just expectations; thus fidelity, &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, in the interrelated sense of fides and fidelitas. These two states of mind and of conduct are here contemplated as moral powers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>), which are of excellent service, and bring precious gain; and 4b shows that their ramification on the side of God and of men, the religious and the moral, remains radically inseparable. The suffix  &#1501; does not refer to the doctrine and the precepts, but to these two cardinal virtues. If the disciple is admonished to bind them about his neck (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-22.htm">Proverbs 3:22</a>), so here reference is made, not to ornament, nor yet to protection against evil influences by means of them, as by an amulet<p>(Note: Fleischer is here reminded of the giraffe in the Jardin des Plantes, the head of which was adorned by its Arabic keeper with strings and jewels, the object of which was to turn aside the &#8219;ain [the bad, mischievous look] from the precious beast.)<p>(for which proofs are wanting), but to the signet which was wont to be constantly carried (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/38-18.htm">Genesis 38:18</a>, cf. Sol 8:6) on a string around the neck. The parallel member 3c confirms this; 3b and 3c together put us in mind of the Tephillim (phylacteries), <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-16.htm">Exodus 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>, in which what is here a figure is presented in external form, but as the real figure of that which is required in the inward parts. &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; (from &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, Arab. l'ah, to begin to shine, e.g., of a shooting star, gleaming sword; vid., Wetzstein, Deutsch. morgenl. Zeitschr. xxii. 151f.) signifies the tablet prepared for writing by means of polish; to write love and fidelity on the tablet of the heart, is to impress deeply on the heart the duty of both virtues, so that one will be impelled to them from within outward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). </body></html>
