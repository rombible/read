We must make wisdom our business; we must venture all in it, and be willing to part with all for it. This Wisdom is the Lord Jesus Christ and his salvation, sought and obtained by faith and prayer. Were it not for unbelief, remaining sinfulness, and carelessness, we should find all our ways pleasantness, and our paths peace, for his are so; but we too often step aside from them, to our own hurt and grief. Christ is that Wisdom, by whom the worlds were made, and still are in being; happy are those to whom he is made of God wisdom. He has wherewithal to make good all his promises.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4</a>.

The believer is a spiritual merchant; faith is a trading with and for Christ, and for spiritual and heavenly things by him; and because there is a parting with something for Christ, as a man's sinful lusts and pleasures, his own righteousness, his friends and relations, when set in opposition to or competition with him, and even life itself, when called for; and because he runs a risk of suffering reproach, afflictions, and death itself; therefore this concern with him, and enjoyment of him, is called a "merchandise", which is "better than that of silver", or than silver which is got by merchandise: for Christ, and the things of Christ, are more valuable than silver, and to be preferred unto it; more useful and profitable than silver is, which a man may have a large abundance of, and lose his soul, whereas by Christ is the salvation of it; more satisfying than silver is, with which a man is never satisfied, whereas he that has Christ has enough, having all things; more pleasant in obtaining, and more safe in enjoying; a great deal of anxiety and vexation attend the one, and inexpressible pleasure the other; and more durable and lasting than that, the enjoyment of Christ is for ever; <p>and the gain thereof than fine gold; the doctrines and ordinances of Christ are more to be desired than gold, yea, than fine gold; the blessings of grace by Christ, such as redemption, pardon of sin, &amp;c. are not obtained by corruptible things, as silver and gold, but are more precious than they; and even the graces of Christ in the hearts of his people, as faith, hope, and love, are more precious than gold that perisheth; and much more preferable must he himself be, and the gain that accrues to a believer by him, which is cent per cent an hundred fold, even in this world, and in the world to come everlasting life: it is all clear gain a believer gets by Christ and trading with him; he has him, and all with him, without money and without price; he has that which is more worth than the gain of the whole world, even the salvation of his immortal soul; the riches he has by Christ are immense and unsearchable, the riches of grace and glory; it cannot be said how great this gain is. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">the merchandise of it</span>] Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/13-45.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:...">Matthew 13:45-46</a>, where this proverb is expanded into a parable.

The gain arising from trading in wisdom is better than that which arises from trading in silver. <span class="accented">Sakh'rah</span> is the gain or profit arising from merchandise, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from trading. It denotes the act itself of gaining. The root <span class="accented">sakrah</span>, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, signifies "to go about for the sake of traffic," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to trade. There may be an allusion here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4</a>, to the new commerce (Plumptre). <span class="cmt_word">The gain thereof</span> (<span class="accented">t'vuathah</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gain existing in, and going along with, Wisdom herself; gain, therefore, in a different sense from that indicated in <span class="accented">sakh'rah.</span> Gesenius takes it as "gain resulting from Wisdom," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-19.htm">Proverbs 8:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>. The word is used of the produce of the earth, the idea apparently embodied in the Vulgate <span class="accented">fructus.</span> In this case there may be a reference to ver. 18, where Wisdom is said to be a "tree of life." The LXX. omits the latter clause of this verse. The sense is, "The possession of Wisdom herself is better than fine gold." <span class="cmt_word">Fine gold</span> (<span class="accented">karuts</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">aurum purum</span>; Syriac, <span class="accented">aurum purissimum. Kharuts</span> is the poetic word for gold, so called, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from its brilliancy, and then akin to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (Curtius); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from its being dug up, from the root <span class="accented">kharats</span>, "to cut into or dig up, to sharpen." It evidently means the finest and purest gold, and is here contrasted with silver (<span class="accented">keseph</span>). The word is translated "choice gold" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>; "gold" simply in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>; "yellow gold" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-13.htm">Psalm 68:13</a>; and "fine gold" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>. In the Version Junii et Tremellii it appears as <span class="accented">effosum aurum</span>, "gold dug up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> gold in its native, unalloyed state. The Targum Jonathan understands it of "molten gold" (<span class="accented">aurum conflatum</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The subject to &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;; (it shall be) is just this religious-moral conduct.
