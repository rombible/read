Let not mercy and truth forsake thee; God's mercy in promising, and his truth in performing: live up to them, keep up thine interest in them, and take the comfort of them. We must trust in the Lord with all our hearts, believing he is able and wise to do what is best. Those who know themselves, find their own understandings a broken reed, which, if they lean upon, will fail. Do not design any thing but what is lawful, and beg God to direct thee in every case, though it may seem quite plain. In all our ways that prove pleasant, in which we gain our point, we must acknowledge God with thankfulness. In all our ways that prove uncomfortable, and that are hedged up with thorns, we must acknowledge him with submission. It is promised, He shall direct thy paths; so that thy way shall be safe and good, and happy at last.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not in acts of solemn worship or great crises only, but "in all thy ways;" and then God will make the "path" straight and even. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. ways&#8212;(Ps 1:1).<p>acknowledge&#8212;by seeking His wise aid (Pr 16:3; Ps 37:5; Jer 9:23, 24).<p>direct&#8212;literally, "make plain" (compare Heb 12:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ways; </span> designs and undertakings for the things of this life or of the next. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Acknowledge him, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">know him</span>, to wit, practically; or, <span class="ital">own him</span>; his wisdom, in following his counsels; his power and goodness, in expecting success from him; his sovereignty, in managing all thy affairs so as to please and glorify him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Direct thy paths; </span> assist and bless all thine endeavours, and keep thee from the paths of sin and destruction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In all thy ways acknowledge him,....

The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">yada</span> signifies "to know, recognize." To acknowledge God is, therefore, to recognize, in all our dealings and undertakings, God's overruling providence, which "shapes our ends, rough hew them as we will." It is not a mere theoretical acknowledgment, but one that engages the whole energies of the soul (Delitzsch), and sees in God power, wisdom, providence, goodness, and justice. This meaning is conveyed by the Vulgate <span class="accented">cogitare</span>, which is "to consider" in all parts, "to reflect upon." David's advice to his son Solomon is, "Know thou (<span class="accented">ola</span>) the God of thy father." We may well acknowledge Jehovah; for he "knoweth the way of the righteous" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>). Acknowledging God also implies that we first ascertain whether what we are about to take in hand is in accordance with his precepts, and then look for his direction and illumination (Wardlaw). <span class="cmt_word">And he shall direct thy paths</span> (<span class="accented">v'hu y'yashsher or'khotheyka</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he himself shall make them straight, or level, removing all obstacles out of the way; or they shall, under God's direction, prosper and come to a successful issue; they shall be virtuous, inasmuch as deviation into vice will be guarded against, and happy, because they are prosperous. The pronoun <span class="accented">v'hu</span> is emphatic, "he himself;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">et ipse. Yashar</span>, piel. is "to make a way straight," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-21.htm">Proverbs 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>. Cf. the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "to cut straight" (see on Proverbs 11:5). God here binds himself by a covenant (Lapide). This power is properly attributed to God, for "it is not in man to direct his steps" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; there commences a new section, coordinating itself with the &#1500;&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498; ("to deliver thee") of <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-12.htm">Proverbs 2:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>, unfolding that which wisdom accomplishes as a preserver and guide:<p>20 So that thou walkest in the good way,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And keepest the right paths.<p>21 For the upright shall inhabit the land,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the innocent shall remain in it.<p>22 But the godless are cut off out the land,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the faithless are rooted out of it.<p>Wisdom - thus the connection - will keep thee, so that thou shalt not fall under the seductions of man or of woman; keep, in order that thou... &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; (from &#1502;&#1506;&#1503;  equals  &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, tendency, purpose) refers to the intention and object of the protecting wisdom. To the two negative designations of design there follows, as the third and last, a positive one. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (contrast to &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-19.htm">Proverbs 14:19</a>) is here used in a general ethical sense: the good (Guten, not Gtigen, the kind). &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, with the object of the way, may in another connection also mean to keep oneself from, cavere ab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-4.htm">Psalm 17:4</a>); here it means: carefully to keep in it. The promise of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-21.htm">Proverbs 2:21</a> is the same as in the Mashal <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-11.htm">Psalm 37:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-22.htm">Psalm 37:22</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-30.htm">Proverbs 10:30</a>. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is Canaan, or the land which God promised to the patriarchs, and in which He planted Israel, whom He had brought out of Egypt; not the earth, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, according to the extended, unlimited N.T. circle of vision. &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; (Milel) is erroneously explained by Schultens: funiculis bene firmis irroborabunt in terra. The verb &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, Arab. watar, signifies to yoke (whence &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, a cord, rope), then intrans. to be stretched out in length, to be hanging over (vid., Fleischer on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-11.htm">Job 30:11</a>); whence &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, residue, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>, and after which the lxx here renders &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and Jerome permanebunt. In 22b the old translators render &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; as the fut. of the pass. &#1504;&#1505;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>; but in this case it would be &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1505;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;.

Niph. &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468; is, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-25.htm">Proverbs 15:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>, active: evellant; and this, with the subj. remaining indefinite (for which J. H. Michaelis refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-9.htm">Hosea 12:9</a>), is equivalent to evellentur. This indefinite "they" or "one" ("man"), Fleischer remarks, can even be used of God, as here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a> - a thing which is common in Persian, where e.g., the expression rendered hominem ex pulvere fecerunt is used instead of the fuller form, which would be rendered homo a Deo ex pulvere factus est. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; bears (as &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491; proves) the primary meaning of concealed, i.e., malicious (treacherous and rapacious, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>), and then faithless men.<p>(Note: Similar is the relation in Arab. of labbasa to liba&#770;s (&#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;); it means to make a thing unknown by covering it; whence telb&#305;&#770;s, deceit, mulebbis, a falsifier.) </body></html>
