When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Another picture of the results of living in the fear of the Lord.

Either Christ, the Wisdom of God; who enters there at conversion, and sets up a throne in the heart, and dwells there by faith: or else the Gospel, the wisdom of God in a mystery; which enters not into the head only, as in hypocrites and formal professors; nor into the natural affections, as in the stony ground hearers; but into the heart, opened by the Spirit of God to receive it, so as to have a spiritual understanding of it; which is done when the Gospel comes not in word only, but in the demonstration and power of the Spirit; when a man truly understands it, approves of it, loves it, believes it; and it has a place in his heart, and richly dwells there; <p>and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; which the Gospel thus entering gives; even the knowledge of God in Christ, as the God of all grace, as gracious and merciful, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin; the knowledge of Christ, as the only Redeemer and Saviour; and the knowledge of Gospel truths, which lead and relate unto him: all which is pleasant to a gracious soul, and affords unspeakable delight to the mind; and is sweeter, as every truth of the Gospel is, than the honey or the honeycomb; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">When wisdom entereth … knowledge is pleasant</span>] Rather: <span class="bld">For wisdom shall enter … knowledge shall be pleasant</span>, R.V.

The conditional force is adopted by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> and the Vulgate <span class="accented">si.</span> In the previous section of this address, the teacher has shown that the search after Wisdom will result in possession.; now he points out, when Wisdom is secured, certain advantageous consequences follow. The transition is easy and natural. The form of construction is very similar to that adopted previously. There is first the hypothesis, if we give this force to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, though much shorter; and secondly the climax, also shorter and branching off into the statement of two special cases. <span class="accented">Entereth</span>; or, <span class="accented">shall enter</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span> <span class="accented">thavo</span>) in the sense of permanent residence in the heart. Wisdom is not only to come in, but to rest there (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33</a>). The expression is illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>. The imagery of the verse is taken from the reception and entertainment of a guest. As we receive a welcome guest, and find pleasure in his company, so is Wisdom to be dear to the heart and soul. <span class="accented">Into thine heart</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>, <span class="accented">b'libecha</span>). The heart (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>) "concentrates in it. self the personal life of man in all its relations, the conscious and the unconscious, the voluntary and the involuntary, the physical and the spiritual impulses, the emotions and states" (Cremer, 'Bib. Theol. Lex.,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). It is that in which the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">nephesh</span>),"soul," manifests itself. It is the centre of the life of will and desire, of the emotions, and of the moral life. Rudloff ('Lehre von Menscher,' p. 59, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, apud Zockler) remarks that everywhere in the Scriptures the heart appears to belong more to the life of desire and feeling than to the intellectual activity of the soul. But at the same time, it is to be noted that intelligent conception is attributed to the heart (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-10.htm">Proverbs 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-5.htm">Proverbs 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>. The expression seems to be put  here for the moral side of man's nature; and in the Hellenistic sense, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the proper equivalent of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> "heart," involves all that stands for <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it includes, besides other things, the intellectual faculty. The word "soul" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">nephesh</span>) is here found in combination with "heart." The other passages where they are mentioned together are <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-2.htm">Psalm 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>. The soul is primarily the vital principle, but according to the <span class="accented">usus loquendi</span> of Holy Scripture, it frequently denotes the entire inward nature of man; it is that part which is the object of the work of redemption. The homo of the soul is the heart, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-10.htm">Proverbs 14:10</a>, "The heart knoweth his own bitterness [or, 'the bitterness of his soul,' Hebrew]." While the "heart" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>) is rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>, the only Greek equivalent to "soul" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) is <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span>. The two expressions, "heart," and "soul," in the passage before us may be taken as designating both the moral and spiritual sides of man's nature. Wisdom is to be acceptable and pleasant to man in these respects. It may be remarked that an intellectual colouring is given to the word "heart" by the LXX., who render it by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> and other passages, evidently from the idea that prominence is given to the reflective faculty. Classically, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> equivalent to "thought," "faculty of thought," "intellect." <span class="cmt_word">Knowledge</span> (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">to know</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a> and Proverbs 14:6; here used synonymously with "wisdom." Knowledge, not merely as cognition, but perception; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not merely knowing a thing with respect to its existence and being, but as to its excellence and truth. Equivalent to the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "perception," and the Vulgate <span class="accented">scientia. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Is pleasant</span> (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">yin'am</span>); literally, <span class="accented">shall be pleasant</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sweet, lovely, beautiful. The same word is used impersonally in Jacob's blessing of Issachar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-15.htm">Genesis 49:15</a>, "And he saw the land that it was pleasant"), and also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-25.htm">Proverbs 24:25</a>, "To those that punish [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the judges] there shall be delight." And this usage has led Dunn to take knowledge as an accusative of reference, and to translate, "There is pleasure to thy soul in respect of knowledge;" but the Authorized Version may be accepted as correct. "Knowledge" is masculine, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a> and Proverbs 14:6, and agrees with the masculine verb "is pleasant." Knowledge will be pleasant from the enjoyment and rest which it yields. The Arabic presents the idea of this enjoyment under a different aspect: "And prudence shall be in thy soul the most beautiful glory." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; there is an old &#1488;&#1500; &#1514;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;<p>(Note: Regarding this formula, see Strack's Prolegomena, pp. 66-70.)<p>(read not so, but thus), &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; (if thou callest understanding mother), which supposes the phrase &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; (lxx) as traditional.

He who strives after wisdom earnestly and really, reaches in this way fellowship with God; for just as He gives wisdom, it is nowhere else than with Him, and it never comes from any other source than from Him.

The objection of J. D. Michaelis, Supplem. p. 1167, Non placent in linguis ejusmodi etyma metaphysica, etc., does not apply here, since the word is a new one coined by the Chokma, but all the shades of meaning are naturally derived from the fundamental signification "furtherance" (cf. Seneca, Deus stator stabilitorque est). "&#1514;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;, from Arab. a&#770;sy and wasy, to further by word and deed, to assist by counsel and act, to render help, whence the meanings auxilium, salus, and prudens consilium, sapientia, easily follow; cf.

Zeitschr. xxii. 19), but the roots &#1493;&#1513; and &#1513;&#1493; are different; &#1493;&#1513; and &#1488;&#1513;, on the contrary, are modifications of one root.)<p>In the passage under consideration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>), &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; signifies advancement in the sense of true prosperity. The parallel passage 7a clothes itself in the form of an apposition: (He) a shield (&#1502;&#1490;&#1503;, n. instr. of &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1503;, to cover) for &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497; &#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, pilgrims of innocence (Fl.), i.e., such as walk in the way (the object-accus., as <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12</a>, for which in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a> &#1489;&#1468;) of innocence. &#1514;&#1468;&#1501; is whole, full submission, moral faultlessness, which chooses God with the whole heart, seeks good without exception: a similar thought is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-12.htm">Psalm 84:12</a>. &#1500;&#1504;&#1510;&#1512;, 8a, is such an inf. of consequence as &#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a>), and here, as there, is continued in the finite. The "paths of justice" are understood with reference to those who enter them and keep in them; parallel, "the way of His saints" (&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;, he who cherishes &#1495;&#1505;&#1491;, earnest inward love to God), for that is just &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1470;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a>): they are &#1492;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>). Instead of the Mugrash, the conjunctive Tarcha is to be given to &#1493;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;. </body></html>
