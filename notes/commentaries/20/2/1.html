These are either the continuation of the words of Solomon to his son Rehoboam; or to anyone that came to him for instruction, or was within the reach of being taught by him; whom he addresses in this tender and affectionate manner, in order to gain his attention to what he was about to say: or else they are the words of Wisdom, or Christ, continued, thus bespeaking: his children and people; and giving them some very wholesome counsel and advice, backed with the most powerful and prevailing arguments; <p>if thou wilt receive my words; or doctrines: the doctrines of the Gospel, relating to the person, office, and grace of Christ, and salvation by him; such as the words of peace, pardon, righteousness, and life; which are to be received, not as the word of man, but as the word of God; and with all readiness of mind and willingness, as they were by the Bereans; and most gladly, as by the three thousand pricked to the heart under Peter's sermon; and as they are and will be by every sensible sinner; <p>and hide my commandments with thee; in the heart; so as to have a high esteem of them, and a hearty affection and value for them; retain them in memory, and frequently think of them and meditate upon them, and constantly observe them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> hide my commandments with thee;</span><p>(a) That is, keep them in your heart.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">hide</span>] or, <span class="ital">lay up</span>, R.V.; as a treasure stored carefully.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-22.</span> - 3. <span class="accented">Third admonitory discourse, pointing out the benefits which arise from a sincere, earnest, and persevering search after Wisdom.</span> This discourse divides itself into three parts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Vers. 1-9: a statement of the conditions which, if fulfilled, result in the highest knowledge of Jehovah - the fear of Jehovah and the knowledge of God, who is the Source of wisdom and the Protection and Ensurer of safety to the righteous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Vers. 10-19: the negatively beneficial results of Wisdom, in delivery from the paths of evil, from destructive lusts and passions, from the temptations of wicked men and wicked women. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Vers. 20-22: the epilogue, or conclusion, combining encouragement on the one hand, and warning on the other. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The teacher here reverts to the original form of his address, as appears from the employment of the term, <span class="cmt_word">my son</span>. It seems clear that it is no longer Wisdom personified who is the speaker, from the fact that the words, "wisdom and understanding" in ver. 2 are used without the possessive pronoun "my," which would have been undoubtedly inserted if this address had been a continuation of the discourse in the preceding chapter. Some of the ideas of that address, however, are restated, as the crying and lifting up the voice after Wisdom, and the  conclusion, wherein the respective destinies of the pious and wicked are portrayed. The particle "if" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>) is conditional, and serves to introduce the series of clauses (vers. 1-4) which lay down the conditions upon which the promises depend, and which form the protasis to the double apodosis in vers. 5 and 9. De Wette, Meyer, and Delitzsch regard it as voluntative, as expressing a wish on the part of the teacher, and translate, "Oh that thou wouldst!" and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, "if," is used in this way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-19.htm">Psalm 139:19</a>; but the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>) and Vulgate (<span class="accented">si</span>) make it conditional. It is repeated in an emphatic form in ver. 3. <span class="cmt_word">Receive</span>. The verbs "receive" and "hide" show that the endeavour after Wisdom is to be candid and sincere. "To receive" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) seems to be here used, like the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the sense of "to receive graciously," "to admit the words of Wisdom." It is noticeable that there is a gradation in emphasis in the various terms here used by the teacher. Just as "commandments" is stronger than "words," so "hide" is stronger than "receive." The emphasizing is carried on in the following verses in the same way, and at length culminates in ver. 4, which sums up the ardent spirit in which the search after Wisdom is to be prosecuted in presenting it to us in its strongest form. <span class="cmt_word">Hide</span>. The original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">tsaphan</span>) is here used in a different sense to that in which it occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a> and 18. It here refers, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-14.htm">Proverbs 10:14</a>; and Proverbs 13:22, to the storing or laying up, as of treasure, in some secret repository, and means "to lay up." The Divine commands of the teacher are to be hidden in safe custody in the memory, in the understanding, in the conscience, and in the heart (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-21.htm">Proverbs 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-1.htm">Proverbs 7:1</a>). The psalmist expresses the same idea in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, "Thy words have I <span class="accented">hid</span> in my heart, that I might not sin against thee." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then - this sublime preacher in the streets continues - distress shall teach them to pray:<p>28 Then shall they call on me, and I will not answer;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall early seek after me, and not find me;<p>29 Because that they hated knowledge,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did not choose the fear of Jahve.<p>30 They have not yielded to my counsel,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despised all my reproof:<p>31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And satiate themselves with their own counsels.<p>In the full emphatic forms, &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, they shall call on me, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, they shall seek me, and &#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, they shall find me, the suffix &#1504;&#1497; may be joined to the old plur. ending u&#770;n (Gesenius, Olshausen, Bttcher); but open forms like &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, He will bless him,&#1497;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, He will honour me (from &#1497;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;), and the like, rather favour the conclusion that &#1504; is epenthetic (Ew. 250, b).<p>(Note: In the Codd. &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; is written; in this case the Metheg indicates the tone syllable: vid., Torath Emeth, p. 7 note, p. 21 note; and Accentssystem, ii. 1, note.

Each one eats of the fruit of his way - good fruit of good ways (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-10.htm">Isaiah 3:10</a>), and evil fruit of evil ways. "The &#1502;&#1503;, 31b, introduces the object from which, as a whole, that which one eats, and with which he is satisfied, is taken as a part, or the object from which, as from a fountain, satisfaction flows forth" (Fl.). In correct texts, &#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; has the accent Dech, and at the same time Munach as its servant.
