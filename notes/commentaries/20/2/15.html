When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The evil-doers here include not robbers and murderers only <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-16</a>, but all who leave the straight path and the open day for crooked ways, perverse counsels, deeds of darkness.

Seb. Schmid is wrong in his rendering, et omnis via qua bonum aditur erit tibi plana, which in comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-7.htm">Isaiah 26:7</a> would be feebly expressed. J. H. Michaelis rightly interprets all these four conceptions as object-accusatives; the fourth is the summarizing asyndeton (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-7.htm">Psalm 8:7</a>) breaking off the enumeration: omnem denique orbitam boni; Jerome, bonam: in this case, however, &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; would be genitive (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a>). &#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; is the way in which the chariot rolls along; in &#1506;&#1490;&#1500; there are united the root-conceptions of that which is found (&#1490;&#1500;) and rolling (&#1490;&#1500;). Whether &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>, is the argumentative "because" (according to the versions and most interpreters) or "for" ("denn," J. H. Michaelis, Ewald, and others), is a question. That with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  "for" the subject would precede the verb, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-21.htm">Proverbs 2:21</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a> (Hitzig), determines nothing, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a> shows. On the one hand, the opinion that &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  "because" is opposed by the analogy of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, following &#1488;&#1494;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5</a>; the inequality between <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5-8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>. if the new commencement, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>, at once gives place to another, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>; the relationship of the subject ideas in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a>, which makes <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a> unsuitable to be a conclusion from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>. On the contrary, the promise not only of intellectual, but at the same time also of practical, insight into the right and the good, according to their whole compass and in their manifoldness, can be established or explained quite well as we thus read <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a> : For wisdom will enter (namely, to make it a dwelling-place, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>) into thine heart, and knowledge will do good to thy soul (namely, by the enjoyment which arises from the possession of knowledge, and the rest which its certainty yields). &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, is elsewhere fem. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-6.htm">Psalm 139:6</a>), but here, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-6.htm">Proverbs 14:6</a>, in the sense of &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, is masc. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a> the contents of the &#1488;&#1494; &#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>) are further explained. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500;, of watching (for <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-16.htm">Job 16:16</a> is to be interpreted differently), is used only by our poet (here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-22.htm">Proverbs 6:22</a>). Discretion, i.e., the capacity of well-considered action, will hold watch over thee, take thee under protection; understanding, i.e., the capacity in the case of opposing rules to make the right choice, and in the matter of extremes to choose the right medium, will be bestowed upon thee. In &#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1510;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/61-8.htm">Psalm 61:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/140-2.htm">Psalm 140:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-5.htm">Psalm 140:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-9.htm">Deuteronomy 33:9</a>, etc., the first stem letter is not assimilated, in order that the word may have a fuller sound; the writing  &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; for  &#1498; is meant to affect the eye.<p>(Note: For the right succession of the accents here, see Torath Emeth, p. 49,  5; Accentuationssystem, xviii.  3.) </body></html>
