That is, the Lord keeps them; he does that which is just and right himself, in the course of his providence, and in the methods of his grace; and as he guides the feet of his people in the ways of righteousness and holiness, he keeps them there from turning out of them. The words may be rendered, "to keep the paths of judgment" (q); and so expresses the end, fruit, and effect of the Lord's being a buckler to them, as he is said to be in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>, he is their shield and protection, so as either to keep them in the right ways in which they should go; or that they might studiously observe them, and keep walking therein, without stumbling in them, or declining from them; <p>and preserveth the way of his saints; to whom he has been kind and bountiful; or who have been merciful, liberal, and generous to others; who having partook of the grace of God themselves, are useful to men: the Targum calls them "righteous ones". These the Lord preserves by his power and grace, in the way in which he has led them, and which is his own way, safe to his kingdom and glory: for none of his saints, his holy and righteous ones, shall ever perish; the way in which he directs them, and in which he keeps them, leads to everlasting life; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9</a>. <p>(q) "ad custodiendum", Pagninus, Montanus; "ad servandum", Baynus, Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>.

Some connect the Hebrew infinitive <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">lin'tsor</span>), "to watch or keep," with "them that walk uprightly," and translate, "them that walk uprightly by keeping the paths of judgment;" but this is to transfer the idea of protection from God to such persons. The verb signifies specially "to defend, to preserve from danger," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-12.htm">Proverbs 22:12</a>, "The eyes of the Lind preserve knowledge; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> defend or protect it from danger." It is God who "keepeth the paths of judgment," as he alone has the power to do so. He watches over all that walk therein, guides, superin. tends, and protects them. <span class="accented">The paths of judgment</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">justice</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">at'khoth mishpat</span>). The abstract is here used for the concrete, and the phrase means "the paths of the just," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the paths in which the just walk, or "those who walk justly"  (Mercerus). This expression corresponds with "the way of his saints," just as "keep" and "preserve" are synonymous verbs, both meaning "to guard, keep safe, or protect." <span class="cmt_word">He preserveth the way of his saints.</span> God does this <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by his preventing grace, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-9.htm">Psalm 66:9</a>, "He suffereth not our feet to slip." Cf. Hannah's song, "He will keep the feet of his saints" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by angelic agency, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, "He shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways." The saints are ever under the watchful care and mighty protection of Jehovah. <span class="accented">His saints</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> <span class="accented">khasidav</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the pious towards God, the godly, those in whose hearts the principles of sanctity have been implanted, and who cherish earnest inward love to God, and "walk righteously" and "speak uprightly" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>). It is remarkable that the word saints only occurs once (in this passage) in the Proverbs. During the period of the Maccabaean Wars, a party or sect, which aimed at ceremonial purity, claimed for themselves the title of <span class="accented">Chasidim</span> or <span class="accented">Asidaeans</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), as expressive of their piety or devotion. They are those whom Moses called "men of holiness," <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">v'an'shev-kodesh</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-5.htm">Psalm 89:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/149-1.htm">Psalm 149:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-3.htm">Deuteronomy 33:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-18.htm">Daniel 7:18, 22, 22, 25</a>.

(O si), and then as an optative, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-9.htm">Psalm 81:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-19.htm">Psalm 139:19</a>. &#1488;&#1494; ...&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-3.htm">Proverbs 2:3-5</a>, with the inserted connecting clauses, would then be confirmatory, "for then." But since this poet loves to unfold one and the same thought in ever new forms, one has perhaps to begin the conditional premisses with <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1</a>, and to regard &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; as a new commencement. Hitzig takes this &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; in the sense of imo: "much more if thou goest to meet her, e.g., by curious inquiry, not merely permittest her quietly to come to thee." &#1488;&#1501; would then preserve its conditional meaning; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-18.htm">Job 31:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a>, since it implies an intentional negative, would receive the meaning of imo. But the sentences ranged together with &#1488;&#1501; are too closely related in meaning to admit such a negative between them. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; will thus be confirmatory, not mediately, but immediately; it is the "for  equals  yes" of confirmation of the preceding conditions, and takes them up again (Ewald, 356, b, cf. 330 b) after the form of the conditional clause was given up. The &#1510;&#1508;&#1503;, which in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-11.htm">Proverbs 1:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-18.htm">Proverbs 1:18</a>, is the synonym of &#1510;&#1508;&#1492;, speculari, presents itself here, 1b, 7a, as the synonym of &#1496;&#1502;&#1503;, whence &#1502;&#1496;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, synon. of &#1510;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, recondita; the group of sounds, &#1510;&#1507;, &#1510;&#1501;, &#1496;&#1501; (cf. also &#1491;&#1507;, in Arab. dafan, whence dafynat, treasure), express shades of the root representation of pressing together. The inf. of the conclusion &#1500;&#1492;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to incline (Gr. Venet. &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;), is followed by the accus. of the object &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1498;, thine ear, for &#1492;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; properly means to stiffen (not to purge, as Schultens, nor to sharpen, as Gesenius thinks); cf. under <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-17.htm">Psalm 10:17</a>. With &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; are interchanged &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, which properly means that which is distinguished or separated, and &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, which means the distinguishing, separating, appellations of the capacity of distinguishing in definite cases and in general; but it does not represent this as a faculty of the soul, but as a divine power which communicates itself as the gift of God (charisma). </body></html>
