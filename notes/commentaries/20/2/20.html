When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The previous picture of shame and sin is brought before the disciple as an incentive to a better course. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

Who are not so by nature, but made so by the grace of God; such as the saints, prophets, and patriarchs of old; and who walked in the way of righteousness, holiness, and truth; being directed therein by the Spirit and word of God: now the use and profit of wisdom's instructions, or of the Gospel of Christ, and the doctrines of it, and a spiritual understanding of them, are not only to deliver men from the wicked man and the naughty woman, but also to influence and engage them to follow the examples of good men, and to walk in the same good old paths as they have done, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-12.htm">Hebrews 6:12</a>; <p>and keep the paths of the righteous; not only observe them and walk in them, but continue therein, even in the paths of faith and holiness; for righteous men, such as are made righteous by the righteousness of Christ, and are anew created unto righteousness and true holiness, and in consequence thereof live righteously; these walk by faith on Christ, and as becomes his Gospel; and in all the ordinances of it, and in all the duties of religion; and the Gospel teaches all those that receive and profess it to do the same. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">that thou mayest</span> &c.] The construction is still dependent on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/2-10.htm" title="When wisdom enters into your heart, and knowledge is pleasant to your soul;...">Proverbs 2:10-11</a></span>.

The protecting power of wisdom is developed in a positive direction. Negatively, it delivers from the evil man and from the strange woman, but it does more - "it shall keep thee in order that thou mayest walk in a good way," etc. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">l'maan</span>) is coordinate with "to deliver thee," but it serves to bring the discourse to a conclusion. Umbreit renders it "therefore," thus making what follows an inference from the preceding discourse. So the Syriac, <span class="accented">ambula igitur</span>, "therefore walk." <span class="cmt_word">In the way of good men</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">b'derek tovim</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the way of the good, in an ethical  sense, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the upright, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">in via bona</span>, "in the good way." "The way of good men" is the way of God's commandments, the way of obedience. <span class="cmt_word">Keep</span>. The Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shamar</span>) is here used in the sense of "to observe," "to attend to," but in a different sense from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-4.htm">Psalm 17:4</a>, "I have observed the ways of the violent man," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that I might avoid them. To keep the paths of the righteous is to carefully attend to the life of obedience which they follow. The LXX. closely connects this verse with the preceding, and renders, "For if they had walked in good ways, they would have found the paths of righteousness light." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this verse the regimen of the &#1502;&#1503;, 12b, is to be regarded as lost; the description now goes on independently. Whoever does not shrink back from evil, but gives himself up to deceit, who finally is at home in it as in his own proper life-element, and rejoices, yea, delights in that which he ought to shun as something destructive and to be rejected. The neut. &#1512;&#1506; is frequently an attributive genit., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-26.htm">Proverbs 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-5.htm">Proverbs 28:5</a>; cf. &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-25.htm">Proverbs 24:25</a>, which here, since &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; are those who in themselves are bad, does not separate, but heightens: perversitates non simplices aut vulgares, sed pessimae et ex omni parte vitiosae (J.

Fleischer, Bertheau, and others interpret &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, as the accus. of the nearer definition, as &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;; but should it be an accus., then would we expect, in this position of the words, &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-8.htm">Isaiah 59:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-8.htm">Proverbs 10:8</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-15.htm">Proverbs 9:15</a>). &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; is the pred.; for &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;, like &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, admits of both genders. &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1500;&#1493;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; carries in it its subject &#1492;&#1501;; &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494;, like the Arab. l'd, l'dh, is a weaker form of &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, flectere, inclinare, intrans. recedere: they are turned aside, inclined out of the way to the right and left in their walk (&#1489;&#1468; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-20.htm">Proverbs 17:20</a>). </body></html>
