When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The guide of her youth - Better, the familiar friend (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a>).

Not God, the God of her life, and who had provided for her from her youth up; nor her parent that had taken care of her in her infancy, and had been the guardian of her virgin state; but her husband, to whom she was married in her youth, and to whom she gave up herself to be guided and directed, ruled and governed, by: and as it is an aggravation of evil in a man to deal treacherously against the wife of his youth, and the wife of his covenant, <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>; so it is in a woman to forsake "the friend" or "companion of her youth" (w), as the phrase may be rendered; who loved her and espoused her in his youthful age, and with whom he had lived long in love and friendship, and in great happiness, but now forsakes him; her affections being alienated from him, leaves his company and bed, and associates with others. Gersom interprets this of the human understanding, appointed to govern the other powers and faculties of the soul; <p>and forgetteth the covenant of her God: not the covenant made with Noah, in which adultery, as well as other things, were forbidden; nor the law of Moses, or covenant at Sinai, in which it was condemned; but the marriage covenant, which she entered into with her husband when espoused to him, and when they mutually obliged themselves to be faithful to one another: and this is called "the covenant of God"; not only because God is the author and institutor of marriage, and has directed and enjoined persons to enter into such a contract with one another; but because he is present at it, and is a witness of such an engagement, mid is appealed unto in it; which, as it adds to the solemnity of it, makes the violation of it the more criminal. So the church of Rome has forsook Christ, who was her guide in her first settlement, and her husband she professed to be espoused to, as a chaste virgin; and has followed other lovers, and become the mother of harlots; so false teachers leave their guide, the Scriptures, and bring in damnable heresies, and deny the Lord that bought them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>. <p>(w)  "amieum adolescentiae suae", De Dieu, Michaelis; "socium juventutis suae", Schultens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Which forsaketh the <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</span><p>(k) That is, her husband, who is her head and guide to govern her, from whom she ought not to depart, but remain in his subjection.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">the guide of her youth</span>] or, <span class="ital">friend</span>, R.V. or, <span class="ital">associate</span>, i.e. her husband to whom she was married in her youth.

The word is rendered as "friend" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>. The idea of guidance, which is adopted in the Authorized Version, and appears also in the Vulgate <span class="accented">dux.</span> and Targum <span class="accented">ducatus</span>, is a secondary idea, and is derived probably from the relation in which the husband stands to his wife. Various interpretations have been given to the expression. It occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-4.htm">Jeremiah 3:4</a>, where Jehovah applies it to himself, and says, through his prophet, to the religiously adulterous Judah, "Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the Guide of my youth (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5bb;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="accented">alluph n'ura</span>)?" It has also been understood as referring to the woman's parents, her father and mother, who were her natural guardians. But the context seems to require that it should be taken as designating her <span class="accented">husband.</span> It will then be the correlative of "the wife of thy youth" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The covenant of her God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the marriage covenant, called "the covenant of her God,"  because entered into in his presence. The forsaking of the guide of her youth is essentially bound up with a forgetfulness of the solemn covenant which she had entered into in the presence of God. No specific mention is made in the Pentateuch of any religious ceremony at marriage; yet we may infer, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14, 15</a>, where God is spoken of as "a Witness" between the husband and "the wife of his youth," "the wife of thy covenant," that the marriage contract was solemnized with sacred rites. The Proverbs thus give a high and sacred character to marriage, and so carry on the original idea of the institution which, under the gospel dispensation, developed late the principle of the indissolubility of the marriage tie. It is no objection to this view that the monogamic principle was infringed, and polygamy countenanced. The reason of this latter departure is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-28.htm">Deuteronomy 22:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-16.htm">Exodus 22:16</a>. The morality of the Proverbs always represents monogamy as the rule, it deprecates illicit intercourse, and discountenances divorce. It is in entire accordance with the seventh commandment. The woman who commits adultery offends, not only against her husband, but against her God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the &#1488;&#1494; repeated, the promises encouraging to the endeavour after wisdom take a new departure:<p>9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and justice,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And uprightness; every way of good.<p>10 For wisdom will enter into thine heart,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And knowledge will do good to thy soul;<p>11 Discretion will keep watch over thee,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding will keep thee.<p>Regarding the ethical triad &#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; [righteousness, rightness], &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; [judgment], and &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; [rectitude], vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a>. Seb. Schmid is wrong in his rendering, et omnis via qua bonum aditur erit tibi plana, which in comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-7.htm">Isaiah 26:7</a> would be feebly expressed. J. H. Michaelis rightly interprets all these four conceptions as object-accusatives; the fourth is the summarizing asyndeton (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-7.htm">Psalm 8:7</a>) breaking off the enumeration: omnem denique orbitam boni; Jerome, bonam: in this case, however, &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; would be genitive (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a>). &#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500; is the way in which the chariot rolls along; in &#1506;&#1490;&#1500; there are united the root-conceptions of that which is found (&#1490;&#1500;) and rolling (&#1490;&#1500;). Whether &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>, is the argumentative "because" (according to the versions and most interpreters) or "for" ("denn," J. H. Michaelis, Ewald, and others), is a question. That with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  "for" the subject would precede the verb, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-21.htm">Proverbs 2:21</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a> (Hitzig), determines nothing, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a> shows. On the one hand, the opinion that &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  "because" is opposed by the analogy of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, following &#1488;&#1494;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5</a>; the inequality between <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5-8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>. if the new commencement, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-9.htm">Proverbs 2:9</a>, at once gives place to another, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>; the relationship of the subject ideas in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a>, which makes <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a> unsuitable to be a conclusion from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>. On the contrary, the promise not only of intellectual, but at the same time also of practical, insight into the right and the good, according to their whole compass and in their manifoldness, can be established or explained quite well as we thus read <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a> : For wisdom will enter (namely, to make it a dwelling-place, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>) into thine heart, and knowledge will do good to thy soul (namely, by the enjoyment which arises from the possession of knowledge, and the rest which its certainty yields). &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, is elsewhere fem.
