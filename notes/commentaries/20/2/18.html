When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The house of the adulteress is as Hades, the realm of death, haunted by the spectral shadows of the dead (Rephaim, see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10</a> note), who have perished there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. inclineth&#8212;sinks down (compare Nu 13:31).<p>the dead&#8212;or shades of the departed (Ps 88:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Her house inclineth unto death, </span> conversation with her (which was most free and usual in her own house) is the ready and certain way to death, which it brings many ways; by wasting a man’s vital spirits, and shortening his life; by exposing him to many and dangerous diseases, which physicians have declared and proved to be the effects of inordinate lust; as also to the fury of jealous husbands or friends, and sometimes to the sword of civil justice, and undoubtedly, without repentance, to God’s wrath and the second death.

The objection to the Authorized Version is that it does not tbllow the construction of the original, the verb "sinks down" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">shakhah</span>) being feminine, while "house" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">bayith</span>) is invariably masculine. Aben Ezra translates, "She sinks down to death, (which is to be) her house;" but it seems better to regard "her house" as an adjunct of the strange woman. Her house includes all who belong to her. She and they are involved in the same fate. The Authorized Version is evidently influenced by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Inclinata est enim ad mortem domus ejus</span>, "For her house is inclined to death." The LXX. gives a different rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "For she hath placed her house beside death." So the Arabic. The "for" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="accented">ki</span>) refers back to ver. 16, and indicates how great is the deliverance effected by wisdom. The meaning of the passage is aptly illustrated by <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-27.htm">Proverbs 7:27</a>, "Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death." <span class="cmt_word">And her paths unto the dead.</span> <span class="accented">The dead</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">r'phaim</span>) are properly the quiet, or the feeble.
