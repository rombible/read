It would often, no doubt, happen that the owner would die without disclosing the place of concealment to any one else, and the treasure thus be lost. Hunting after such hoards has in consequence been always of the keenest interest to Orientals, and as such furnishes the groundwork for one of our Lord’s parables (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-44.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to treasure hid in a field; the which when a man has found, he hides, and for joy thereof goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.">Matthew 13:44</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-9 Those who earnestly seek heavenly wisdom, will never complain that they have lost their labour; and the freeness of the gift does not do away the necessity of our diligence, Joh 6:27. Let them seek, and they shall find it; let them ask, and it shall be given them. Observe who are thus favoured. They are the righteous, on whom the image of God is renewed, which consists in righteousness. If we depend upon God, and seek to him for wisdom, he will enable us to keep the paths of judgment.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Note the illustrations.<p>(1) Contact with Phoenician commerce, and joint expeditions in ships of Tarshish (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a> note), had made the Israelites familiar with the risks and the enterprise of the miller's life.

That is, wisdom, knowledge, and understanding; which all signify and relate unto one and the same thing, expressed here by "her": namely, the doctrine of wisdom, or Christ; that is, the Gospel, and a spiritual and experimental knowledge and understanding of it, and the truths thereof; which are as desirable and valuable as silver, and more so; and which may be fitly compared to it, and be preferred before it, for their purity, solidity, and duration; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-72.htm">Psalm 119:72</a>; and are to be sought after with as much and more eagerness, affection, and diligence, as silver is by those who are most covetous of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-10.htm">Proverbs 8:10</a>; <p>and searchest for her as for hid treasures; the Gospel is a treasure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>; an accumulation of riches. It contains rich truths, things valuable for their antiquity; for being far fetched and dearly bought, coming from heaven, and sealed by the blood of Christ, and the holy martyrs of Jesus; and for the abundance of them; there are treasures of wisdom and knowledge in the Gospel, and in Christ the sum and substance of it, who is full of truth as well as grace, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>. It contains rich blessings of grace, such as are spiritual, solid, and substantial, sure and irreversible; and a multitude of them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-29.htm">Romans 15:29</a>; and also rich promises, exceeding great and precious ones; which are absolute and unconditional, suited to the various cases of God's people, and sure to all the seed: and it reveals the riches of God's goodness, his special goodness in Christ; the unsearchable riches of Christ; and the riches both of grace and glory. And under this notion of a treasure is it to be searched for, and as an hid treasure; in allusion to what is laid up in the cabinets of princes, or lies in the bowels of the earth, as precious stones: Pliny (m) says, that "topazin", in the language of the Troglodytes, has the signification of seeking, because "topazes" are diligently sought for and searched after; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-19.htm">Job 28:19</a>. The Gospel, and the truths of it, were greatly hid under the former dispensation from the Gentile world, and very much from the Jews themselves; being wrapped up in dark prophecies, obscure hints, and shadowy types and sacrifices; and are now, and always were, entirely hid from the wicked and reprobate part of the world, from them that are lost, and from God's own elect before conversion. This is "the fellowship of the mystery" that was "hid in God", in his heart, from all eternity, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>, the truths of it are the "treasures of wisdom and knowledge hid" in Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>; and likewise the "treasure hid in the field" of the Scriptures, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-44.htm">Matthew 22:44</a>; which therefore are to be searched into for them, with like labour and resolution with which men dig into the earth, to find the rich ore that is in the bowels of it: and this should be done by diligent reading them; by frequent and deep meditation on them; by constant hearing the truths of the Gospel preached; by earnest prayer for the illumination of the divine Spirit to understand them; and by all the help of the writings of good men, and conversation with them, that can be had. These are things to be sought for and searched after, in the first place, in the early time of life; and with the utmost diligence and labour, as being of the greatest moment and importance. <p>(m) Nat.

See, for example, Dean Plumptre’s interesting note on this verse in the <span class="ital">Speaker’s Commentary</span>. It may well be doubted, however, whether by <span class="ital">silver</span> be not rather meant, <span class="ital">money</span>, or <span class="ital">wealth</span>, generally. LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἀργύριον</span>, Vulg. <span class="ital">pecuniam</span>. Comp. <span class="greekheb">φιλαργυρία</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-10.htm" title="For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.">1 Timothy 6:10</a>; <span class="greekheb">ἀφιλάργυρος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-5.htm" title="Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as you have: for he has said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you.">Hebrews 13:5</a>. (See Smith’s <span class="ital">Bible Dict</span>., Art. Silver: “its chief use was as a medium of exchange, and throughout the O.T. we find <span class="ital">ceseph, silver</span>, used for money, like the Fr. <span class="ital">argent</span>.”) We are told that silver, as a metal, was “nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-21.htm" title="And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.">1 Kings 10:21</a>. So again it is doubtful whether any great stress is to be laid upon “<span class="ital">hid</span> treasures” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-44.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to treasure hid in a field; the which when a man has found, he hides, and for joy thereof goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.">Matthew 13:44</a>). The word here is lit. “<span class="ital">hidden things</span>,” and so, <span class="ital">treasures</span>, because we hide them for safety (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-23.htm" title="And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.">Genesis 43:23</a>, A.V. and R.V. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-3.htm" title="And I will give you the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that you may know that I, the LORD, which call you by your name, am the God of Israel.">Isaiah 45:3</a>). The LXX. render <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὡς θησαυροὺς ἐξερευνήσῃς</span>, Vulg. <span class="ital">si … sicut thesauros effoderis</span>. It is rather the value set upon Wisdom, than the difficulty of search for her that is here in view. She is a gift, after all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm" title="For the LORD gives wisdom: out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.">Proverbs 2:6</a>), though a gift to those only who seek her diligently (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/11-5.htm" title="And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;...">Luke 11:5-13</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou seekest,</span> etc. The climax in the series of conditions is reached in this verse; and the imagery employed in both clauses indicates that the search after Wisdom is to be <span class="accented">persevering</span>, unrelaxing, and diligent, like the unremitting toil and labour with which men carry on mining operations. "To seek" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">bakash</span>) in the original is properly "to seek diligently" (piel), and is kindred to "to search" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>, <span class="accented">khaphas</span>), which again is equivalent to "to dig" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">khaphar</span>), the Vulgate <span class="accented">effodere</span>, "to dig out." Compare the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-21.htm">Job 3:21</a>, "And dig for it more than for hid treasures." We trace in these verbs the idea in the mind of the teacher indicated above, which finds expression also in the object of the search, the silver, in its crude state, and the hidden  treasures (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">mat'monim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> the treasures of gold, silver, and precious metal concealed in the earth. The comparison here made between the search for Wisdom and the search for the hidden treasures of the earth was not unfamiliar to the Hebrew mind, as it is found worked out with great beauty of detail in the twenty-eighth chapter of Job. Again, the comparison of Wisdom with things most precious in the estimation of man is natural and common, and occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-72.htm">Psalm 119:72</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-15.htm">Job 28:15-19</a>. The same ideas and comparisons here used are presented to us in the New Testament teaching, in our Lord's parable of the man who finds the hid treasure in the field, and, in the phraseology of St. Paul, who speaks of "all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge," and of "the unsearchable riches of Christ." "Divine knowledge is an inexhaustible mine of precious ore" (Wardlaw). The language of the Proverbs would receive additional three from the circumstances of the reign of Solomon, the most splendid and prosperous era in the annals of the Jewish national history, in the means taken to secure the treasures of other and distant countries; the wealth and the riches of that reign (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-22</a>) would help to bring out the idea of the superlative value of Wisdom. In no era of the Jewish national history was there such abundance of riches, such splendid prosperity, as in the reign of Solomon, whose ships of Tarshish brought "gold and silver" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-22</a>), and this state of things would give point to the comparisons which the teacher uses in our text. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then - this sublime preacher in the streets continues - distress shall teach them to pray:<p>28 Then shall they call on me, and I will not answer;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They shall early seek after me, and not find me;<p>29 Because that they hated knowledge,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And did not choose the fear of Jahve.<p>30 They have not yielded to my counsel,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despised all my reproof:<p>31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And satiate themselves with their own counsels.<p>In the full emphatic forms, &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, they shall call on me, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, they shall seek me, and &#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, they shall find me, the suffix &#1504;&#1497; may be joined to the old plur. ending u&#770;n (Gesenius, Olshausen, Bttcher); but open forms like &#1497;&#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, He will bless him,&#1497;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, He will honour me (from &#1497;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;), and the like, rather favour the conclusion that &#1504; is epenthetic (Ew. 250, b).<p>(Note: In the Codd. &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497; is written; in this case the Metheg indicates the tone syllable: vid., Torath Emeth, p. 7 note, p. 21 note; and Accentssystem, ii. 1, note.
