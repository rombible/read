When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Noticeable here is the Hebrew love of home and love of country.

LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">perdentur.</span>;The expression is used to convey the idea of extermination, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-9.htm">Psalm 37:9</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-17.htm">Job 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-35.htm">Psalm 104:35</a>). The verb is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>. <span class="accented">The earth</span>; properly, <span class="accented">the land.</span> The same word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;</span> <span class="accented">arets</span>) is used as in ver. 21. <span class="cmt_word">The transgressors</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">bog'dim</span>); here employed synonymously with "the wicked" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">y'shaim</span>), "the impious." The primary meaning of the verb from which it is derived (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, <span class="accented">bagad</span>) is "to cover," "to deal treacherously," and hence the word signifies those who act treacherously or perfidiously, the faithless. They are those who perfidiously depart from God, and break away from the covenant with Jehovah. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-3.htm">Proverbs 11:3, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-2.htm">Proverbs 13:2, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-12.htm">Proverbs 22:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-3.htm">Psalm 25:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/59-5.htm">Psalm 59:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a>). Shall be rooted out (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, <span class="accented">yiss'khu</span>). This word is taken by Davidson as the future kal of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nasah</span>), "to pluck up," and hence is equivalent to "they shall pluck up," or, passively, "they stroll be plucked up." Delitzsch remarks that it is as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-25.htm">Proverbs 15:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/52-7.htm">Psalm 52:7</a>, active, "they shall pluck up," and this with the subject remaining indefinite is equivalent to the passive form, "they shall be plucked up." This indefinite "they" can be used of God, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a> (Fleischer). The expression has been understood as referring to being driven into exile (Gesenius), and this view would be amply justified by the fate which overtook the apostate nation when both the kingdoms of Israel and Judah suffered this fate (cf. LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "they shall be driven out"). It also derives colour from the language of the preceding verse, but the imagery appears to be derived from the cutting down and rooting up of trees. The destruction of the wicked and transgressors will be complete. They shall be exterminated (cf. Targum, <span class="accented">eradicabuntur</span>; Syriac <span class="accented">evellentur</span>; and Arabic, <span class="accented">exterminabuntur</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the resumption of &#1500;&#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1498;, the watchful protection which wisdom affords to its possessors is further specified in these verses:<p>16 To save thee from the strange woman,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the stranger who useth smooth words;<p>The subject here continued is the fourfold wisdom named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-11.htm">Proverbs 2:11</a>. &#1494;&#1512; signifies alienus, which may also be equivalent to alius populi, but of a much wider compass - him who does not belong to a certain class (e.g., the non-priestly or the laity), the person or thing not belonging to me, or also some other than I designate; on the other hand, &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;, peregrinus, scarcely anywhere divests itself of the essential mark of a strange foreign origin.

Prostitution was partly sanctioned in the cultus of the Midianites, Syrians, and other nations neighbouring to Israel, and thus was regarded as nothing less than customary. In Israel, on the contrary, the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>.) forbade it under a penalty, and therefore it was chiefly practised by foreign women (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27</a>, and cf. the exception, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-10.htm">Ruth 2:10</a>),<p>(Note: In Talmudic Heb. &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; (Aramean) has this meaning for the Biblical &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;.)<p>an inveterate vice, which spread itself particularly from the latter days of Solomon, along with general ungodliness, and excusing itself under the polygamy sanctioned by the law, brought ruin on the state. The Chokma contends against this, and throughout presents monogamy as alone corresponding to the institution and the idea of the relation. Designating marriage as the "covenant of God," it condemns not only adulterous but generally promiscuous intercourse of the sexes, because unhallowed and thus unjustifiable, and likewise arbitrary divorce. Regarding the ancient ceremonies connected with the celebration of marriage we are not specially informed; but from <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a> (Ewald, Bertheau, Hitzig, but not Khler), it appears that the celebration of marriage was a religious act, and that they who were joined together in marriage called God to witness and ratify the vows they took upon themselves. The perf. in the attributive clause &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1511;&#1492; proceeds on the routine acquired in cajoling and dissembling: who has smoothed her words, i.e., learned to entice by flattering words (Fl.). </body></html>
