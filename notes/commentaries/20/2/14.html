When wisdom has dominion over us, then it not only fills the head, but enters into the heart, and will preserve, both against corruptions within and temptations without. The ways of sin are ways of darkness, uncomfortable and unsafe: what fools are those who leave the plain, pleasant, lightsome paths of uprightness, to walk in such ways! They take pleasure in sin; both in committing it, and in seeing others commit it. Every wise man will shun such company. True wisdom will also preserve from those who lead to fleshly lusts, which defile the body, that living temple, and war against the soul. These are evils which excite the sorrow of every serious mind, and cause every reflecting parent to look upon his children with anxiety, lest they should be entangled in such fatal snares. Let the sufferings of others be our warnings. Our Lord Jesus deters from sinful pleasures, by the everlasting torments which follow them. It is very rare that any who are caught in this snare of the devil, recover themselves; so much is the heart hardened, and the mind blinded, by the deceitfulness of this sin. Many think that this caution, besides the literal sense, is to be understood as a caution against idolatry, and subjecting the soul to the body, by seeking any forbidden object. The righteous must leave the earth as well as the wicked; but the earth is a very different thing to them. To the wicked it is all the heaven they ever shall have; to the righteous it is the place of preparation for heaven. And is it all one to us, whether we share with the wicked in the miseries of their latter end, or share those everlasting joys that shall crown believers?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The evil-doers here include not robbers and murderers only <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-16</a>, but all who leave the straight path and the open day for crooked ways, perverse counsels, deeds of darkness.

The wicked not only rejoice to do evil themselves, but they exult when they hear of evil in others (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-32.htm">Romans 1:32</a>). Such may be the interpretation, though the latter part, of the verse is capable of a different and more general rendering as signifying exultation in evil generally, whether it appears in themselves or others. The expression rendered in the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">in the frowardness of the wicked,</span> is in the original (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> <span class="accented">b'thah'pucoth ra</span>), <span class="accented">in the perverseness of evil</span>, or in evil perverseness, where the combination of the two nouns serves to give force to the main idea, which is that of perverseness. This rendering is adopted in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;</span>, "in evil distortion;" in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">in pessimis rebus</span>; in the Targum, Syriac, and Arabic, <span class="accented">in conversatione mala</span>, "in a bad course of conduct;" and in the Targum, <span class="accented">in malitiae perversione</span>, "in the perversion of wickedness." It is not perverseness in its simple and common form that these men exult in. but in its worst and most vicious form (for a similar construction, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-24.htm">Proverbs 6:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-26.htm">Proverbs 15:26</a>; and Proverbs 28:5).

If &#1488;&#1501; were intended (according to which the Targ. in the Bibl. rabbinica, but not in Norzi's text, translates), then 3b would correspond; vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-4.htm">Proverbs 7:4</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>.

In the principal clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5</a> the '&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/19-10.htm">Psalm 19:10</a>, is the fear of Jahve as it ought to be, thus the reverence which is due to Him, the worshipping of Him as revealed.

The thoughts revolve in a circle only apparently. He who strives after wisdom earnestly and really, reaches in this way fellowship with God; for just as He gives wisdom, it is nowhere else than with Him, and it never comes from any other source than from Him.

The former is the expression of the completed fact, as &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>, and is rightly preferred by lxx and Syr., for one reluctantly misses the copula (since the thought is new in comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1501; should be written with the accent Dech. The Chokma-word (besides in Proverbs and Job, found only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>) &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is a Hiphil formation (with the passing over of  into , as in &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1492;) from &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; (whence the pr. names &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;)  equals  (Arab.) wasy and a&#770;sy, to re-establish, to advance, Hiph. of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;  equals  &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, to stand, and thus means furtherance, i.e., the power or the gift to further, and concretely that which furthers and profits, particularly true wisdom and true fortune.<p>(Note: I was formerly in error in regarding the word as a Hophal formation, and in assigning to it the primary signification of being in a state of realized existence, of reality, in contradistinction to appearance only. The objection of J. D. Michaelis, Supplem. p. 1167, Non placent in linguis ejusmodi etyma metaphysica, etc., does not apply here, since the word is a new one coined by the Chokma, but all the shades of meaning are naturally derived from the fundamental signification "furtherance" (cf. Seneca, Deus stator stabilitorque est). "&#1514;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;, from Arab. a&#770;sy and wasy, to further by word and deed, to assist by counsel and act, to render help, whence the meanings auxilium, salus, and prudens consilium, sapientia, easily follow; cf. Ali's Arab. proverb, "He furthers thee, who does not trouble himself about thee.")<p>The derivation from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-21.htm">Proverbs 8:21</a>) is to be rejected, because "the formation would be wholly without analogy, so much the more because the &#1497; of this word does not represent the place of the &#1493;, as is seen from the Arab. l-ys and the Syr. lyt" (Fl.);<p>(Note: The Arab. &#8219;aysa (almost only in the negative la-ysa  equals  &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;), of the same signification as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, with which the Aram. &#1488;&#1497;&#1514; (&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;) is associated, presupposes an &#8219;a&#770;sa ( equals  &#8219;a&#770;ssa), to be founded, to found, and is rightly regarded by the Arabs as an old segolate noun in which the verbal force was comprehended.)<p>and the derivation of &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;, to be smooth (Hitzig), passes over without any difficulty into another system of roots.<p>(Note: The Arab. wsy and swy are confounded in common usage (Wetstein, Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitschr. xxii. 19), but the roots &#1493;&#1513; and &#1513;&#1493; are different; &#1493;&#1513; and &#1488;&#1513;, on the contrary, are modifications of one root.)<p>In the passage under consideration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>), &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; signifies advancement in the sense of true prosperity.
