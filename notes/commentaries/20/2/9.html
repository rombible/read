Let them seek, and they shall find it; let them ask, and it shall be given them. Observe who are thus favoured. They are the righteous, on whom the image of God is renewed, which consists in righteousness.

This is another fruit and effect of the Gospel, and of a spiritual understanding of it; that besides the knowledge of God, and how to behave with reverence towards him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-5.htm">Proverbs 2:5</a>; it leads men into a notion of doing that which is right and just among men; it gives them not only a theoretic but a practical understanding of justice, and a true judgment of what is right and wrong; or gives such an understanding thereof as that they practise it; for it teaches men to live soberly, righteously, and godly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11</a>. It is not only a revelation and ministration of the righteousness of Christ as the only matter of a sinner's justification before God; and informs a man's judgment so that he can distinguish between truth and error, right and wrong, good and bad notions and practices; but it influences his actions, life, and conversation, and engages him to do works of righteousness from the best principles, upon the best motives, and with the best views; <p>and equity; yea, every good path; that is, so to understand equity, as to do that which is equitable between man and man; and to understand every good path which the word of God directs to, even all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, so as to walk in them; these things the Gospel acquaints men with, and urges them to observe: or the words may be rendered, either "the rectitude" or "equity of fall good paths", as the Syriac version; how just, and right, and plain, and equitable, everyone is, and therefore ought to be walked in; or "plainnesses", or "most plain", is or shall be "every good path" (r), to them that have a spiritual and experimental knowledge of the Gospel; and by it an understanding of their duty. One word signifies "plain" and "straight", and another "round" (s), and both are true of the path of righteousness; for though it is a circle of duty saints walk in, yet straight and plain. <p>(r) So Schmidt.

As the former referred to God, so this appears to refer more especially to man, and thus we have stated the whole benefit, in its twofold aspect, which Wisdom confers on those who diligently seek her. It is not to be affirmed, however, that righteousness and judgment and equity refer exclusively to man; they must represent some aspects of our relationship to God, both from the meaning of the words themselves, and because the law which regulates our dealings and intercourse with man has its seat in the higher law of our relation to God. <span class="cmt_word">Righteousness, and judgment, and equity.</span> These three words occur in the same collocation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-3.htm">Proverbs 1:3</a>, which see. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, every good path.</span> "Yea" does not occur in the original.

The objection of J. D. Michaelis, Supplem. p. 1167, Non placent in linguis ejusmodi etyma metaphysica, etc., does not apply here, since the word is a new one coined by the Chokma, but all the shades of meaning are naturally derived from the fundamental signification "furtherance" (cf. Seneca, Deus stator stabilitorque est). "&#1514;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;, from Arab. a&#770;sy and wasy, to further by word and deed, to assist by counsel and act, to render help, whence the meanings auxilium, salus, and prudens consilium, sapientia, easily follow; cf. Ali's Arab. proverb, "He furthers thee, who does not trouble himself about thee.")<p>The derivation from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-21.htm">Proverbs 8:21</a>) is to be rejected, because "the formation would be wholly without analogy, so much the more because the &#1497; of this word does not represent the place of the &#1493;, as is seen from the Arab. l-ys and the Syr. lyt" (Fl.);<p>(Note: The Arab. &#8219;aysa (almost only in the negative la-ysa  equals  &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;), of the same signification as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, with which the Aram. &#1488;&#1497;&#1514; (&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;) is associated, presupposes an &#8219;a&#770;sa ( equals  &#8219;a&#770;ssa), to be founded, to found, and is rightly regarded by the Arabs as an old segolate noun in which the verbal force was comprehended.)<p>and the derivation of &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;  equals  &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1492;, to be smooth (Hitzig), passes over without any difficulty into another system of roots.<p>(Note: The Arab. wsy and swy are confounded in common usage (Wetstein, Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitschr. xxii. 19), but the roots &#1493;&#1513; and &#1513;&#1493; are different; &#1493;&#1513; and &#1488;&#1513;, on the contrary, are modifications of one root.)<p>In the passage under consideration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>), &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; signifies advancement in the sense of true prosperity.
