For it is only beating the air, and speaking to the wind; it is casting pearls before swine, and that which is holy to dogs. By the "fool" is meant a wicked man, one abandoned to sin, and hardened in it; that scoffs at all admonitions and reproofs, that derides the word, and the preachers of it, and makes a mock at all good men, and everything they say; and therefore what is serious and sacred should not be said to them, since it only becomes the object of their banter and ridicule; <p>for he will despise the wisdom of thy words; not only the words of doctrine, reproof, and correction, but the "wisdom" of them; or let them be ever so wisely spoken; for if the wisdom of God and his words, the truths of the Gospel, are foolishness with such, and despised by them, then much more the wisdom even of the best of men, and the wisest things they say; yea, when they deliver the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom, the Gospel of Christ, which therefore should be spoken among them that are perfect, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Here is another case in which "sweet words" are lost. <span class="cmt_word">Speak not in the</span> <span class="cmt_word">ears of a fool.</span> This does not mean, as it would in our English phrase - whisper not to a fool; but do not take the trouble to try to make him understand, impart nothing to him. The "fool" here (<span class="accented">kesil</span>) is the dull,  stolid, stupid man. who cannot be moved from his own narrow groove (see on Proverbs 1:22). It is a mere casting of pearls before swine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>) to speak to such a man of high aims, righteous motives, self-sacrifice (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-8.htm">Proverbs 9:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He will despise the wisdom of thy words.</span> He cannot enter into the meaning of words of wisdom; he has no appetite for them, he cannot assimilate them; and in his self-satisfied dulness he feels for them nothing but contempt (Ecclus. 22:7, etc., "Whoso teacheth a fool is as one that glueth a potsherd together, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep.

The fut. &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; clothes the admonition in the form of a wish or counsel; the infin. intens. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; makes it urgent: consider well him whom thou hast before thee, viz., that he is not thine equal, but one higher, who can destroy thee as well as be useful to thee. With &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468; the jussive construction begun by &#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503; is continued. Zckler and Dchsel, after Ewald and Hitzig, translate incorrectly: thou puttest..., the perf. consec. after an imperf., or, which is the same thing, a fut. meant optatively (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a> with &#1500;&#1488;, and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a> without &#1500;&#1488;) continues the exhortation; to be thus understood, the author ought to have used the expression &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468; and not &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1514; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;. Rightly Luther: "and put a knife to thy throat," but continuing: "wilt thou preserve thy life," herein caught in the same mistake of the idea with Jerome, the Syr., and Targ., to which &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; here separates itself. &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; (&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;) (Arab. with the assimilated a sikk&#305;&#770;n, plur. seka&#770;k&#305;&#770;n, whence seka&#770;k&#305;&#770;ni, cutler) designates a knife (R. &#1505;&#1498; &#1513;&#1498;, to stick, vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>). &#1500;&#1493;&#1506;, from &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, to devour, is the throat; the word in Aram. signifies only the cheek, while Lagarde seeks to interpret &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1498; infinitively in the sense of (Arab.) bwlw'ak, if thou longest for (from wl'a); but that would make 2b a tautology. The verb &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; (cf. Arab. l'al', to pant for) shows for the substantive the same primary meaning as glutus from glutire, which was then transferred from the inner organ of swallowing (Kimchi, &#1489;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492;, Parchon; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1496;, aesophagus) to the external. "Put a knife to thy throat, is a proverbial expression, like our: the knife stands at his throat; the poet means to say: restrain thy too eager desire by means of the strongest threatening of danger - threaten as it were death to it" (Fleischer). In &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; means, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-2.htm">Proverbs 13:2</a>, desire, and that desire of eating, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>. Rightly Rashi: if thou art greedy with hunger, if thou art a glutton; cf. Sir. 34:12 (31:12), "If thou sittest at a great table, then open not widely thy throat (&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;), and say not: There is certainly much on it!" The knife thus denotes the restraining and moderating of too good an appetite.<p>In 3a the punctuation fluctuates between &#1514;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493; (Michlol 131a) and &#1514;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;; the latter is found in Cod. 1294, the Erfurt 2 and 3, the Cod. Jaman., and thus it is also to be written at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-1.htm">Proverbs 24:1</a>; &#1493;&#1497;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-17.htm">1 Chronicles 11:17</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm">Psalm 45:12</a>, Codd. and older Edd. (e.g., Complut. 1517, Ven. 1515, 1521) write with Pathach. &#1502;&#1496;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, from &#1496;&#1506;&#1501;, signifies savoury dishes, dainties, like (Arab.) dhwa&#770;kt, from dha&#770;k (to taste, to relish); cf. sapores, from sapere, in the proverb: the tit-bits of the king burn the lips (vid., Fleischer, Ali's Hundred Proverbs, etc., pp. 71, 104). With &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; begins, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-29.htm">Proverbs 3:29</a>, a conditioning clause: since it is, indeed, the bread of deceit (the connection like &#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1495;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-28.htm">Proverbs 21:28</a>), food which, as it were, deceives him who eats it, i.e., appears to secure for him the lasting favour of princes, and often enough herein deceives him; cf. the proverb by Burckhardt and Meidani: whoever eats of the sultan's soup burns his lips, even though it may be after a length of time (Fleischer). One must come near to a king, says Calovius, hitting the meaning of the proverb, as to a fire: not too near, lest he be burned; nor too remote, so that he may be warmed therewith. </body></html>
