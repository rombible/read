Wine, company, and the gayety which attends entertainments, often invite men to be too free in the use of meat and drink; and it is by these that kings frequently prove the fidelity and the secrecy of their confidants.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-3 God's restraints of the appetite only say, Do thyself no harm. 4,5. Be not of those that will be rich. The things of this world are not happiness and a portion for a soul; those that hold them ever so fast, cannot hold them always, cannot hold them long. 6-8. Do not make thyself burdensome to any, especially those not sincere. When we are called by God to his feast, and to let our souls delight themselves, Isa 25:6; 55:2, we may safely partake of the Bread of life. 9. It is our duty to take all fit occasions to speak of Divine things; but if what a wise man says will not be heard, let him hold his peace. 10,11.

Either a supreme ruler, a king, or a subordinate ruler, a nobleman, a judge, a civil magistrate, a person of honour, dignity, and authority; and to sit at table with such is sometimes allowed, and is always reckoned an honour; this particularly diligent and industrious persons are admitted to, who not only are brought to stand before kings and great persons, but to sit at table with them, and eat food with them. And now the wise man advises such how to behave themselves when this is the case: <p>consider diligently what is before thee; or, "considering consider" (q): take special notice of the food and drink set upon the table, and consider well which may be most proper and safe to eat and drink of; for though a man may lawfully eat of whatsoever is set before him; every creature of God being good, if it be received with thanksgiving, and sanctified by the word of God and prayer; yet it is a piece of wisdom to make use of that which is most conducive to health, and less ensnaring; and to observe moderation in all, and not indulge to gluttony and drunkenness: and he should consider also who is before him, which sense the words wilt bear; the ruler that has invited him, and sits at the table with him, and take care that he says or does nothing that may give him offence; and also the noble personages that are guests with him, and behave towards them suitably to their rank and dignity; observe their words and conduct, and imitate the same; yea, even he should consider the servants and waiters that attend, lest, behaving in an indecent and disorderly manner, they should report it to his disadvantage to their ruler or others. But how much greater an honour is it to sit at table with the King of kings, and with his princes, and sup with him! when it becomes the saints, who have this honour, to consider what is set before them; the richest dainties, a feast of things, the body and blood of Christ, which should he spiritually discerned by faith; and not the elements of bread and wine only: likewise the persons before whom they are should be considered; Christ, who sits at his table, and the princes of his people with him; and therefore should not feed without fear, and in a disorderly and indecent manner, as the Corinthians are charged, but with all reverence and humility. <p>(q)  "considerando considera", Pagninus, Vatablus, Piscator, Mercerus, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> consider diligently what <i>is</i> before thee:</span><p>(a) Eat with sobriety.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">what</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">who</span>.

Take heed lest the unusual dainties on the table tempt thee to excess, which may lead not only to unseemly behaviour, but also to unruly speech, revealing of secrets, etc. But the latter words may also be tendered, "him that is," or, "<span class="accented">who</span> is before thee." And this gives a very appropriate sense. The guest is enjoined to fix his attention, not on the delicate food, but on the host, who is his superior, and able to exalt and to destroy him (compare the cautious maxims in Ecclus. 13:2, 6, 7, 11, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Another tetrastich follows:<p>24 Have no intercourse with an angry man,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with a furious man go thou not;<p>25 Lest thou adopt his ways,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And bring destruction upon thy soul.<p>The Piel &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/14-20.htm">Judges 14:20</a>, signifies to make or choose any one as a friend or companion (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, &#1512;&#1506;); the Hithpa. &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; (cf. at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-24.htm">Proverbs 18:24</a>), to take to oneself (for oneself) any one as a friend, or to converse with one; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1512;&#1506; sounds like &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, with Pathach of the closed syllable from the apocope.

This &#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1488;&#1514; is not a trace of a more recent period of the language. Also &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, discas, cannot be an equivalent for it: Heb. poetry has at all times made use of Aramaisms as elegancies. &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, Arab. &#1488;&#1500;&#1507;, &#1497;&#1500;&#1507;, Arab. a&#770;lifa, signifies to be entrusted with anything  equals  to learn (Piel &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507;, to teach, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>, and in Elihu's speeches), or also to become confidential with one (whence &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, companion, confidant, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>); this &#1488;&#1500;&#1507; is never a Heb. prose word; the bibl. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; is only used at a later period in the sense of teacher. &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; .reh are the ways, the conduct (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-20.htm">Proverbs 2:20</a>, etc.), or manner of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>) which any one enters upon and follows out, thus manners as well as lot, condition. In the phrase "to bring destruction," &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; is used as in our phrase Schaden nehmen [to suffer injury]; the ancient language also represented the forced entrance of one into a state as a being laid hold on, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/18-20.htm">Job 18:20</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>; here &#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; is not merely equivalent to danger (Ewald, falsely: that thou takest not danger for thy soul), but is equivalent to destruction, sin itself is a snare (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-6.htm">Proverbs 29:6</a>); to bring a snare for oneself is equivalent to suffer from being ensnared. Whosoever comes into a near relation with a passionate, furious, man, easily accommodates himself to his manners, and, hurried forward by him and like him to outbreaks of anger, which does that which is not right before God, falls into ruinous complications. </body></html>
