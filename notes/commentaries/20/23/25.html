Here we have an earnest call to young people, to attend to the advice of their godly parents. If the heart be guided, the steps will be guided. Buy the truth, and sell it not; be willing to part with any thing for it. Do not part with it for pleasures, honours, riches, or any thing in this world. The heart is what the great God requires. We must not think to divide the heart between God and the world; he will have all or none. Look to the rule of God's word, the conduct of his providence, and the good examples of his people. Particular cautions are given against sins most destructive to wisdom and grace in the soul. It is really a shame to make a god of the belly. Drunkenness stupifies men, and then all goes to ruin. Licentiousness takes away the heart that should be given to God. Take heed of any approaches toward this sin, it is very hard to retreat from it. It bewitches men to their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The three forms of evil that destroy reputation and tempt to waste are brought together.<p>Drowsiness - Specially the drunken sleep, heavy and confused.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24, 25.

The way merely, is the one that is right in contrast to the many byways. Fleischer: "the way sensu eximio, as the Oriental mystics called the way to perfection merely (Arab.) a&#770;lat&#803;ryk&#803;; and him who walked therein, a&#770;lsa&#770;lak, the walker or wanderer."<p>(Note: Rashi reads &#1489;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1500;&#1489;&#1498; (walk), in the way of thy heart (which has become wise), and so Heidenheim found it in an old MS; but &#1489;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; is equivalent to &#1489;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-6.htm">Proverbs 9:6</a>.)<p>&#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; &#1489;, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-26.htm">Proverbs 22:26</a>, the "Words of the Wise," are to be compared in point of style. The degenerate and perverse son is more clearly described, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-20.htm">Deuteronomy 21:20</a>, as &#1494;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; &#1493;&#1505;&#1489;&#1488;. These two characteristics the poet distributes between 20a and 20b. &#1505;&#1489;&#1488; means to drink (whence &#1505;&#1489;&#1488;, drink  equals  wine, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>) wine or other intoxicating drinks; Arab. saba&#770;, vinum potandi causa emere. To the &#1497;&#1497;&#1503; here added, &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; in the parallel member corresponds, which consequently is not the fleshly body of the gluttons themselves, but the prepared flesh which they consume at their luxurious banquets. The lxx incorrectly as to the word, but not contrary to the sense, "be no wine-bibber, and stretch not thyself after picknicks (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;), and buying in of flesh (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;)," whereby &#1494;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497; is translated in the sense of the Aram. &#1494;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; (Lagarde). &#1494;&#1500;&#1500; denotes, intransitively, to be little valued (whence &#1494;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, opp. &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-19.htm">Jeremiah 15:19</a>), transitively to value little, and as such to squander, to lavish prodigally; thus: qui prodigi sunt carnis sibi; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; is dat. commodi. Otherwise Gesenius, Fleischer, Umbreit, and Ewald: qui prodigi sunt carnis suae, who destroy their own body; but the parallelism shows that flesh is meant wherewith they feed themselves, not their own flesh (&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;, like &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1502;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/58-5.htm">Psalm 58:5</a>), which, i.e., its health, they squander. &#1494;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500; also, in phrase used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-20.htm">Deuteronomy 21:20</a> (cf. with Hitzig the formula &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>), denotes not the dissolute person, as the sensualist, &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (lxx), but the &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Aquila, Symmachus, Theodotion), &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (Venet.), &#1494;&#1500;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; (Onkelos), i.e., flesh-eater, ravenous person, glutton, in which sense it is rendered here, by the Syr. and Targ., by &#1488;&#1505;&#1493;&#1496; (&#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1496;), i.e., &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. Regarding the metaplastic fut. Niph. &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;), vid., at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-13.htm">Proverbs 20:13</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>. &#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (after the form of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1490;&#1492;, &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;) is drowsiness, lethargy, long sleeping, which necessarily follows a life of riot and revelry. Such a slothful person comes to a bit of bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-17.htm">Proverbs 21:17</a>); and the disinclination and unfitness for work, resulting from night revelry, brings it about that at last he must clothe himself in miserable rags. The rags are called &#1511;&#1512;&#1506; and &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, from the rending (tearing), Arab. ruk'at, from the patching, mending. Lagarde, more at large, treats of this word here used for rags. </body></html>
