Here we have an earnest call to young people, to attend to the advice of their godly parents. If the heart be guided, the steps will be guided. Buy the truth, and sell it not; be willing to part with any thing for it. Do not part with it for pleasures, honours, riches, or any thing in this world. The heart is what the great God requires. We must not think to divide the heart between God and the world; he will have all or none. Look to the rule of God's word, the conduct of his providence, and the good examples of his people. Particular cautions are given against sins most destructive to wisdom and grace in the soul. It is really a shame to make a god of the belly. Drunkenness stupifies men, and then all goes to ruin. Licentiousness takes away the heart that should be given to God. Take heed of any approaches toward this sin, it is very hard to retreat from it. It bewitches men to their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Riotous eaters of flesh - The word is the same as "glutton" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-21.htm">Proverbs 23:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-20.htm">Deuteronomy 21:20</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. riotous &#8230; flesh&#8212;prodigal, or eating more than necessary.

But the parallelism with the wine drinker shows plainly that the flesh which they eat is meant, and the idea is that they eat for the gratification of their own appetites, caring nothing for anything else. The combination of glutton and wine bibber was used as a reproach against our blessed Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>). The versions of Jerome and the LXX. point to the contributed entertainments, where each guest brought some article to the meal, like our picnics. Thus Vulgate, "Be not among parties of drinkers, nor at the banquets of those who contribute flesh to eat;" Septuagint. "Be not a wine bibber, and strain not after contributed feasts (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) and purchases of meats." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13 Withhold not correction from the child;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For thou will beat him with the rod, and he will not die.<p>14 Thou beatest him with the rod,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And with it deliverest his soul from hell.<p>The exhortation, 13a, presupposes that education by word and deed is a duty devolving on the father and the teacher with regard to the child. In 13b, &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is in any case the relative conjunction. The conclusion does not mean: so will he not fall under death (destruction), as Luther also would have it, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>, for this thought certainly follows <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-14.htm">Proverbs 23:14</a>; nor after <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-18.htm">Proverbs 19:18</a> : so may the stroke not be one whereof he dies, for then the author ought to have written &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;; but: he will not die of it, i.e., only strike if he has deserved it, thou needest not fear; the bitter medicine will be beneficial to him, not deadly. The &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; standing before the double clause, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-14.htm">Proverbs 23:14</a>, means that he who administers corporal chastisement to the child, saves him spiritually; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; does not refer to death in general, but to death falling upon a man before his time, and in his sins, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-24.htm">Proverbs 15:24</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-26.htm">Proverbs 8:26</a>. </body></html>
