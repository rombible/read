Here is a parent correcting his child: accompanied with prayer, and blessed of God, it may prove a means of preventing his destruction. Here is a parent encouraging his child, telling him what would be for his good. And what a comfort it would be, if herein he answered his expectation! 17,18.

It was the duty of the &#1490;&#1488;&#1500;  ga&#772;'al, the next of kin, to take on himself, in case of murder, the office of avenger of blood <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-19.htm">Numbers 35:19</a>. By a slight extension the word was applied to one who took on himself a like office in cases short of this. Here, therefore, the thought is that, destitute as the fatherless may seem, there is One who claims them as His next of kin, and will avenge them. Yahweh Himself is in this sense their &#1490;&#1488;&#1500;  ga&#772;'al, their Redeemer. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837;, for the look of the evil eye, &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1512;&#1506;, &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488; &#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; (cattivo occhio), refers to enchantment; cf. &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, fascinare, to bewitch, to enchant, in modern Greek, to envy, Arab. 'an, to eye, as it were, whence ma&#8219;ju&#770;n, ma&#8219;&#305;&#770;n, hit by the piercing look of the envious eye, invidiae, as Apuleius says, letali plaga percussus (Fleischer). Regarding &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1488;&#1493; with Pathach, vid., the parallel line 3a. 7a is difficult. The lxx and Syr. read &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512; [hair]. The Targ. renders &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488; &#1512;&#1502;&#1488;, and thus reads &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; [fool], and thus brings together the soul of the envious person and a high portal, which promises much, but conceals only deception behind (Ralbag). Joseph ha-Nakdan reads<p>(Note: In an appendix to Ochla We-Ochla, in the University Library at Halle, he reads &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;, but with &#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1490;&#1488; [doubtful] added.)<p>&#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512; with sn; and Rashi, retaining the schn, compares the "sour figs," <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-17.htm">Jeremiah 29:17</a>. According to this, Luther translates: like a ghost (a monster of lovelessness) is he inwardly; for, as it appears in &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;, the goat-like spectre &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; hovered before him. Schultens better, because more in conformity with the text: quemadmodum suam ipsius animam abhorret (i.e., as he does nothing to the benefit of his own appetite) sic ille (erga alios multo magis). The thought is appropriate, but forced. Hitzig for once here follows Ewald; he does not, however, translate: "like as if his soul were divided, so is it;" but: "as one who is divided in his soul, so is he;" but the verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, to divide, is inferred from &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, gate  equals  division, and is as foreign to the extra-bibl. usus loq. as it is to the bibl. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; signifies to weigh or consider, to value, to estimate. These meanings Hitzig unites together: in similitudinem arioli et conjectoris aestimat quod ignorat, perhaps meaning thereby that he conjecturally supposes that as it is with him, so it is with others: he dissembles, and thinks that others dissemble also. Thus also Jansen explains. The thought is far-fetched, and does not cover itself by the text. The translation of the Venet. also: &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd; (perhaps: he measures to others as penuriously as to himself), does not elucidate the text, but obscures it. Most moderns (Bertheau, Zckler, Dchsel, etc.): as he reckons in his soul, so is he (not as he seeks to appear for a moment before thee). Thus also Fleischer: quemadmodum reputat apud se, ita est (sc. non ut loquitur), with the remark that &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; (whence &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;, measure, market value, Arab. si'r), to measure, to tax to as to determine the price, to reckon; and then like &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, in general, to think, and thus also Meri with the neut. rendering of ita est. But why this circumlocution in the expression? The poet ought in that case just to have written &#1499;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1502;&#1493; &#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1489;&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; &#1499;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;, for he is not as he speaks with his mouth. If one read &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; (Symmachus, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;), then we have the thought adapted to the portrait that is drawn; for like one calculating by himself, so is he, i.e., he is like one who estimates with himself the value of an object; for which we use the expression: he reckons the value of every piece in thy mouth. However, with this understanding the punctuation also of &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; as finite may be retained and explained after <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a> : for as if he reckoned in his soul, so is he; but in this the perf. is inappropriate; by the particip. one reaches the same end<p>(Note: We may write &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;: the Mehuppach (Jethb) sign of the Olewejored standing between the two words represents also the place of the Makkeph; vid., Thorath Emeth, p. 20.)<p>by a smoother way. True, he says to thee: eat and drink (Sol 5:1), he invites thee with courtly words; but his heart is not with thee (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>): he only puts on the appearance of joy if thou partakest abundantly, but there lurks behind the mask of liberal hospitality the grudging niggardly calculator, who poisons thy every bite, every draught, by his calculating, grudging look. Such a feast cannot possibly do good to the guest: thy meal (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1514;; cf. &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, Aram. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505; &#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1488;, to divide and distribute bread, whence &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1505;, to receive aliment, is derived) which thou hast eaten thou wilt spue out, i.e., wilt vomit from disgust that thou hast eaten such food, so that that which has been partaken of does thee no good. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; is also derived from &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;:<p>(Note: Immanuel makes so much of having recognised the verb in this &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; (and has he persuaded thee), that in the concluding part of his Divan (entitled Machberoth Immanuel), which is an imitation of Dante's Divina Commedia, he praises himself on this account in the paradise of King Solomon, who is enraptured by this explanation, and swears that he never meant that word otherwise.)<p>continued...</body></html>
