Here we have an earnest call to young people, to attend to the advice of their godly parents. If the heart be guided, the steps will be guided. Buy the truth, and sell it not; be willing to part with any thing for it. Do not part with it for pleasures, honours, riches, or any thing in this world. The heart is what the great God requires. We must not think to divide the heart between God and the world; he will have all or none. Look to the rule of God's word, the conduct of his providence, and the good examples of his people. Particular cautions are given against sins most destructive to wisdom and grace in the soul. It is really a shame to make a god of the belly. Drunkenness stupifies men, and then all goes to ruin. Licentiousness takes away the heart that should be given to God. Take heed of any approaches toward this sin, it is very hard to retreat from it. It bewitches men to their ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The three forms of evil that destroy reputation and tempt to waste are brought together.<p>Drowsiness - Specially the drunken sleep, heavy and confused.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24, 25.

Or "in rejoicing shall rejoice" (d), in his son; not that he is rich, but righteous, truly righteous, internally and externally; having the righteousness of Christ imputed to him, and righteousness and true holiness wrought in him, and so lives soberly, righteously, and godly: this must be understood of a father who is himself righteous; for otherwise wicked men, if their sons do but thrive in the world, they are unconcerned about their character as righteous, or their state and condition God-ward; <p>and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him; especially if he is wise in the best things; if he is wise unto salvation; he may be wise and knowing in things natural, have a good share of wit and sense, and be wise in worldly things, which may yield a pleasure to a natural man his parent; but, if he is a good man, he will have greater joy of his son if he is wise in the first sense. The mother and grandmother of Timothy had no doubt great joy of him, who, from a child, knew the holy Scriptures; and so had the elect lady of her children, who were walking in the truth; and so has our heavenly Father of his children, who are righteous and wise through his grace. <p>(d)  "exultando exultabit", Paguinus, Montanus, Mercerus, Gejerus, Michaelis; "gaudendo gaudebit", Cocceias. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice.</span> The father of a righteous son who has won truth and profited by the possession has good cause to be glad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>). Septuagint erroneously, "A righteous father brings up children well." The second clause repeats the first in different words, with the further idea that the wise son affords his father practical proof of the excellence of his moral training. The contrast is seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-21.htm">Proverbs 17:21</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet now shows how one attains unto wisdom - the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God:<p>17 Let not thine heart strive after sinners,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But after the fear of Jahve all the day.<p>18 Truly there is a future,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy hope shall not come to naught.<p>The lxx, Jerome, the Venet., and Luther, and the Arab. interpreters, render 17b as an independent clause: "but be daily in the fear of the Lord." That is not a substantival clause (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>), nor can it be an interjectional clause, but it may be an elliptical clause (Fleischer: from the prohibitive &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1511;&#1504;&#1488; is to be taken for the second parallel member the v. subst. lying at the foundation of all verbs); but why had the author omitted &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; dettim? Besides, one uses the expressions, to act (&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;), and to walk (&#1492;&#1500;&#1498;) in the fear of God, but not the expression to be (&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;) in the fear of God. Thus &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;, like &#1489;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, is dependent on &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488;; and Jerome, who translates: Non aemuletur cor tuum peccatores, sed in timore Domini esto tota die, ought to have continued: sed timorem Domini tota die; for, as one may say in Latin: aemulari virtutes, as well as aemulari aliquem, so also in Heb. &#1511;&#1504;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;, of the envying of those persons whose fortune excites to dissatisfaction, because one has not the same, and might yet have it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-31.htm">Proverbs 3:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-1.htm">Proverbs 24:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-19.htm">Proverbs 24:19</a>, as well as of emulation for a thing in which one might not stand behind others: envy not sinners, envy much rather the fear of God, i.e., let thyself be moved with eager desire after it when its appearance is presented to thee. There is no O.T. parallel for this, but the Syr. tan and the Greek &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; are used in this double sense. Thus Hitzig rightly, and, among the moderns, Malbim; with Aben Ezra, it is necessary to take &#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; for &#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;, this proverb itself declares the fear of God to be of all things the most worthy of being coveted.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-18.htm">Proverbs 23:18</a>, Umbreit, Elster, Zckler, and others interpret the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; as assigning a reason, and the &#1488;&#1501; as conditioning: for when the end (the hour of the righteous judgment) has come; Bertheau better, because more suitable to the &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; and the &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;: when an end (an end adjusting the contradictions of the present time) comes, as no doubt it will come, then thy hope will not be destroyed; but, on the other hand, the succession of words in the conclusion (vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>) opposes this; also one does not see why the author does not say directly &#1499;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, but expresses himself thus conditionally.<p>(Note: The form &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;&#1470; does not contradict the connection of the two particles. This use of the Makkeph is general, except in these three instances: <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-4.htm">Genesis 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-2.htm">Nehemiah 2:2</a>.)<p>If &#1488;&#1501; is meant hypothetically, then, with the lxx &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, we should supply after it &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, that had fallen out. Ewald's: much rather there is yet a future (Dchsel: much rather be happy there is...), is also impossible; for the preceding clause is positive, not negative. The particles &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, connected thus, mean: for if (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-32.htm">Lamentations 3:32</a>); or also relatively: that if (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-15.htm">Jeremiah 26:15</a>). After a negative clause they have the meaning of "unless," which is acquired by means of an ellipsis; e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>, it turns not back thither, unless it has watered the earth (it returns back not before then, not unless this is done). This "unless" is, however, used like the Lat. nisi, also without the conditioning clause following, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>, hic locus non est nisi domus Dei. And hence the expression &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, after the negation going before, acquires the meaning of "but," e.g., 17b: let not thy heart be covetous after sinners, for thou canst always be zealous for the fear of God, i.e., much rather for this, but for this. This pleonasm of &#1488;&#1501; sometimes occurs where &#1499;&#1497; is not used confirmatively, but affirmatively: the "certainly if" forms the transition, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-6.htm">1 Kings 20:6</a> (vid., Keil's Comm. l.c.), whose "if" is not seldom omitted, so that &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; has only the meaning of an affirmative "certainly," not "truly no," which it may also have, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-34.htm">1 Samuel 25:34</a>, but "truly yes." Thus &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501; is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-7.htm">Judges 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a> (where &#1488;&#1501; is omitted by the Ker&#305;&#770;); <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-20.htm">2 Kings 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-14.htm">Jeremiah 51:14</a>; and thus it is also meant here, 18a, notwithstanding that &#1499;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, in its more usual signification, "besides only, but, nisi," precedes, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a>, cf. 5. The objection by Hitzig, that with this explanation: "certainly there is a future," <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-18.htm">Proverbs 23:18</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-17.htm">Proverbs 23:17</a> are at variance, falls to the ground, if one reflects on the Heb. idiom, in which the affirmative signification of &#1499;&#1497; is interpenetrated by the confirmative. &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; used thus pregnantly, as here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-14.htm">Proverbs 24:14</a>), is the glorious final issue; the word in itself designates the end into which human life issues (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-37.htm">Psalm 37:37</a>.); here, the end crowning the preceding course. Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>) in this sense connects &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1514;&#1511;&#1493;&#1492; [end and expectation]. And what is here denied of the &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;&#1492;, the hope (not as certain Jewish interpreters dream, the thread of life) of him who zealously strives after the fear of God, is affirmed, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-38.htm">Psalm 37:38</a>, of the godless: the latter have no continuance, but the former have such as is the fulfilling of his hope. </body></html>
