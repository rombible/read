Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or (with the Septuagint and Vulgate), Lest she should ponder (or "She ponders not") the way of life, her paths move to and fro (unsteady as an earthquake); she knows not.

The way of the mind, walk, and conversation; keep at the greatest distance from her; neither come where she is, nor look at her, nor converse with her; shun her, as one would the pest or a loathsome carcass; go a good way about rather than come near her, or be within sight of her, or so as to be in any danger of being ensnared by her; <p>and come not nigh the door of her house; not only not enter her chamber, but go not to her house; no, not over the threshold of the door, nor near the door; but avoid her house, as one would a house that has the plague in it. Men should not go in the way of temptation, trusting to their own strength; they may be entangled and overcome before they are aware; is good to keep out of the way of it. And as it becomes the children of Wisdom to wait at her gates, and at the posts of her door, to gain knowledge and understanding of divine things; so they should not go within the doors of false teachers, nor near them, nor admit them within theirs. It is a complaint against the church at Thyatira, that she suffered the woman Jezebel, the Romish harlot, to teach and seduce the servants of Christ, or connived at their attendance on her, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remove thy way far from her.</span> In other words, this is the same as St. Paul counsels, "Flee fornication" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-14.htm">1 Corinthians 6:14</a>). <span class="accented">From her</span> (<span class="accented">mealeyah</span>; <span class="accented">desuper ea</span>).

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2</a> the inf. of the object is continued in the finitum, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-8.htm">Proverbs 2:8</a>. &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (vid., on its etymon under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-4.htm">Proverbs 1:4</a>) are plans, projects, designs, for the most part in a bad sense, intrigues and artifices (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-8.htm">Proverbs 24:8</a>), but also used of well-considered resolutions toward what is good, and hence of the purposes of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-20.htm">Jeremiah 23:20</a>. This noble sense of the word &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, with its plur., is peculiar to the introductory portion (chap. 1-9) of the Book of Proverbs. The plur. means here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-12.htm">Proverbs 8:12</a> (placing itself with &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, vid., p. 68) the reflection and deliberation which is the presupposition of well-considered action, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; is thus not otherwise than at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8</a>, and everywhere so meant, where it has that which is obligatory as its object: the youth is summoned to careful observation and persevering exemplification of the quidquid agas, prudenter agas et respice finem.
