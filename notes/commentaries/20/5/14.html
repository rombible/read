Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived.

Scarce a sin but he was guilty of; contempt of private and public instructions, the instructions of parents and ministers of the Gospel, and following lewd women, commonly lead to the commission of all other sins, even the most atrocious. Some understand this, not of the evil of sin, but of the evil of punishment; and that the sense is, that there is scarce any calamity, distress, or misery, that a man can be in, but his profaneness and lewdness had brought him into; and he was just upon the brink of hell itself: and so Jarchi paraphrases it, <p>"there was but a step between me and hell.'' <p>Aben Ezra observes, that the past is put for the future, "I shall be"; and then the meaning is, in a little or in a short time I shall be in complete misery; and so they are the words of one under consciousness of sin, despairing of mercy; <p>in the midst of the congregation and the assembly; that is, either be despised and neglected the instructions which were given in a public manner; or he committed all the evil he did openly; not only in company with wicked men, which he frequented, but even in the presence and before the people of God; yea, before the civil magistrates, the great sanhedrim, which is sometimes designed by the last word here used: or when he was in the house of God, attending public worship, his eyes were full of adultery, and his heart of impure lusts; and neither place, service, nor people of God, where he was, commanded any awe and reverence in him, nor in the least restrained his unclean thoughts and wanton desires; and which is mentioned as an aggravation of guilt. Or else the sense is, that his calamities and miseries were as public as his crimes; he was made a public example of, and all the people were witnesses of it; which served to spread his infamy, and make his punishment the more intolerable: both the sins and punishment of those that commit fornication with the whore of Rome will be public and manifest, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-5.htm">Revelation 18:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> assembly.</span><p>(g) Although I was faithfully instructed in the truth, yet I almost fell to utter shame and destruction nonetheless, by good bringing up in the assembly of the godly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">I was almost in all evil</span>] Ewald and other commentators take this to mean, I had a narrow escape from incurring the extreme penalty which the law of Moses prescribes for this sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm" title="And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 20:10</a>): I almost, or well nigh, was convicted and stoned to death in public, “in the midst of the congregation and the assembly.” But the writer, if this were his meaning, has hardly chosen a happy phrase in which to convey it to us. It is better to understand the clause as added to lend aggravation to the sin, rather than to the punishment or danger. The words “congregation” and “assembly,” sometimes with the addition, “of Israel,” “of Jehovah,” “of God” (see for examples which abound in the Pentateuch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-3.htm" title="And the children of Israel said to them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for you have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.">Exodus 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-15.htm" title="And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.">Leviticus 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-30.htm" title="And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.">Deuteronomy 31:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-3.htm" title="And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, You take too much on you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: why then lift you up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?">Numbers 16:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm" title="Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-1.htm" title="On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;">Nehemiah 13:1</a>), had come to be the common designation of Israel, as the people of Jehovah, the holy nation, separated from the abominations of the heathen. The Greek equivalents for these words (<span class="greekheb">ἐν μέσῳ ἐκκλησίας καὶ συναγωγῆς</span> LXX.) became naturally the titles of the Church under its Jewish and Christian aspects. To sin then “in the midst of the congregation and assembly” was to sin against light and knowledge, and to disgrace the body of which the sinner was a member. Somewhat similarly we hear it said, as an aggravation of crime or immorality, that it has been done “in a Christian country.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> such was my shamelessness that there was scarcely any wickedness which I did not commit, unrestrained even by the presence of the congregation and assembly. The fact which the ruined youth laments is the extent and audacity of his sins. It is not that he accuses himself of hypocrisy in religion (Delitzsch), but he adds another clement in his career of vice. He has disregarded the warnings and reproofs of his teachers and friends; but more, the presence of the congregation of God's people, a silent but not a less impressive protest, had no restraining effect upon him. The words, "the congregation and assembly" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">kahal v'edah</span>), seem to be used to heighten the conception, rather than to express two distinct and separate ideas, since we find them both used interchangeably to designate the congregation of the Israelites. The radical conception of <span class="accented">kahal</span> ("congregation") is the same as that of the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> and Vulgate <span class="accented">ecclesia</span>, viz. the congregation looked upon from the point of its being called together, <span class="accented">kahal</span> being derived from <span class="accented">kahal</span>, which in hiph. is equivalent to "to call together," while that of <span class="accented">edah</span> is the congregation looked at from the point of its having assembled <span class="accented">edah</span> being derived from <span class="accented">yaad</span>, in niph. equivalent to "to come together." The latter will therefore stand for any assembly of people specially convened or coming together for some definite object, like the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;</span> and the Vulgate <span class="accented">synagoga</span>. The term <span class="accented">edah</span> is, however, used in a technical sense as signifying the <span class="accented">seventy elders</span>, or senators, who judged the people (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>). Rabbi Salomon so explains <span class="accented">haedah</span> as "the congregation," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/20-6.htm">Joshua 20:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>. Other explanations, however, have been given of these words. Zockler takes <span class="accented">kahal</span> as the convened council of elders acting as judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-4.htm">Deuteronomy 33:4, 5</a>), and <span class="accented">edah</span> as the concourse (<span class="accented">coetus</span>) of the people executing the condemning sentence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-15.htm">Numbers 15:15</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-7.htm">Psalm 7:7</a>), and renders, "Well nigh had I fallen into utter destruction in the midst of the assembly and the congregation." Fleischer, Vatablus, and Bayne take much the same view, looking upon <span class="accented">ra</span> ("evil," Authorized Version) as "punishment," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the evil which follows as a consequence of sin - a usage supported by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-18.htm">2 Samuel 16:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-19.htm">Exodus 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-23.htm">1 Chronicles 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-6.htm">Psalm 10:6</a> - rather than as evil <span class="accented">per se, i.e.</span> that which is morally bad, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-22.htm">Exodus 32:22</a>. Aben Ezra considers that the <span class="accented">perfect</span> is used for the <span class="accented">future</span>; "In a little time I shall be involved in all evil;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> punishment, which is looked forward to prospectively. For "almost" (<span class="accented">ki</span>-<span class="accented">mat</span>, equivalent to "within a little," "almost," "nearly"), see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-10.htm">Genesis 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-87.htm">Psalm 119:87</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-8.htm">Proverbs 5:8</a>, one must think on such as make a gain of their impurity. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, Schultens remarks, with reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a>, crebrum in rescisso omni commercio: &#1502;&#1503; denotes the departure, and &#1506;&#1500; the nearness, from which one must remove himself to a distance.
