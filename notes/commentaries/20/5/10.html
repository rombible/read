Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Strangers - The whole gang of those into whose hands the slave of lust yields himself.

Jarchi interprets it of the prophets of Baal, that exact money by their falsehoods; it may well enough be applied to the fornicating merchants of Rome, who wax rich through the abundance of her delicacies and adulteries, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-3.htm">Revelation 18:3</a>; persons, strangers indeed to God and Christ, and all true religion; <p>and thy labours be in the house of a stranger; that is, wealth gotten by hard labour, with toil and sweat, grief and trouble, as the word used (q) signifies; and yet, after all, not enjoyed by himself and his lawful wife and children, but by the strange woman and her accomplices, and spent in maintaining whores, bawds, and bastards; hence the fable of the Harpies eating and spoiling the victuals of Phineus, who were no other than harlots that consumed his substance (r): and sometimes they are carried into a strange country, and possessed by foreigners. These are the wretched effects and miserable consequences of adultery, and therefore by all means to be shunned and avoided.

The suggestion of Ewald and others that these verses (9, 10) point to the commutation of the capital sentence into one of slavery, whether voluntarily undergone by the adulterer to escape death, or exacted by the injured husband, and that thus the guilty man’s years would be given unto the cruel, and his labours would be in the house of an alien, is not supported by any proof that such commutation was practised. On the contrary the holy law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm" title="If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shall you put away evil from Israel.">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>) appears to nave been strictly maintained (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-38.htm" title="And I will judge you, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give you blood in fury and jealousy.">Ezekiel 16:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-40.htm" title="They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.">Ezekiel 16:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm" title="Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you?">John 8:5</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/6-34.htm" title="For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance....">Proverbs 6:34-35</a> we are expressly told that the husband will accept no compensation. While escaping, probably because undetected, the penalty of death, the victim of lust would like the prodigal son “devour his living with harlots,” and so come to be in want and misery.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Another temporal consequence of, and deterrent against, a life of profligacy. <span class="cmt_word">Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger</span>. The margin reads, "thy strength" for "thy wealth," but the text properly renders the original <span class="accented">koakh</span>, which means "substance," "wealth," "riches" - the youth's possessions in money and property (Delitzsch). The primary meaning of the word is "strength" or "might," as appears from the verb <span class="accented">kakhakh</span>, "to exert one's self," from which it is derived, but the parallel <span class="accented">atsabeyka</span>, "thy toils," rendered "thy labours," determines its use in the secondary sense here. Compare the similar passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-9.htm">Hosea 7:9</a>, "Strangers have devoured his strength [<span class="accented">koakh, i.e.</span> ' his possessions'], and he knoweth it not" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-22.htm">Job 6:22</a>). <span class="accented">Koakh</span> is the concrete product resulting from the abstract strength or ability when brought into action. <span class="accented">Thy labours</span> (<span class="accented">atsabeyka</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thy toils, the product of laborious toil, that which you have gotten by the labour of your hands, and earned with the sweat of your brow. Fleischer compares the Italian <span class="accented">i miri sudori</span>, and the French <span class="accented">mes sueurs.</span> The singular <span class="accented">etsev</span> signifies "heavy toilsome labour," and the plural (<span class="accented">atsavim</span>, "labours," things done with toil, and so the idea passes to the resultant of the labour. Compare the very similar expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-2.htm">Psalm 127:2</a>, <span class="accented">lekhem naatsavim</span>, equivalent to "bread obtained by toilsome labour;" Authorized Version, "the bread of sorrows." The Authorized Version properly supplies the verb "be" against those (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Holden <span class="accented">et alli</span>) who join on "thy labours" to the previous verb "be filled," as an accusative, and render, "and with thy labours in the house of a stranger." So also the LXX. and the Vulgate, "and thy labours come" (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, LXX.) or "be" (<span class="accented">sint</span>, Vulgate) "to the house of strangers" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) or, "in a strange house" (<span class="accented">in aliena domo</span>). In the latter case the Vulgate is wrong, as <span class="accented">nok'ri</span> in the phrase <span class="accented">beyth nok'ri</span> is always personal (Delitzsch), and should be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, "in the house of a stranger." The meaning of the verse is that a life of impurity transfers the profligate's substance, his wealth and possessions, to others, who will be satiated at his expense, and, being strangers, are indifferent to his ruin. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-4.htm">Proverbs 5:4</a> the reverse of the sweet and smooth external is placed opposite to the attraction of the seducer, by whose influence the inconsiderate permits himself to be carried away: her end, i.e., the last that is experienced of her, the final consequence of intercourse with her (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-32.htm">Proverbs 23:32</a>), is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. The O.T. language regards bitterness and poison as related both in meaning and in reality; the word &#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; (Aq. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  equals  wormwood) means in Arab. the curse. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is translated by Jerome after the lxx, gladius biceps; but &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; means double-edged, and &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1508;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-16.htm">Judges 3:16</a>) means a doubled-edged sword. Here the plur. will thus poetically strengthen the meaning, like &#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, that which devours, as if it had three or four edges (Fl.). The end in which the disguised seduction terminates is bitter as the bitterest, and cutting as that which cuts the most: self-condemnation and a feeling of divine anger, anguish of heart, and destructive judgment. The feet of the adulteress go downward to death. In Hebr. this descendentes ad mortem is expressed by the genitive of connection; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is the genitive, as in &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>; elsewhere the author uses &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-27.htm">Proverbs 7:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>. Death, &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (so named from the stretching of the corpse after the stiffness of death), denotes the condition of departure from this side as a punishment, with which is associated the idea of divine wrath. In &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; (sinking, abyss, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, R. &#1513;&#1500;, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>), lie the ideas of the grave as a place of corruption, and of the under-world as the place of incorporeal shadow-life. Her steps hold fast to Hades is equivalent to, they strive after Hades and go straight to it; similar to this is the Arab. expression, hdha&#770; a&#770;ldrb ya&#770;khdh a&#770;ly a&#770;lbld: this way leads straight forward to the town (Fl.).</body></html>
