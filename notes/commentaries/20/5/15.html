The same figure is employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-15.htm" title="A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.">Song of Solomon 4:15</a>, where a wife is compared to “a fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.” In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-13.htm" title="For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.">Jeremiah 2:13</a> God compares Himself to a “fountain of living waters,” and complains that Israel had deserted Him, and hewed out for themselves “broken cisterns that can hold no water.” This passage in Proverbs has in like manner often been interpreted as an exhortation to drink deeply from the living waters of the Holy Spirit given in the Word and Sacraments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>).—For ref. see Bishop Wordsworth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/proverbs/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-15.htm" title="Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.">Proverbs 5:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Drink waters out of thine own cistern </span>— “The allegory here begun is carried on through several verses. It has been differently understood; but the interpretation which seems most generally followed, is that of those who conceive that the wise man here subjoins a commendation of matrimony, and the chaste preservation of the marriage- bed, for the propagation of a legitimate offspring, to his dehortation from illegitimate embraces, and stolen waters; and Schultens observes, that no figure is more elegant or more common among the easterns than this.” — Dodd. Bishop Patrick’s paraphrase on the verse is, “Marry; and in a wife of thy own, enjoy the pleasures thou desirest, and be content with them alone; innocent, chaste, and pure pleasures; as much different from the other, as the clear waters of a wholesome fountain are from those of a dirty lake or puddle.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:15-23 Lawful marriage is a means God has appointed to keep from these destructive vices. But we are not properly united, except as we attend to God's word, seeking his direction and blessing, and acting with affection. Ever remember, that though secret sins may escape the eyes of our fellow-creatures, yet a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, who not only sees, but ponders all his goings. Those who are so foolish as to choose the way of sin, are justly left of God to themselves, to go on in the way to destruction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The teacher seeks to counteract the evils of mere sensual passion chiefly by setting forth the true blessedness of which it is the counterfeit. The true wife is as a fountain of refreshment, where the weary soul may quench its thirst. Even the joy which is of the senses appears, as in the Song of Solomon, purified and stainless (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-19.htm">Proverbs 5:19</a> marginal reference). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-20. By figures, in which well, cistern, and fountain [Pr 5:15, 18] represent the wife, and rivers of waters [Pr 5:16] the children, men are exhorted to constancy and satisfaction in lawful conjugal enjoyments. In Pr 5:16, fountains (in the plural) rather denote the produce or waters of a spring, literally, "what is from a spring," and corresponds with "rivers of waters."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This metaphor contained here, and <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/5-16.htm" title="Let your fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets....">Proverbs 5:16-18</a></span>, is to be understood either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of the free and lawful use of a man’s estate, both for his own comfort, and for the good of others. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Of the honest use of matrimony, as the proper remedy against these filthy practices. This best suits with the whole context, both foregoing and following; and thus it is explained in the end of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-18.htm" title="Let your fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of your youth.">Proverbs 5:18</a></span>. So the sense is, Content thyself with those delights which God alloweth thee, with the sober use of the marriage bed. Why shouldst thou ramble hither and thither, trespassing against God and men, to steal their waters, which thou mightest freely take out of thine own cistern or well. The ground of the metaphor is this, that waters were scarce and precious in those countries, and therefore men used to make cisterns and wells for their own private use. And the same metaphor of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">waters, </span> and of <span class="ital">a pit</span>, or <span class="ital">well</span>, is applied to things of this nature elsewhere, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-27.htm" title="For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.">Proverbs 23:27</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm" title="Hear you this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.">Isaiah 48:1</a> 51:1</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Drink waters out of thine own cistern,.... Arguments being used to dissuade from conversation with an adulterous woman, taken from the disgrace, diseases, poverty, and distress of mind on reflection, it brings a man to; the wise man proceeds to direct to marriage, as a proper antidote against it: take a wife and cleave to her, and enjoy all the pleasures and comforts of a marriage state. As every man formerly had his own cistern for the reception of water for his own use, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a>; so every man should have his own wife, and but one: and as drinking water quenches thirst, and allays heat; so the lawful enjoyments of the marriage bed quench the thirst of appetite, and allay the heat of lust; for which reason the apostle advises men to marry and not burn, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-9.htm">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>; and a man that is married should be content with his own wife, and not steal waters out of another cistern. The allusion may be to a law, which, Clemens of Alexandria (t) says, Plato had from the Hebrews; which enjoined husbandmen not to take water from others to water their lands, till they themselves had dug into the earth, called virgin earth, and found it dry and without water; <p>and running waters out of thine own well; the pure, chaste, and innocent pleasures of the marriage state, are as different from the embraces of an harlot, who is compared to a deep ditch and a narrow pit, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27</a>; as clear running waters of a well or fountain from the dirty waters of a filthy puddle; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17</a>. Some interpret these words, and what follows, of persons enjoying with contentment the good things of life they have for the support of themselves and families; and of a liberal communication of them to the relief of proper objects; but not to spend their substance on harlots. Jarchi understands by the "cistern", the law of Moses: but it may be better applied to the Scriptures in general, from whence all sound doctrine flows, to the comfort and refreshment of the souls of men; and from whence all doctrine ought to be fetched, and not elsewhere. <p>(t) Stromat. l. 1. p. 274. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Drink waters out of <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</span><p>(h) He teaches us sobriety exhorting us to live of our own labours and to be beneficial to the godly who want.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15–19</span>. The remedy against sin is to be found in the holy estate which God has ordained. “The resemblance between the two Books (the Song of Solomon and the Book of Proverbs) in their treatment of this subject is singularly striking.” <span class="ital">Speaker’s Comm., ad loc</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-19.</span> - <span class="accented">Commendation of the chaste intercourse of marriage.</span> In this section the teacher passes from admonitory warnings against unchastity to the commendation of conjugal fidelity and pure love. The allegorical exposition of this passage, current at the period of the Revision of the Authorized Version in 1612, as referring to liberality, is not <span class="accented">ad rem</span>. Such an idea had no place certainly in the teacher's mind, nor is it appropriate to the context, the scope of which is, as we have seen, to warn youth against indulgence in illicit pleasures, by pointing out the terrible consequences which follow, and to indicate, on the other hand, in what direction the satisfaction of natural wants is to be obtained, that so, the heart and conscience being kept pure, sin and evil may be avoided. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Drink waters out of thine own cistern,</span> etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the wife of your own choice, or in the legitimate sphere of marriage, seek the satisfaction of your natural impulses. The pure, innocent, and chaste nature of such pleasures is appropriately compared with the pure and wholesome waters of the cistern and the wellspring. The "drinking" carries with it the satisfying of a natural want. Agreeably with oriental and scriptural usage, "the wife" is compared with a "cistern" and "well." Thus in the Song of Solomon the "bride" is called a spring shut up, a fountain sealed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>). Sarah is spoken of under exactly the same figure that is used here, viz. the <span class="accented">bor</span>, or "cistern," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a>. The figure was not confined to women, however, as we find Judah alluded to as "waters" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>,  and Jacob or Israel so appearing in the prophecy of Balaam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-7.htm">Numbers 24:7</a>). The people are spoken of by David as they that are "of the fountain of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a>). A similar imagery is employed in the New Testament of the wife. The apostles St. Paul and St. Peter both speak of her as "the vessel (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). The forms of the original, <span class="accented">b'or</span> and <span class="accented">b'er</span>, standing respectively for "cistern" and "well," indicate a common derivation from <span class="accented">baar</span>, "to dig." But <span class="accented">bor</span> is an artificially constructed reservoir or cistern, equivalent to the Vulgate <span class="accented">cisterna</span>, and LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, while <span class="accented">b'er</span> is the natural spring of water, equivalent to the Vulgate <span class="accented">putens.</span> So Aben Ezra, who says, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2</a>:36, "<span class="accented">Bor</span> is that which catches the rain, while <span class="accented">b'er</span> is that from within which the water wells up." This explanation, however, does not entirely cover the terms as used here. The "waters" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">mayim</span>) may be the pure water conveyed into the cistern, and not simply the water which is caught in its descent born heaven. The parallel term, "running waters" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">noz'lim</span>), describes the flowing limpid stream fit, like the other, for drinking purposes. A similar use of the terms is made in the <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-15.htm">Song of Solomon 4:15</a>, "a well of living waters (<span class="accented">b'er mayim khayyim</span>) and streams (<span class="accented">v'noz'lim</span>) from Lebanon." It may be remarked that the allusion to the wife, under the figures employed, enhances her value. It indicates the high estimation in which she is to be held, since the "cistern" or "well" was one of the most valuable possessions and adjuncts of an Eastern house. The teaching of the passage, in its bearing on the subject of marriage, coincides with that which is subsequently put forward by St. Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-9.htm">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-8.htm">Proverbs 5:8</a>, one must think on such as make a gain of their impurity. &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, Schultens remarks, with reference to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a>, crebrum in rescisso omni commercio: &#1502;&#1503; denotes the departure, and &#1506;&#1500; the nearness, from which one must remove himself to a distance. Regarding &#1492;&#1493;&#1491; gn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-9.htm">Proverbs 5:9</a>), which primarily, like our Pracht (bracht from brechen  equals  to break) pomp, magnificence, appears to mean fulness of sound, and then fulness of splendour, see under <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>; here there is a reference to the freshness or the bloom of youth, as well as the years, against the sacrifice of which the warning is addressed - in a pregnant sense they are the fairest years, the years of youthful fulness of strength.

It is the adj. relat. of &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512; after the form &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1489;, which is formed not from &#1488;&#1498; &#1494;&#1512;, but from an unknown verb &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;. The ancients referred it to death and the devil; but the &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; belongs to the covetous society, which impels ever anew to sin, which is their profit, him who has once fallen into it, and thus brings bodily ruin upon him; they are the people who stand far aloof from this their sacrifice, and among them are barbarous, rude, inexorably cruel monsters (Unmenschen) (Graecus Venetus, &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#837;), who rest not till their victim is laid prostrate on the ground and ruined both bodily and financially.</body></html>
