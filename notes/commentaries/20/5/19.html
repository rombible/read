That is, the wife of youth; let her always appear to thee as amiable and lovely as these creatures are; or let her be loved by thee as these are by princes and great men (w), who used to keep them tame, keep them clean, wash, comb them, and adorn them, and play with them; or rather, as these creatures are loving to their mates, let thy love be single, chaste, pure, and fervent, as theirs; see Sol 2:9. The pure church of Christ is very different from the apostate church of Rome; the one is compared to a loving and lovely creature, innocent and chaste; the other to a cruel and savage beast, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>; <p>let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; even as it were to be inebriated therewith, and so as not to seek out elsewhere to strange women for satisfaction; see Sol 1:13.

Let her be as] These words, which are not in the Hebrew, are not wanted. Read “A loving hind &c.” The imagery again, which is thoroughly Oriental, reappears in the Song of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-9.htm" title="Then shall you understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yes, every good path.">Proverbs 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm" title="Which forsakes the guide of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God.">Proverbs 2:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-3.htm" title="Bind them on your fingers, write them on the table of your heart.">Proverbs 7:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-14.htm" title="Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.">Proverbs 8:14</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe.</span> The words in italics do not occur in the original. The expression, "the loving hind and pleasant roe," is, therefore, to be attached to the preceding verse, as carrying on the sense and as descriptive of the grace and fascinating charms of the young wife. As combining these attributes, she is to be the object of thy love and devotion,the one in whom thine affections are to find the fulfilment of their desires. Love and grace are her possessions. The <span class="accented">loving hind</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ayyeleth ahavim</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the hind of loves</span>, which may be understood, as in the Authorized Version, as pointing to the fondness of this animal for its young, or as descriptive of its beauty and the extreme gracefulness of its form. In this sense the phrase may be rendered, "the lovely hind." The <span class="accented">ayyeleth</span>, or <span class="accented">ayyalah</span>, feminine of <span class="accented">ayyal</span>, "stag," or "hart," was in all probability the gazelle, <span class="accented">Pleasant roe</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">yhaalath khen</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the ibex of grace.</span> The particular expression only occurs here in the Bible. <span class="accented">The yaalath is the</span> feminine of <span class="accented">yaal</span>, "the ibex" or "mountain goat" according to Bochart, or the "chamois" according to Gesenius. It does not appear that it is so much "the pleasantness" or amiability of this animal which is here alluded to as its gracefulness of form. As terms of endearment, the words entered largely into the erotic poetry of the East. Thus in the <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-5.htm">Song of Solomon 4:5</a> the bride likens her beloved to "a roe or young hart" (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4.htm">Song of Solomon 4</a>:17 and Song 8:14). while numerous examples might be quoted from the Arabian and Persian poets. They were also employed sometimes as names for women. Compare the superscription of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>, <span class="accented">Ayyeleth hash-shakar</span>, "Upon the hind of the dawn." <span class="cmt_word">Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times.</span> The love of the wife is to refresh and fully satisfy the husband. The word <span class="accented">dadeyah</span>, "her breasts," only occurs here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-3.htm">Ezekiel 23:3, 8, 21</a>, and is equivalent to <span class="accented">dodeyah</span>, "her love." The marginal reading, "water thee," serves to bring out the literal meaning of the <span class="accented">y'ravvuka</span>, derived from <span class="accented">ravah</span>, in kal, "to drink largely," "to be satisfied with drink," but misses the emphatic force of the piel, "to be fully satisfied or satiated." This is expressed very forcibly in the Vulgate rendering, "Let her breasts inebriate thee (<span class="accented">indebrient te</span>)," which represents the strong influence which the attractions of the wife are to maintain. The LXX., on the other hand, avoiding the rather sensual colouring of the language, substitutes, "May she thine own lead thee, and be with thee always." <span class="cmt_word">And be thou ravished always with her love</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let it intoxicate thee. The teacher, by a bold figure, describes the entire fascination which the husband is to allow the wife to exercise over him. The verb <span class="accented">shagah</span> is "to reel under the influence of wine," and is so used in the succeeding vers. 20 and 23, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>. The primary meaning, "to err from the way," scarcely applies here, and does not express the idea of the teacher, which is to describe "an intensity of love connected with the feeling of superabundant happiness" (Delitzsch). The Vulgate, <span class="accented">In amore ejus delectare jugiter</span>, "In her love delight thyself continually," and the LXX., "For in her love thou shalt be daily engaged," are mere paraphrases. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468; signifies to cleave to anything in hearing, as &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1489; is to do so in seeing; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1500; yet more closely corresponds with the classic &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, obedire, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-9.htm">Psalm 81:9</a>; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500; is the usual phrase for "hearken!"</body></html>
