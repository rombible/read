But we are not properly united, except as we attend to God's word, seeking his direction and blessing, and acting with affection. Ever remember, that though secret sins may escape the eyes of our fellow-creatures, yet a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, who not only sees, but ponders all his goings.

It may mean, however, that God makes man’s ways level, in the sense of making them lead swiftly and surely to their appointed end (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/5-22.htm" title="His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins....">Proverbs 5:22-23</a></span>). Others take it in contrast with the next verse: God makes a man’s ways level (right), but sin involves him in difficulties from which he cannot extricate himself. The derived sense <span class="bld">pondereth</span> (or, <span class="ital">weigheth carefully</span>, R.V. marg.) comes from holding the balances in weighing till the two scales are even, and so making level. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-4.htm" title="Does not he see my ways, and count all my steps?">Job 31:4</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord.</span> The obvious meaning here is that as "the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>), there is no possibility of any act of immorality escaping God's notice. The consciousness of this fact is to be the restraining motive, inasmuch as he who sees will also punish every transgression. The great truth acknowledged here is the omniscience of God, a truth which is borne witness to in almost identical language in Job: "For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-21.htm">Job 34:21</a>; cf. 24:23 and Job 31:4). So Hanani the seer says to Asa King of Judah, "For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>); and Jehovah says, in Jeremiah, "For mine eyes are upon all their ways, they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-17.htm">Jeremiah 16:17</a>; cf. 32:29); and again, in Hosea, "They are before my face" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-2.htm">Hosea 7:2</a>), and the same truth is re-echoed in the Epistle to the Hebrews, in all probability gathered from our passage, "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>)<span class="accented">. The ways of man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the conduct of any individual man or woman; <span class="accented">ish</span>, "man," being used generically. <span class="accented">Are before the eyes of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are an object on which Jehovah fixes his gaze and scrutiny. And he pondereth all his goings. The word "he pondereth" is in the original <span class="accented">m'phalles</span>, the piel participle <span class="accented">of philles</span>, piel of the unused kal, <span class="accented">palas</span>, and appears to be properly rendered in the Authorized Version. This verb, however, has various meanings: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to make level, or prepare, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a> and Proverbs 5:6; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to weigh, or consider accurately, in which sense it is used here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So Gesenius, Lee, Buxtorf, and Davidson. Jehovah not only sees, but weighs all that a man does, wheresoever he be, and will apportion rewards and punishments according to a man's actions (Patrick). The German commentators, Delitzsch and Zockler, however, look upon the word as indicating the overruling providence of God, just as the former part of the verse refers to his omniscience, and render, "he marketh out," in the sense that the Lord makes it possible for a man to walk in the way of uprightness and purity. There is nothing inherently objectionable in this view, since experience shows that the world is regulated by the Divine government, but it loses sight to some extent of the truth upon which the teacher appears to be insisting, which is that evil actions are visited with Divine retribution. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The commendation of true conjugal love in the form of an invitation to a participation in it, is now presented along with the warning against non-conjugal intercourse, heightened by a reference to its evil consequences.<p>15 Drink water from thine own cistern,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And flowing streams from thine own fountain.<p>16 Shall thy streams flow abroad,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water-brooks in the streets!<p>17 Let them belong to thyself alone,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not to strangers with thee.<p>One drinks water to quench his thirst; here drinking is a figure of the satisfaction of conjugal love, of which Paul says, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-9.htm">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>, &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b7;&#787;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and this comes into view here, in conformity with the prevailing character of the O.T., only as a created inborn natural impulse, without reference to the poisoning of it by sin, which also within the sphere of married life makes government, moderation, and restraint a duty. Warning against this degeneracy of the natural impulse to the &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; authorized within divinely prescribed limits, the apostle calls the wife of any one &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). So here the wife, who is his by covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>), is called "cistern" (&#1489;&#1493;&#1512;)<p>(Note: The lxx translate &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, i.e., &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; (vid., Lagarde).)<p>and "fountain" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;) of the husband to whom she is married. The figure corresponds to the sexual nature of the wife, the expression for which is &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1492;; but <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-1.htm">Isaiah 51:1</a> holds to the natural side of the figure, for according to it the wife is a pit, and the children are brought out of it into the light of day. Aben-Ezra on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-36.htm">Leviticus 11:36</a> rightly distinguishes between &#1489;&#1493;&#1512; and &#1489;&#1488;&#1512;: the former catches the rain, the latter wells out from within. In the former, as Rashi in Erubin ii. 4 remarks, there are &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, in the latter &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;. The post-biblical Hebrew observes this distinction less closely (vid., Kimchi's Book of Roots), but the biblical throughout; so far the Ker&#305;&#770;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-7.htm">Jeremiah 6:7</a>, rightly changes &#1489;&#1493;&#1512; into the form &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, corresponding to the Arab. byar. Therefore &#1489;&#1493;&#1512; is the cistern, for the making of which &#1495;&#1510;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, and &#1489;&#1488;&#1512; the well, for the formation of which &#1495;&#1508;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-30.htm">Genesis 21:30</a>, and &#1499;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-25.htm">Genesis 26:25</a>, are the respective words usually employed (vid., Malbim, Sifra 117b). The poet shows that he also is aware of this distinction, for he calls the water which one drinks from the &#1489;&#1493;&#1512; by the name &#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, but on the other hand that out of the &#1489;&#1488;&#1512; by the name &#1504;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, running waters, fluenta; by this we are at once reminded of Sol 4:15, cf. 12. The &#1489;&#1493;&#1512; offers only stagnant water (according to the Sohar, the &#1489;&#1493;&#1512; has no water of its own, but only that which is received into it), although coming down into it from above; but the &#1489;&#1488;&#1512; has living water, which wells up out of its interior (&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1498;, 15b, intentionally for the mere &#1502;&#1503;), and is fresh as the streams from Lebanon (&#1504;&#1494;&#1500;, properly labi, to run down, cf. &#1488;&#1494;&#1500;, placide ire, and generally ire; Arab. za&#770;l, loco cedere, desinere; Arab. zll, IV, to cause to glide back, deglutire, of the gourmand). What a valuable possession a well of water is for nomads the history of the patriarchs makes evident, and a cistern is one of the most valuable possessions belonging to every well-furnished house. The figure of the cistern is here surpassed by that of the fountain, but both refer to the seeking and finding satisfaction (cf. the opposite passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27</a>) with the wife, and that, as the expressive possessive suffixes denote, with his legitimate wife.</body></html>
