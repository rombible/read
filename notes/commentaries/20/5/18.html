Thy wife; make her happy by keeping to her and from others; by behaving in a loving, affable, and respectful manner to her; by living comfortably with her, and providing well for her and her children: or reckon her a happiness, a blessing that God has bestowed; or <p>"thy fountain shall be blessed,'' <p>as the Targum; that is, with a numerous offspring, which was always reckoned a blessedness, and was generally the happiness of virtuous women, when harlots were barren; <p>and rejoice with the wife of thy youth; taken to be a wife in youth, and lived with ever since; do not despise her, nor divorce her, even in old age, but delight in her company now as ever; carry it not morosely and churlishly to her, but express a joy and pleasure in her; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>. Jarchi interprets this of the law learned in youth; but it might be much better interpreted of the pure apostolic church of Christ, "the beulah", to whom her sons are married, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>; to whom they should cleave with delight and pleasure, and not follow the antichristian harlot. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let thy <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> youth.</span><p>(k) Your children who will come from you in great abundance showing that God blesses marriage and curses whoredom.<p>(l) Who you married in your youth.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth</span>. The employment of the ordinary term "wife" in the second hemistich shows in what sense the figure which is used has to be understood. The terms "fountain" and "wife" denote the same person. The wife is here called "thy fountain" (Hebrew,  <span class="accented">m'kor'ka</span>), just as she has been previously "thine own cistern" (<span class="accented">b'or</span>) and "thine own well" (<span class="accented">b'er</span>) in ver. 15. The Hebrew <span class="accented">makor</span>, "fountain," is derived from the root <span class="accented">kur</span>, "to dig." The figure seems to determine that the blessing here spoken of consists in the with being a fruitful mother of children; and hence the phrase means, "Let thy with be blessed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rendered happy in being the mother of thy children. This is quite consistent with the Hebrew mode of thought. Every Israelitish wife regarded herself, and was regarded by ethers as "blessed," if she bore children, and unhappy if the reverse were the case. <span class="accented">Blessed</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">baruk</span> (Vulgate, <span class="accented">benedicta</span>), is the kal participle passive of <span class="accented">barak</span>, "to bless." Instead of this, the LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "Let thy fountain be thine own" - a variation which in no sense conveys the meaning of the original. <span class="accented">And rejoice with</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rejoice in</span>, the wife being regarded as the sphere within which the husband is to find his pleasure and joy. Umbreit explains, "Let thy wife be extolled." The same construction of the imperative <span class="accented">s'makh</span>, from <span class="accented">samakh</span>," to be glad, or joyful," with <span class="accented">min</span>, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-19.htm">Judges 9:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14</a>, etc. The Authorized rendering is, however, favoured by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">laetare cum</span>, and the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> Compare the exhortation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>, "Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest." <span class="accented">The wife of thy youth</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ishshah n'ureyka</span>) may mean either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the wife to whom thou hast given the fair bloom of thy youth (Umbreit); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the wife chosen in thy youth (Delitzsch); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> thy youthful wife. The former seems the more probable meaning. Compare the expression, "companion of thy youth," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-17.htm">Proverbs 2:17</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The poet now tells those whom he warns to hear how the voluptuary, looking back on his life-course, passes sentence against himself.<p>12 And thou sayest, "Why have I then hated correction,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my heart despised instruction!<p>13 And I have not listened to the voice of my teachers,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor lent mine ear to my instructors?<p>14 I had almost fallen into every vice<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of the assembly and the congregation!"<p>The question 12a (here more an exclamation than a question) is the combination of two: How has it become possible for me?
