Some, by the adulterous woman, here understand idolatry, false doctrine, which tends to lead astray men's minds and manners; but the direct view is to warn against seventh-commandment sins. Often these have been, and still are, Satan's method of drawing men from the worship of God into false religion. Consider how fatal the consequences; how bitter the fruit! Take it any way, it wounds. It leads to the torments of hell. The direct tendency of this sin is to the destruction of body and soul. We must carefully avoid every thing which may be a step towards it. Those who would be kept from harm, must keep out of harm's way. If we thrust ourselves into temptation we mock God when we pray, Lead us not into temptation. How many mischiefs attend this sin! It blasts the reputation; it wastes time; it ruins the estate; it is destructive to health; it will fill the mind with horror. Though thou art merry now, yet sooner or later it will bring sorrow. The convinced sinner reproaches himself, and makes no excuse for his folly. By the frequent acts of sin, the habits of it become rooted and confirmed. By a miracle of mercy true repentance may prevent the dreadful consequences of such sins; but this is not often; far more die as they have lived. What can express the case of the self-ruined sinner in the eternal world, enduring the remorse of his conscience!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yet one more curse is attendant on impurity.

This mourning is too late, and not so much on account of the evil of sin as the evil that comes by it; it is when the man could have no pleasure from it and in it; when he has not only lost his substance by it, but his health also, the loss of both which must be very distressing: it is at the end of life, in his last days; in his old age, as the Syriac version, when he can no longer pursue his unclean practices; <p>when thy flesh and thy body are consumed; either in the time of old age and through it, as Gersom; or rather by diseases which the sin of uncleanness brings upon persons, which affixes the several parts of it; the brain, the blood, the liver, the back, and loins, and reins; and even all the parts of it, expressed by flesh and body.

It is not the plaintive wailing or the subdued grief of heart which is signified, but the loud wail of lamentation, the groaning indicative of intense mental suffering called forth by the remembrance of past folly, and which sees no remedy in the future. The verb <span class="accented">naham</span> occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-15.htm">Proverbs 28:15</a>, where it is used of the roaring of the lion, and the cognate noun <span class="accented">naham</span> is met with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a> and Proverbs 20:2 in the same sense. By Ezekiel it is used of the groaning of the people of Jerusalem when they shall see their sanctuary profaned, their sons and their daughters fall by the sword, and their city destroyed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>). Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-29.htm">Isaiah 5:29, 30</a>) applies it to the <span class="accented">roaring</span> of the sea. The Vulgate reproduces the idea in <span class="accented">gemas</span>, equivalent to "and thou groan." The LXX. rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, "and thou shelf repent," arising from the adoption of a different pointing, <span class="accented">nikhamta</span>, from the niph. <span class="accented">nikham</span>, "to repent," for <span class="accented">nahamta</span>, to some extent expresses the sense. <span class="accented">At the last</span>; literally, <span class="accented">at thine end</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when thou art ruined, or, as the teacher explains, <span class="accented">when thy flesh and thy body are consumed.</span> The expression, "thy flesh and thy body," here stands for the whole body, the body in its totality, not the body and the soul, which would be different. Of these two words "the flesh" (<span class="accented">basar</span>) rather denotes the flesh in its strict sense as such (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-31.htm">Job 31:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/33-21.htm">Job 33:21</a>), while "body" (<span class="accented">sh'er</span>) is the flesh adhering to the bones. Gesenlus regards them as synonymous terms, stating, however, that <span class="accented">sh'er</span> is the more poetical as to use. The word <span class="accented">basar</span> is used to denote the whole body in ch. 14:30. It is clear that, by the use of these two terms here, the teacher is following a peculiarity observable elsewhere in the Proverbs, of combining two terms to express, and so to give force to, one idea. The expression describes "the utter destruction of the libertine" (Umbreit). This destruction, as further involving the ruin of the soul, is described in ch. 6:32, "Whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding; he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul (<span class="accented">nephesh</span>)" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22, 23</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-4.htm">Proverbs 5:4</a> the reverse of the sweet and smooth external is placed opposite to the attraction of the seducer, by whose influence the inconsiderate permits himself to be carried away: her end, i.e., the last that is experienced of her, the final consequence of intercourse with her (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-32.htm">Proverbs 23:32</a>), is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. The O.T. language regards bitterness and poison as related both in meaning and in reality; the word &#1500;&#1506;&#1504;&#1492; (Aq. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  equals  wormwood) means in Arab. the curse. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is translated by Jerome after the lxx, gladius biceps; but &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1508;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; means double-edged, and &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; &#1508;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-16.htm">Judges 3:16</a>) means a doubled-edged sword. Here the plur. will thus poetically strengthen the meaning, like &#x3be;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, that which devours, as if it had three or four edges (Fl.). The end in which the disguised seduction terminates is bitter as the bitterest, and cutting as that which cuts the most: self-condemnation and a feeling of divine anger, anguish of heart, and destructive judgment. The feet of the adulteress go downward to death. In Hebr. this descendentes ad mortem is expressed by the genitive of connection; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is the genitive, as in &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-12.htm">Proverbs 1:12</a>; elsewhere the author uses &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-27.htm">Proverbs 7:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-18.htm">Proverbs 2:18</a>. Death, &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (so named from the stretching of the corpse after the stiffness of death), denotes the condition of departure from this side as a punishment, with which is associated the idea of divine wrath. In &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; (sinking, abyss, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, R. &#1513;&#1500;, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>), lie the ideas of the grave as a place of corruption, and of the under-world as the place of incorporeal shadow-life. Her steps hold fast to Hades is equivalent to, they strive after Hades and go straight to it; similar to this is the Arab. expression, hdha&#770; a&#770;ldrb ya&#770;khdh a&#770;ly a&#770;lbld: this way leads straight forward to the town (Fl.).</body></html>
