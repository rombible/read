That wealth which is truly desirable, has no vexation of spirit in the enjoyment; no grief for the loss; no guilt by the abuse of it. What comes from the love of God, has the grace of God for its companion. 23. Only foolish and wicked men divert themselves with doing harm to others, or tempting to sin. 24. The largest desire of eternal blessings the righteous can form, will be granted. 25. The course of prosperous sinners is like a whirlwind, which soon spends itself, and is gone. 26. As vinegar sets the teeth on edge, and as the smoke causes the eyes to smart, so the sluggard vexes his employer. 27,28. What man is he that loves life? Let him fear God, and that will secure to him life enough in this world, and eternal life in the other.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The teeth set on edge by the sour wine used by peasants <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, the eye irritated by wood-smoke, these shadow the annoyance of having a messenger who will loiter on the way. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. that is, causes vexation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As vinegar to the teeth; </span> Which by its cold and sharpness it offends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So is the sluggard; </span> unserviceable and vexatious. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As vinegar to the teeth,....

In a country where chimneys were unknown, and the fuel was wood or some substance more unsavoury, the eyes must have often been painfully affected by the household fire. Thus <span class="accented">lacrimosus</span>, "tear-producing," is a classical epithet of smoke (see Ovid, 'Metam.,' 10:6; Her., 'Sat.,' 1:5, 80). To these two annoyances is compared the messenger who loiters on his errand.

Like it, pure and noble, is whatever the righteous speaks; the heart, i.e., the manner of thought and feeling, of the godless is, on the contrary, like little instar nihili, i.e., of little or no worth, Arab. yasway ka&#770;lyla (Fl.). lxx: the heart of the godless &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, i.e., &#1497;&#1502;&#1506;&#1496;, at first arrogant and full of lofty plans, it becomes always the more dejected, discouraged, empty. But 20a leads us to expect some designation of its worth. The Targ. (according to which the Peshito is to be corrected; vid., Levy's Wrterbuch, ii.:26): the heart of the godless is &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1488; (from &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;), refuse, dross. The other Greek versions accord with the text before us. </body></html>
