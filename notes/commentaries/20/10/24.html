Indeed “wicked men frequently draw upon themselves what they feared, by the very means whereby they studied to avoid it; a remarkable example whereof, Bochart observes, we have in the builders of the tower of Babel: the very remedy of the evil they wished to avoid leading them directly to it.” And it may be added, a much more remarkable one we have in the Jews, who crucified Christ.

That wealth which is truly desirable, has no vexation of spirit in the enjoyment; no grief for the loss; no guilt by the abuse of it. What comes from the love of God, has the grace of God for its companion. 23. Only foolish and wicked men divert themselves with doing harm to others, or tempting to sin. 24. The largest desire of eternal blessings the righteous can form, will be granted. 25. The course of prosperous sinners is like a whirlwind, which soon spends itself, and is gone. 26. As vinegar sets the teeth on edge, and as the smoke causes the eyes to smart, so the sluggard vexes his employer. 27,28. What man is he that loves life?

What he dreads in his own mind will be his unhappy case, sooner or later it comes upon him; his fear of distresses, calamities, and judgments in this life, and of eternal wrath and vengeance hereafter; for the most profligate and abandoned wretches, the greatest atheists, who endeavour to work themselves up to a disbelief of a God and a future state, have at times their frights and fears about these things; and as are their fears of God, so will his wrath be, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-11.htm">Psalm 90:11</a>. Jarchi illustrates this in the instance of the builders of Babel, who were afraid of being scattered upon the face of the earth, which thing feared came upon them through and for their building of the tower; and so it sometimes is, that the very thing which men fear comes upon them by the means which they take to prevent it; so the Jews were afraid that if their people believed in Jesus of Nazareth, the Romans would come and seize their city and nation, and therefore endeavoured to persuade them to reject him; for which rejection of him the thing they feared came upon them; <p>but the desire of the righteous shall be granted; or "he shall give" (s); that is, God shall give it; who has it in his hands or power to give it, as Jarchi's note is: what a righteous man desires from right principles, and with right views; what is for his own good and the glory of God; what he asks in faith, and with submission to the divine will, and is according to it, is sooner or later, in God's own time and way, granted unto him: particularly his desires after righteousness; after the righteousness of Christ, and to be found alone in that, living and dying; after holiness of heart and life, that he might be cleansed and kept from sin, and preserved to the coming of Christ; after more grace, an increase of it, and fresh supplies from Christ; after more communion with God and Christ, and conformity to them; after glory and happiness, and a being with them to all eternity. Some understand this of the righteous man's desire upon the wicked; that his fear might come upon him, and the glory of divine justice appear in his swift and sudden destruction; as expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-25.htm">Proverbs 10:25</a>; so Aben Ezra. <p>(s) "dabit", Pagninus, Montanus, Baynus; "justis dat quod cupiunt", Tigurine version; "dabit Deus", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Michaelis; "dat Deus", Mercerus, Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - This verse is connected in thought with the preceding.

But (1) to hide hatred (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-24.htm">Proverbs 26:24</a>) is something altogether different from to cover sin (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a>), or generally to keep anything secret with discretion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-13.htm">Proverbs 10:13</a>); and (2) that &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; is a corrupt reading for &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1; (as Grabe supposes, and Symmachus translates) or &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; (as Lagarde supposes, and indeed is found in Codd.). Michaelis well remarks: odium tectum est dolosi, manifesta sycophantia stultorum. Whoever conceals hateful feelings behind his words is &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;&#1512;, a mouth of falsehood (cf. the mouth of the fool, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-14.htm">Proverbs 10:14</a>); one does not need to supply &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, but much rather has hence to conclude that a false man is simply so named, as is proved by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/120-3.htm">Psalm 120:3</a>. There is a second moral judgment, 18b: he who spreadeth slander (&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;, according to the Masoretic writing: he who divulges it, the correlate to &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, to bring to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-2.htm">Genesis 37:2</a>) is a Thor fool, stupid, dull, &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; (not a Narr fool, godless person, &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500;); for such slandering can generally bring no advantage; it injures the reputation of him to whom the &#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, i.e., the secret report, the slander, refers; it sows discord, has incalculable consequences, and finally brings guilt on the tale-bearer himself. </body></html>
