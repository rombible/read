And as the &#1495;&#1505;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489; offers a vacuum to Wisdom which may perhaps be filled with the right contents, so is this vacuum welcome to Folly, because it meets there no resistance. In this sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-16.htm">Proverbs 9:16</a> is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-4.htm">Proverbs 9:4</a> (excepting the addition of a connecting and of a concluding &#1493;: et si quis excors, tum dicit ei); the word is the same in both, but the meaning, according to the two speakers, is different. That to which they both invite is the pleasure of her fellowship, under the symbol of eating and drinking; in the one case it is intellectual and spiritual enjoyment, in the other sensual. That Wisdom offers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-5.htm">Proverbs 9:5</a>) bread and wine, and Folly water and bread, has its reason in this, that the particular pleasure to which the latter invites is of a sensual kind; for to drink water out of his own or out of another fountain is (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15-20</a>) the symbol of intercourse in married life, or of intercourse between the unmarried, particularly of adulterous intercourse. &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (correct texts have it thus, without the Makkeph) is sexual intercourse which is stolen from him who has a right thereto, thus carnal intercourse with &#1488;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;; and &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1505;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; fleshly lust, which, because it is contrary to the law, must seek (cf. furtum, secret love intrigue) concealment (&#1505;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, extensive plur., as &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;; Bttcher, 694). Just such pleasure, after which one wipes his mouth as if he had done nothing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-20.htm">Proverbs 30:20</a>), is for men who are without wisdom sweet (&#1502;&#1514;&#1511;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-12.htm">Job 20:12</a>) and pleasant; the prohibition of it gives to such pleasure attraction, and the secrecy adds seasoning; and just such enjoyments the &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, personified carnality, offers. But woe to him who, befooled, enters her house! </body></html>
