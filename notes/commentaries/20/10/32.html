Smoke makes itself disagreeably perceptible to the sense of smell, and particularly to the eyes, which it causes to smart so that they overflow with tears; wherefore Virgil speaks of it as amarus, and Horace lacrimosus. &#1495;&#1502;&#1509; (from &#1495;&#1502;&#1509;, to be sour, harsh) signifies properly that which is sour, as acetum, &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; here, after the lxx &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3be;, the unripe grapes, but which are called &#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512;) (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-33.htm">Job 15:33</a>), by which the Syr., here following the lxx, translates, and which also in the Talmud, Dema i. 1, is named &#1495;&#1502;&#1509;, after a doubtful meaning (vid., Aruch, and on the other side Rashi), thus: vinegar, which the word commonly means, and which also accords with the object of the comparison, especially if one thinks of the sharp vinegar-wine of the south, which has an effect on the teeth denoted by the Hebr. verb &#1511;&#1492;&#1492;, as the effect of smoke is by &#1499;&#1492;&#1492; (Fl.).

They who send a sluggard, i.e., who make him their agent, do it to their own sorrow; his slothfulness is for them, and for that which they have in view, of dull, i.e., slow and restrained, of biting, i.e., sensibly injurious operation. </body></html>
