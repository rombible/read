Both the just and the wicked must die; but between their souls there is a vast difference. 8. The wise in heart puts his knowledge in practice. 9. Dissemblers, after all their shuffling, will be exposed. 10. Trick and artifice will be no excuse for iniquity. 11. The good man's mouth is always open to teach, comfort, and correct others. 12. Where there is hatred, every thing stirs up strife. By bearing with each other, peace and harmony are preserved. 13. Those that foolishly go on in wicked ways, prepare rods for themselves. 14. Whatever knowledge may be useful, we must lay it up, that it may not be to seek when we want it. The wise gain this wisdom by reading, by hearing the word, by meditation, by prayer, by faith in Christ, who is made of God unto us wisdom. 15. This refers to the common mistakes both of rich and poor, as to their outward condition. Rich people's wealth exposes them to many dangers; while a poor man may live comfortably, if he is content, keeps a good conscience, and lives by faith. 16. Perhaps a righteous man has no more than what he works hard for, but that labour tends to life. 17. The traveller that has missed his way, and cannot bear to be told of it, and to be shown the right way, must err still. 18. He is especially a fool who thinks to hide anything from God; and malice is no better. 19. Those that speak much, speak much amiss. He that checks himself is a wise man, and therein consults his own peace. 20,21. The tongue of the just is sincere, freed from the dross of guile and evil design. Pious discourse is spiritual food to the needy. Fools die for want of a heart, so the word is; for want of thought.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lay up - The point of the maxim is that the wise man reserves what he has to say for the right time, place, and persons (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>), as contrasted with the foolish, ever giving immediate utterance to what destroys himself and others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. lay up knowledge&#8212;that is, as treasures for good use.<p>mouth &#8230; destruction&#8212;or, "as to the mouth," &c., destruction is near; they expose themselves to evil by prating.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wise men lay up, </span> to wit, in their minds and memories, to be brought forth thence upon fit occasions, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">knowledge; </span> whereby they may be enabled to speak both what and when it is seasonable, for their own or others’ good. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The mouth of the foolish is near destruction; </span> fools are more forward to lay out than to lay up, and for want of knowledge speak much and foolishly, whereby they frequently bring destruction upon themselves <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wise men lay up knowledge,....

Such an one does not make his own knowledge the ne plus ultra, nor does he make his own will the noli me tangere; but he takes commands, i.e., instructions directing or prohibiting, to which he willingly subordinates himself as the outflow of a higher knowledge and will, and by which he sets bounds and limits to himself. But a fool of the lips, i.e., a braggart blunderer, one pleasing himself with vain talk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-23.htm">Proverbs 14:23</a>), falls prostrate, for he thinks that he knows all things better, and will take no pattern; but while he boasts himself from on high, suddenly all at once - for he offends against the fundamental principle of common life and of morality - he comes to lie low down on the ground. The Syr. and Targ. translate &#1497;&#1500;&#1468;&#1489;&#1496; by, he is caught (Bertheau, ensnared); Aquila, Vulgate, Luther, &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, he is slain; Symmachus, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; but all without any support in the usage of the language known to us. Theodotion, &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, he is confounded, is not tenable; Joseph Kimchi, who after David Kimchi, under <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/4-14.htm">Hosea 4:14</a>, appeals in support of this meaning (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, similarly Parchon: &#1497;&#1514;&#1489;&#1500;&#1489;&#1500;) to the Arabic, seems to think on iltiba&#770;s, confusion. The demonstrable meanings of the verb &#1500;&#1489;&#1496; are the following: 1. To occasion trouble. Thus Mechilta, under <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>, &#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1493;&#1492;&#1493;, one has imposed upon him trouble; Sifri, under <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a>, &#1504;&#1514;&#1500;&#1489;&#1496;&#1504;&#1493;, we are tired, according to which Rashi: he fatigues himself, but which fits neither to the subj. nor to the contrast, which is to be supposed. The same may be said of the meaning of the Syr. lbt, to drive on, to press, which without doubt accords with the former meaning of the word in the language of the Midrash. 2. In Arab. labat&#803; (R. lab, vid., Wnsche's Hos. p. 172), to throw any one down to the earth, so that he falls with his whole body his whole length; the passive &#1504;&#1500;&#1489;&#1496;, to be thus thrown down by another, or to throw oneself thus down, figuratively of one who falls hopelessly into evil and destruction (Fl.). The Arabic verb is also used of the springing run of the animal ridden on (to gallop), and of the being lame (to hop), according to which in the Lex. the explanations, he hurries, or he wavers hither and thither, are offered by Kimchi (Graec. Venet. &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;). But the former of these explanations, corruit ( equals  in calamitatem ruit), placed much nearer by the Arabic, is confirmed by the lxx &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, and by the Bershith rabba, c. 52, where &#1500;&#1489;&#1496; is used in the sense to be ruined ( equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;). Hitzig changes the passive into the active: "he throws the offered &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; scornfully to the ground," but the contrast does not require this. The wanton, arrogant boasting lies already in the designation of the subj. &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;; and the sequel involves, as a consequence, the contrasted consequence of ready reception of the limitations and guidance of his own will by a higher. </body></html>
