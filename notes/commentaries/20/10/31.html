The Aram., Jerome, and Graec. Venet. interpret &#1499; of comparison, so that the destruction of the godless is compared in suddenness and rapidity to the rushing past of a storm; but then &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; ought to have been used instead of &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492;; and instead of &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; with the &#1493; apodosis, a disturbing element in such a comparison, would have been used &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1507; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, or at least &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;. The thought is no other than that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a> : the storm, which is called &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1492;, from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, to rush forth, is meant, as sweeping forth, and &#1499; the temporal, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-4.htm">Exodus 11:4</a> (lxx &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), with &#1493; htiw ,)&#1506;&#1503;&#1492; apod. following, like e.g., after a similar member of a temporal sentence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-25.htm">Isaiah 10:25</a>. &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1492; is a figure of God-decreed calamities, as war and pestilence, under which the godless sink, while the righteous endure them; cf. with 25a, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-18.htm">Isaiah 28:18</a>; and with 25b, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-25.htm">Isaiah 3:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>. "An everlasting foundation," since &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; is understood as looking forwards, not as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>, backwards, is a foundation capable of being shaken by nothing, and synecdoch. generally a building. The proverb reminds us of the close of the Sermon on the Mount, and finds the final confirmation of its truth in this, that the death of the godless is a penal thrusting of them away, but the death of the righteous a lifting them up to their home. The righteous also often enough perish in times of war and of pestilence; but the proverb, as it is interpreted, verifies itself, even although not so as the poet, viewing it from his narrow O.T. standpoint, understood it; for the righteous, let him die when and how he may, is preserved, while the godless perishes. </body></html>
