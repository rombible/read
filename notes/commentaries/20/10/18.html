Both the just and the wicked must die; but between their souls there is a vast difference. 8. The wise in heart puts his knowledge in practice. 9. Dissemblers, after all their shuffling, will be exposed. 10. Trick and artifice will be no excuse for iniquity. 11. The good man's mouth is always open to teach, comfort, and correct others. 12. Where there is hatred, every thing stirs up strife. By bearing with each other, peace and harmony are preserved. 13. Those that foolishly go on in wicked ways, prepare rods for themselves. 14. Whatever knowledge may be useful, we must lay it up, that it may not be to seek when we want it. The wise gain this wisdom by reading, by hearing the word, by meditation, by prayer, by faith in Christ, who is made of God unto us wisdom. 15. This refers to the common mistakes both of rich and poor, as to their outward condition. Rich people's wealth exposes them to many dangers; while a poor man may live comfortably, if he is content, keeps a good conscience, and lives by faith. 16. Perhaps a righteous man has no more than what he works hard for, but that labour tends to life. 17. The traveller that has missed his way, and cannot bear to be told of it, and to be shown the right way, must err still. 18. He is especially a fool who thinks to hide anything from God; and malice is no better. 19. Those that speak much, speak much amiss. He that checks himself is a wise man, and therein consults his own peace. 20,21. The tongue of the just is sincere, freed from the dross of guile and evil design. Pious discourse is spiritual food to the needy. Fools die for want of a heart, so the word is; for want of thought.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Better, He who hideth hatred is of lying lips.

Or he whose "lying lips hide hatred", which is much the same; who pretends to be a friend, and outwardly behaves as one, but inwardly nourishes and cherishes hatred in his heart, which he covers and conceals, till he has a proper opportunity of showing it; as Absalom to Ammon, Joab to Amasa, the men of Anathoth to Jeremiah, and Judas to Christ; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-24.htm">Proverbs 26:24</a>. Or, "he that hideth hatred is a man of lying lips" (m); he is a liar, as the person next described is a fool. And he that uttereth slander is a fool; that brings it out by wholesale, and hides it not; who openly defames his neighbour, and in the most public manner; and with a multitude of words detracts from his good name, credit, and reputation, and loads him with calumny and reproach; such a man is a fool, a very wicked man: yea, not only the public slanderer, but the secret dissembler, who thinks himself a cunning man because he hides himself; each of these is a fool, the one as well as the other. Gersom thinks there is a comparison made between the dissembler and the slanderer; the one being a liar, and the other a fool; and that the former is more abominable and pernicious than the latter. <p>(m) "Est vir laborium falsitatis", Piscator, "vel fallacium", Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. with <span class="ital">lying lips</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">is of lying lips</span>, R.V.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - This verse ought to be translated, <span class="cmt_word">He that hideth hatred is</span> [a man] <span class="cmt_word">of lying lips, and he that uttereth slander is a fool</span>. He who cherishes hatred in the heart must be a liar and a hypocrite, speaking and acting in a way contrary to his real sentiments; if he divulges his slander, he is a stupid fool, injuring his neighbour, and procuring ill will for himself. The LXX. reads, "Just (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) lips conceal hatred;" but probably <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> is an error for <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, though Ewald defends it, and would alter the Hebrew to suit it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Another proverb of the different effects of hatred and of love:<p>Hate stirreth up strife,<p>And love covereth all transgressions.<p>Regarding &#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, for which the Ker&#305;&#770; elsewhere substitutes &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>. Hatred of one's neighbour, which is of itself an evil, has further this bad effect, that it calls forth hatred, and thus stirreth up strife, feuds, factions, for it incites man against man (cf. &#1506;&#1512;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>); on the contrary, love covers not merely little errors, but also greater sins of every kind (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;), viz., by pardoning them, concealing them, excusing them, if possible, with mitigating circumstances, or restraining them before they are executed. All this lies in the covering. James, however, gives it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>, another rendering: love covers them, viz., from the eyes of a holy God; for it forgives them to the erring brother, and turns him from the error of his way. The lxx improperly translate &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;; but Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a>) as well as James, but none of the Greek versions; &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;. The Romish Church makes use of this passage as a proof for the introduction of the fides formata, viz., caritate, in justification, which is condemned in the Apology of the Augsburg Confession; and, indeed, the multitudo peccatorum is not meant of the sins of him who cherishes love, but of the sins of the neighbour. Sin stirs up hatred in men in their relation to one another; but love covers the already existing sins, and smooths the disturbances occasioned by them. </body></html>
