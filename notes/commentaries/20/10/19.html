Both the just and the wicked must die; but between their souls there is a vast difference. 8. The wise in heart puts his knowledge in practice. 9. Dissemblers, after all their shuffling, will be exposed. 10. Trick and artifice will be no excuse for iniquity. 11. The good man's mouth is always open to teach, comfort, and correct others. 12. Where there is hatred, every thing stirs up strife. By bearing with each other, peace and harmony are preserved. 13. Those that foolishly go on in wicked ways, prepare rods for themselves. 14. Whatever knowledge may be useful, we must lay it up, that it may not be to seek when we want it. The wise gain this wisdom by reading, by hearing the word, by meditation, by prayer, by faith in Christ, who is made of God unto us wisdom. 15. This refers to the common mistakes both of rich and poor, as to their outward condition. Rich people's wealth exposes them to many dangers; while a poor man may live comfortably, if he is content, keeps a good conscience, and lives by faith. 16. Perhaps a righteous man has no more than what he works hard for, but that labour tends to life. 17. The traveller that has missed his way, and cannot bear to be told of it, and to be shown the right way, must err still. 18. He is especially a fool who thinks to hide anything from God; and malice is no better. 19. Those that speak much, speak much amiss. He that checks himself is a wise man, and therein consults his own peace. 20,21. The tongue of the just is sincere, freed from the dross of guile and evil design. Pious discourse is spiritual food to the needy. Fools die for want of a heart, so the word is; for want of thought.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There wanteth not sin - Some render this, "Sin shall not cease," etc., i. e., many words do not mend a fault.

Where a great deal is said, without care and forethought, there will not only be many weak things uttered, but much falsehood, and at least many idle things, which cannot be excused from sin; not but that much and long speaking may be to great profit and advantage, when it is with care and judgment, and founded on close meditation and study. Or, "sin ceaseth not" (n); along with a torrent of words is a flow of sin, which ceases not as long as that continues: it is a saying of the Jewish Rabbins, <p>"he that multiplies words brings on or brings unto sin;'' <p>but he that refraineth his lips is wise; lays a restraint on his mouth, bridles his tongue; does not suffer his lips to utter anything rashly and inconsiderately; is sparing of his words and is careful of what he says, that it is true and proper to be spoken; and considers well the time when, place where, and persons to whom he speaks; and, all circumstances weighed, conducts accordingly: such a man is a wise, prudent, and understanding man; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-27.htm">Proverbs 17:27</a>. <p>(n)  "non cessabit", Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Michaelis; "non cessat", Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>.

Loquacity leads to exaggeration and untruthfulness, slander and uncharitableness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:1-3</a>; and Christ's and James's solemn warnings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>, etc.). "Speak little," says Pinart ('Meditations,' ch. 6.), "because for one sin which we may commit by keeping silence where it would be well to speak, we commit a hundred by speaking upon all occasions" (see on Proverbs 17:27), Another rendering of the passage gives "By multitude of words sin does not vanish away;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you cannot mend a fault by much talking. But this weakens the contrast, and the Authorized Version is correct. <span class="cmt_word">Is wise.</span> St. James calls the reticent "a perfect man" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a>). "This sentence of Scripture," says St. Augustine, in his 'Retractations,' "I greatly fear, because my numerous treatises, I know well, contain many things, if not false, at any rate idle and unnecessary." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There follow now two other proverbs on the use and abuse of speech:<p>On the lips of the man of understanding wisdom is found;<p>And the rod for the back of the fool.<p>With Lwenstein, Hitzig, and others, it is inadmissible to regard &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; as a second subject to &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;. The mouth itself, or the word of the mouth, may be called a rod, viz., a rod of correction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>); but that wisdom and such a rod are found on the lips of the wise would be a combination and a figure in bad taste. Thus 13b is a clause by itself, as Luther renders it: "but a rod belongs to the fool's back;" and this will express a contrast to 13a, that while wisdom is to be sought for on the lips of the man of understanding (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>), a man devoid of understanding, on the contrary, gives himself to such hollow and corrupt talk, that in order to educate him to something better, if possible, the rod must be applied to his back; for, according to the Talmudic proverb: that which a wise man gains by a hint, a fool only obtains by a club. The rod is called &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;, to be smooth, to go straight down (as the hair of the head); and the back &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1492;, to be rounded, i.e., concave or convex. </body></html>
