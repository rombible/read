Both the just and the wicked must die; but between their souls there is a vast difference. 8. The wise in heart puts his knowledge in practice. 9. Dissemblers, after all their shuffling, will be exposed. 10. Trick and artifice will be no excuse for iniquity. 11. The good man's mouth is always open to teach, comfort, and correct others. 12. Where there is hatred, every thing stirs up strife. By bearing with each other, peace and harmony are preserved. 13. Those that foolishly go on in wicked ways, prepare rods for themselves. 14. Whatever knowledge may be useful, we must lay it up, that it may not be to seek when we want it. The wise gain this wisdom by reading, by hearing the word, by meditation, by prayer, by faith in Christ, who is made of God unto us wisdom. 15. This refers to the common mistakes both of rich and poor, as to their outward condition. Rich people's wealth exposes them to many dangers; while a poor man may live comfortably, if he is content, keeps a good conscience, and lives by faith. 16. Perhaps a righteous man has no more than what he works hard for, but that labour tends to life. 17. The traveller that has missed his way, and cannot bear to be told of it, and to be shown the right way, must err still. 18. He is especially a fool who thinks to hide anything from God; and malice is no better. 19. Those that speak much, speak much amiss. He that checks himself is a wise man, and therein consults his own peace. 20,21. The tongue of the just is sincere, freed from the dross of guile and evil design. Pious discourse is spiritual food to the needy. Fools die for want of a heart, so the word is; for want of thought.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Destruction - That which crushes, throws into ruins.

What a fortified city is to persons in time of war, that is a rich man's wealth to him; by it he can defend himself from the injuries of others, and support himself and family in times of public calamity; for money is a defence, and answers all things, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>. Or his wealth is so in his own apprehension and conceit; he puts his trust and confidence in it, and thinks himself safe and secure by it; when he is trusting to uncertain riches, which will fail him; these may fly away from him in life, and leave him exposed to distress and danger; and, however, will not secure him at death from the wrath of God and everlasting destruction. Or he is lifted up with his riches, is in high spirits, and despises others; thinking himself safe, as in a strong castle, and fears nothing, distresses, diseases, or death; <p>the destruction of the poor is their poverty: or their poverty is their consternation, as the word (h) signifies, it frightens them; they, knowing their circumstances, are afraid of everybody and of every thing; not being able to defend themselves against their enemies, or support themselves in times of public calamity, as war, famine, or pestilence. <p>(h) "consternatio", Mercerus, Gejerus, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The rich man's wealth <i>is</i> his <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> strong city: the destruction of the poor <i>is</i> their poverty.</span><p>(h) And so makes him bold to do evil, while poverty bridles the poor from many evil things.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">destruction</span>] The Heb. word is the same as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-14.htm" title="Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.">Proverbs 10:14</a></span>.

Wealth is a help in many ways, securing from dangers, giving time and opportunity for acquiring wisdom, making one independent and free in action (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>; Ecclus. 40:25, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The destruction of the poor is their poverty.</span> The poor are crushed, exposed to all kinds of evil, moral and material, by their want of means.

For &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1514;&#1468;&#1501; at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>, there is here &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;  equals  &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1514;&#1493;&#1501;; so &#1502;&#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; denotes, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-15.htm">Proverbs 2:15</a>, such an one &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1493; &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;. Expressed in the language of the N.T., &#1514;&#1493;&#1501; is the property of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; or &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, for the fundamental idea of fulness is here referred to full submission, full integrity. Such an one goes &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495; (Aquila, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;), for there is nothing designedly concealed by him, of which he has reason to fear that it will come to the light; whoever, on the contrary, makes his ways crooked, i.e., turns into crooked ways, is perceived, or, as we might also explain it (vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-15.htm">Genesis 4:15</a>): if one (qui  equals  si quis) makes his ways crooked, then it is known - nothing, however, stands opposed to the reference of &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506; to the person: he is finally known, i.e., unmasked (lxx Jerome, &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, manifestus fiet). Usually it is explained: he is knowing, clever, with the remark that &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506; is here the passive of &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506; (Gesen., Ewald, Hitzig); Hiph. to give to feel; Niph. to become to feel, properly to be made to know (Luth.: made wise); but the passive of the Hiph. is the Hoph. Such a Niph. in which the causative (not simply transitive) signification of the Hiph. would be applied passively is without example (vid., Ewald, 133a); the meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-19.htm">Jeremiah 31:19</a> also is: after I have become known, i.e., been made manifest, uncovered, drawn into the light. </body></html>
