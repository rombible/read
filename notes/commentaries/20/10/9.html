Both the just and the wicked must die; but between their souls there is a vast difference. 8. The wise in heart puts his knowledge in practice. 9. Dissemblers, after all their shuffling, will be exposed. 10. Trick and artifice will be no excuse for iniquity. 11. The good man's mouth is always open to teach, comfort, and correct others. 12. Where there is hatred, every thing stirs up strife. By bearing with each other, peace and harmony are preserved. 13. Those that foolishly go on in wicked ways, prepare rods for themselves. 14. Whatever knowledge may be useful, we must lay it up, that it may not be to seek when we want it. The wise gain this wisdom by reading, by hearing the word, by meditation, by prayer, by faith in Christ, who is made of God unto us wisdom. 15. This refers to the common mistakes both of rich and poor, as to their outward condition. Rich people's wealth exposes them to many dangers; while a poor man may live comfortably, if he is content, keeps a good conscience, and lives by faith. 16. Perhaps a righteous man has no more than what he works hard for, but that labour tends to life. 17. The traveller that has missed his way, and cannot bear to be told of it, and to be shown the right way, must err still. 18. He is especially a fool who thinks to hide anything from God; and malice is no better. 19. Those that speak much, speak much amiss. He that checks himself is a wise man, and therein consults his own peace. 20,21. The tongue of the just is sincere, freed from the dross of guile and evil design. Pious discourse is spiritual food to the needy. Fools die for want of a heart, so the word is; for want of thought.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall be known - literally, "shall be made to know" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-19.htm">Jeremiah 31:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-16.htm">Judges 8:16</a> margin) in the sense of exposed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. perverteth his ways&#8212;acts deceitfully.<p>known&#8212;discovered and punished.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He that walketh uprightly; </span> who is sincere, and just, and faithful in his dealings with God and with men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Surely; </span> or, <span class="ital">securely</span>, or <span class="ital">confidently</span>, as the word properly signifies, and is here rendered by all the ancient interpreters, and by most of the others; quietly resting upon God’s favour and gracious providence for his protection, and being supported by the testimony of a good conscience, and therefore not fearing nor caring who knows or observes his actions, which he endeavours to approve both to God and to men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That perverteth his ways; </span> that walks perversely, or frowardly, or in crooked and sinful paths; that dealeth hypocritically and deceitfully with God, or with men, using all possible crafts to conceal his wickedness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall be known; </span> his wickedness shall be publicly discovered, and so he shall be exposed to all that shame and punishment which his sins deserve, and which he thought by his cunning practices to avoid. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>He that walketh uprightly walketh surely,.... Or, "that walketh in perfection" (c) as the Targum. Not that walks without sin, no man does that; but that walks in the sincerity, integrity, and uprightness of his heart, both before God and men; who worships God in spirit and in truth, and speaks the truth in his heart to his neighbour; who is an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile; who walks uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel; who makes the word of God the rule of his life and actions; who walks by faith on Christ, using him as the way to the Father; believing in him for salvation; walking on in him as he has received him, and especially dealing with his uprightness or righteousness for his justification before God; who walks, as Christ did, in imitation of him; who walks in love, as he did, and in all humility, meekness, patience, and self-denial; who walks in and after the Spirit of Christ; and in the truths of the Gospel, and in all the ordinances thereof; and in all holy conversation and godliness, studying to exercise a conscience void of offence towards God and men. Such a man "walks surely", or securely, safely, confidently, as the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions, interpret the word. Such an one has nothing to fear in his walk; he walks on "terra firma", on good ground, in a good way, which leads to life eternal: he has a good guide, the Spirit of God, which goes before him, and will be his guide even unto death, and lead him in the way everlasting, unto the land of uprightness; he has a good guard about him, not only the angels of God that encamp around him, but God himself is a wall of fire to him, and his power surrounds and protects him; he has many precious promises to support him; not only that the Lord will be a buckler to him, but will withhold no good thing from him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>; he has the gracious and supporting presence of God, when he passes through the fire and water of afflictions, and even through the valley of the shadow of death, so that he has nothing to fear; and has moreover the testimony of a good conscience; and having a good hope through grace, he "walks in hope", as the Targum is; yea, rejoices in hope of the glory of God, and holds fast that rejoicing to the end; <p>but he that perverteth his ways shall be known; who does not walk in a plain, direct, and even path, according to the rule of the word, as the upright man; but winds about here and there, goes into crooked paths, walks in craftiness as deceitful workers, whose folly shall be made manifest; though they think to hide it, and deceive men, they and their wickedness shall be exposed, their tricks and artful methods shall be laid open, and they be known to be what they are; if not in this life, yet at the last judgment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-24.htm">1 Timothy 5:24</a>.

He shall be exposed and punished, and put to open shame. Having this apprehension always present, he cannot walk with confidence as the innocent does. Hence the antithesis in the text. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Another proverb, the members of which stand in chiastic relation to those of the preceding:<p>Jahve does not suffer the soul of the righteous to hunger;<p>But the craving of the godless He disappointeth.<p>The thought is the same as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-25.htm">Proverbs 13:25</a>. There, as also at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>, the soul is spoken of as the faculty of desire, and that after nourishment, for the lowest form of the life of the soul is the impulse to self-preservation. The parallel &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, in which lxx and Ar. erroneously find the meaning of &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, life, the Syr. Targ. the meaning of &#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, possession, means the desire, without however being related to &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; (Berth.); it is the Arab. hawan, from &#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, Arab. haway, which, from the fundamental meaning &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, hiare, to gape, yawn, signifies not only unrestrained driving along, and crashing overthrow (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-6.htm">Proverbs 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-13.htm">Proverbs 19:13</a>), but also the breaking forth, ferri in aliquid, whence &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;, Arab. hawan, violent desire, in Hebr. generally (here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/52-9.htm">Psalm 52:9</a>, Mich. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-3.htm">Proverbs 7:3</a>) of desire without limits and without restraint (cf. the plur. a&#770;hawa&#770;, arbitrary actions, caprices); the meanings deduced from this important verbal stem (of which also &#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, accidere, and then esse, at least after the Arabic conception of speech, is an offshoot) are given by Fleischer under <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a>, and after Fleischer by Eth, Schlafgemach der Phantasie, ii. p. 6f. The verb &#1492;&#1491;&#1507; signifies to push in the most manifold shades, here to push forth, repellere, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-27.htm">2 Kings 4:27</a> (cf. Arab. h&#803;adhaf, to push off  equals  to discharge); the fut. is invariably &#1497;&#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507;, like &#1497;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492;. God gives satisfaction to the soul of the righteous, viz., in granting blessings. The desire of the wicked He does not suffer to be accomplished; it may appear for a long time as if that which was aimed at was realized, but in the end God pushes it back, so that it remains at a distance, because contrary to Him. Instead of &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, some editions (Plantin 1566, Bragadin 1615) have &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501;, but, in opposition to all decided testimony, only through a mistaken reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-6.htm">Proverbs 11:6</a>. </body></html>
