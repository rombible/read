That is either remiss in giving to the necessities of others, according to his abilities, and as cases require; or that is negligent and slothful in his business. Or, "that worketh with a deceitful hand"; or, "with a hand of deceit" (u), as it may be rendered; who pretends to work, but does not; makes a show as if he did, but acts deceitfully; or who uses many tricking and deceitful ways and methods to live, as usually slothful persons do. Aben Ezra observes, it may be rendered and interpreted, "he becomes poor that makes a deceitful balance"; thinking to enrich himself by such fraudulent practices: or, as others, "a deceitful balance maketh poor" (w); such seldom or ever thrive, or it does not long prosper with them who use such unlawful methods; <p>but the hand of the diligent maketh rich; that is, with the blessing of God along with it, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-22.htm">Proverbs 10:22</a>; such who are "sharp" (x) and acute, as the word signifies; who are careful and industrious, mind their business, and do the honest part; these, with a divine blessing, frequently grow rich: or rather who are like those that dig in the earth for gold, who search for it with great eagerness and diligence; for from this root is a word often used for gold, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>. All this is true in a spiritual sense; such who are slothful in attendance on the means of grace, the word and ordinances, are slack and negligent in duty, bring a spiritual poverty upon them; and like the Laodicean church, who, through her lukewarmness and carnal security, became poor and wretched, blind and naked: on the other hand, such who are diligent in the use of means are frequent at the throne of grace, forsake not the assembly of the saints, constantly wait at Wisdom's gates; these grow rich in grace and in all good works. <p>(u)  "vola doli", Montanus; "fraudulenta manu", Tigurine version, Cocceius, Schultens; so Junius &amp; Tremellius, Michaelis.

The first word is <span class="accented">caph</span>, the open, ineffective, hand or palm; the second term is <span class="accented">yad</span>, the hand tense and braced for vigorous work.

The sentence is quoted by St. Augustine, 'De Civil Dei,' 16:2. The Vulgate inserts another paragraph, which is also found in some manuscripts of the Septuagint at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12</a>: <span class="accented">Qui nititur</span> <span class="accented">mendaciis, hic pascit ventos</span>; <span class="accented">idem autem ipse sequitur aves volantes</span>, "He who relieth on lies feedeth on the winds, and pursueth flying birds." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The woman, who in her own person serves as a sign to her house, addresses those who pass by in their innocence (&#1500;&#1514;&#1502;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-11.htm">2 Samuel 15:11</a>):<p>16 "Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither!"<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And if any one is devoid of understanding, she saith to him:<p>17 "Stolen waters taste sweet,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the bread of secrecy is pleasant."<p>&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; (folly, simplicity) has a side accessible to good and its contrary: Wisdom is connected with the one side, and Folly with the other. And as the &#1495;&#1505;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489; offers a vacuum to Wisdom which may perhaps be filled with the right contents, so is this vacuum welcome to Folly, because it meets there no resistance. In this sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-16.htm">Proverbs 9:16</a> is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-4.htm">Proverbs 9:4</a> (excepting the addition of a connecting and of a concluding &#1493;: et si quis excors, tum dicit ei); the word is the same in both, but the meaning, according to the two speakers, is different. That to which they both invite is the pleasure of her fellowship, under the symbol of eating and drinking; in the one case it is intellectual and spiritual enjoyment, in the other sensual. That Wisdom offers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-5.htm">Proverbs 9:5</a>) bread and wine, and Folly water and bread, has its reason in this, that the particular pleasure to which the latter invites is of a sensual kind; for to drink water out of his own or out of another fountain is (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15-20</a>) the symbol of intercourse in married life, or of intercourse between the unmarried, particularly of adulterous intercourse. &#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; (correct texts have it thus, without the Makkeph) is sexual intercourse which is stolen from him who has a right thereto, thus carnal intercourse with &#1488;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;; and &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1505;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; fleshly lust, which, because it is contrary to the law, must seek (cf. furtum, secret love intrigue) concealment (&#1505;&#1514;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, extensive plur., as &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;; Bttcher, 694). Just such pleasure, after which one wipes his mouth as if he had done nothing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-20.htm">Proverbs 30:20</a>), is for men who are without wisdom sweet (&#1502;&#1514;&#1511;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-12.htm">Job 20:12</a>) and pleasant; the prohibition of it gives to such pleasure attraction, and the secrecy adds seasoning; and just such enjoyments the &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, personified carnality, offers. But woe to him who, befooled, enters her house! </body></html>
