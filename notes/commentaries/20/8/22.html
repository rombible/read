From the fact that “set up” and “brought forth” are used just after as synonyms to it, it is most likely that (1) is the proper meaning of the word here, and that the sense of the passage is that Wisdom was “formed” or “begotten” before the Creation, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-24.htm" title="O LORD, how manifold are your works! in wisdom have you made them all: the earth is full of your riches.">Psalm 104:24</a>. This agrees with the rendering of the most important Greek translation, the Septuagint (<span class= "greekheb">έκτισε</span>). When in Christian times it was observed how well the description of Wisdom in Job and Proverbs harmonised with that of God the Son in the New Testament, such passages as this were universally applied to Him, and the present one was rightly interpreted as describing His eternal generation from the Father. Such was the view, for instance, of Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, and Tertullian. But when the Arian controversy arose, this phrase was seized upon by the opponents of our Lord’s Divinity, and claimed as teaching that He was, though the highest of created beings, still only a creature. The Catholics then changed their ground, some standing up for the rendering of Aquila, <span class= "greekheb">ἐκτήσατο </span>(“acquired” or “possessed”), others applying the term <span class= "greekheb">έκτισε</span> to Christ’s Incarnation (comp. “first-begotten among many brethren,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>), or to His being appointed to be the first principle or efficient cause of His creatures, the “beginning of the creation of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14</a>).

Wisdom reveals herself as preceding all creation, stamped upon it all, one with God, yet in some way distinguishable from Him as the object of His love <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-30.htm">Proverbs 8:30</a>. John declares that all which Wisdom here speaks of herself was true in its highest sense of the Word that became flesh <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-14</a> : just as Apostles afterward applied Wisd. 7:22-30 to Christ (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p>Possessed - The word has acquired a special prominence in connection with the Arian controversy. The meaning which it usually bears is that of "getting" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a>, "buying" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/47-22.htm">Genesis 47:22</a>, "possessing" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-15.htm">Jeremiah 32:15</a>. In this sense one of the oldest divine names was that of "Possessor of heaven and earth" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22</a>. But the idea of thus "getting" or "possessing" involved, as a divine act in relation to the universe, the idea of creation, and thus in one or two passages the word might be rendered, though not accurately, by "created" (e. g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13</a>). It would seem accordingly as if the Greek translators of the Old Testament oscillated between the two meanings; and in this passage we find the various renderings &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;  ektise "created" (Septuagint), and &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;  ekte&#772;sato "possessed" (Aquila). The text with the former word naturally became one of the stock arguments of the Arians against the eternal co-existence of the Son, and the other translation was as vehemently defended by the orthodox fathers. Athanasius receiving &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  ektisen, took it in the sense of appointing, and saw in the Septuagint a declaration that the Father had made the Son the "chief," the "head," the "sovereign," over all creation. There does not seem indeed any ground for the thought of creation either in the meaning of the root, or in the general usage of the word. What is meant in this passage is that we cannot think of God as ever having been without Wisdom. She is "as the beginning of His ways." So far as the words bear upon Christian dogma, they accord with the words of <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>, "the Word was with God." The next words indeed assert priority to all the works of God, from the first starting point of time. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-31. Strictly, God's attributes are part of Himself. Yet, to the poetical structure of the whole passage, this commendation of wisdom is entirely consonant. In order of time all His attributes are coincident and eternal as Himself. But to set forth the importance of wisdom as devising the products of benevolence and power, it is here assigned a precedence. As it has such in divine, so should it be desired in human, affairs (compare Pr 3:19).<p>possessed&#8212;or, "created"; in either sense, the idea of precedence.<p>in the beginning&#8212;or simply, "beginning," in apposition with "me."<p>before &#8230; of old&#8212;preceding the most ancient deeds.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Possessed me, </span> as his Son by eternal generation, who was from eternity with him, as is said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-10.htm" title="Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.">John 14:10</a></span>; and <span class="ital">in him</span>, as he also was in me, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-10.htm" title="Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.">John 14:10</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the beginning; </span> yea, and before the beginning, as it is largely expressed in the following verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of his way; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Not "created me", as the Targum and the Septuagint version; which version Arius following gave birth to his pernicious doctrine; who from hence concluded Christ is a creature, and was the first creature that God made, not of the same but of a like nature with himself, in some moment or period of eternity; and by whom he made all others: the Word, or Wisdom of God is never said to be created; and if as such he was created, God must have been without his Wisdom before he was created; besides, Christ, as the Word and Wisdom of God, is the Creator of all things, and not created, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; but this possession is not in right of creation, as the word is sometimes used, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1</a>; it might be more truly rendered, "the Lord begat me", as the word is translated by the Septuagint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-5.htm">Zechariah 13:5</a>; it denotes the Lord's having, possessing, and enjoying his word and wisdom as his own proper Son; which possession of him is expressed by his being with him and in him, and in his bosom, and as one brought forth and brought up by him; as he was "in the beginning of his way" of creation, when he went forth in his wisdom and power, and created all things; then he did possess his Son, and made use of him, for by him he made the worlds: and "in the beginning of his way" of grace, which was before his way of creation; he began with him when he first went out in acts of grace towards his people; his first thoughts, purposes, and decrees concerning their happiness, were in him; the choice of their persons was made in him; God was in him contriving the scheme of their peace, reconciliation, and salvation; the covenant of grace was made with him, and all fulness of grace was treasured up in him: the words may be rendered, "the Lord possessed me, the beginning of his way" (h); that is, who am the beginning, as he is; the beginning of the creation of God, the first cause, the efficient of it, both old and new; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>. So Aben Ezra, who compares with this <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-19.htm">Job 40:19</a>.

This word has been a battleground of controversy since the days of the Arian heresy. But it is well to remember that, all theological questions apart, it is impossible to understand the word, whatever rendering of it we adopt, as indicating that Wisdom ever had a beginning, or was ever properly speaking created. Wisdom is inseparable from any worthy conception of Him who is “the only wise God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1 Timothy 1:17</a>), and therefore is like Him “from everlasting to everlasting” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-1.htm" title="Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations.">Psalm 90:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Heb. word seems properly to mean, <span class="ital">to acquire</span>, and so <span class="ital">to possess</span>, (comparavit, emit, acquisivit, acquisitum possedit,” Buxtorf, <span class="ital">ad verb</span>.), without defining the method of acquisition. Thus Eve says on the birth of Cain, whom she named accordingly, “I have <span class="ital">gotten</span> a man with <span class="ital">the help of</span> Jehovah” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-1.htm" title="And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.">Genesis 4:1</a>). Almighty God is called “the <span class="ital">possessor</span> of heaven and earth” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-19.htm" title="And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth:">Genesis 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm" title="And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up my hand to the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth,">Genesis 14:22</a>) which He created; land is said to be <span class="ital">acquired</span>, which is bought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/47-22.htm" title="Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: why they sold not their lands....">Genesis 47:22-23</a>); and a son to be <span class="ital">bought</span> (A.V. and R.V. text, or <span class="ital">possessed</span> or <span class="ital">gotten</span>, R.V. marg.) by his father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-6.htm" title="Do you thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he your father that has bought you? has he not made you, and established you?">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-13.htm" title="For you have possessed my reins: you have covered me in my mother's womb.">Psalm 139:13</a>, “Thou hast <span class="ital">possessed</span> my reins,” A.V. and R.V. text, “or <span class="ital">formed</span>,” R.V. marg.). And so again it is used of an <span class="ital">owner</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm" title="The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know, my people does not consider.">Isaiah 1:3</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The rendering, <span class="ital">Jehovah possessed me</span>, would seem therefore most accurately to represent the original, while the idea contained in the word lends itself readily in the higher reference of the passage, to the Catholic doctrine of the Eternal Generation of the Son.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>in <span class="ital">the beginning</span>] There is no preposition in the Hebrew. We might therefore render, with R.V. marg., <span class="bld">as</span> <span class="ital">the beginning</span> (lit. <span class="bld">the beginning</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔκτισέ με ἀρχὴν ὁδῶν αὐτοῦ</span>, LXX.). And so the same Heb. word is rendered in the next verse, <span class="ital">or ever the earth was</span>, lit. <span class="ital">from the beginning of the earth</span>. But the rendering of A.V. and R.V. text is preferable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">before</span>] Or, <span class="ital">the first of</span>, R.V. marg. The ambiguity in the Heb. is similar to that mentioned in the preceding note. But the considerations urged in the first note on this verse are decisive for the rendering, <span class="ital">before</span>.

It is impossible to decide what was the exact view of the writer with regard to the wisdom of which he speaks so eloquently; but there can be no doubt that he was guided in his diction so as to give expression to the idea of him whom St. John calls the Word of God. The language used is not applicable to an impersonal quality, an abstract faculty of God. It describes the nature and office of a Person; and who that Person is we learn from the later Scriptures, which speak of Christ as the "Wisdom of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>) and "the Power of God and the Wisdom of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). If we confine our inquiry to the question - What was in the mind of the author when he indited this wonderful section concerning Wisdom? we shall fail to apprehend its true significance, and shall be disowning the influence of the Holy Spirit, which inspires all Scripture, which prompted the holy men who spake to utter words of which they knew not the full spiritual significance, and which could only be understood by subsequent revelation. There is, then, nothing forced or incongruous in seeing in this episode a portraiture of the Second Person of the blessed Trinity, the essential Wisdom of God personified, the Logos of later books, and of the gospel. This interpretation obtained universally in the Church in the earliest times, and has commended itself to the most learned and reverent of modern commentators. That much which was contained in their own utterances was unknown to the prophets of old, that they did not fully perceive the mysteries which they darkly enunciated, we learn from St. Peter,  who tells us that they who prophesied of the grace of Christ sought and searched diligently what the Spirit of God that was in them did point unto, and were shown that not unto themselves, but unto us, they ministered those things, secrets which angels themselves desire to look into (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10</a>, etc.). Wisdom as a human endowment, animating all intellectual and even physical powers; Wisdom as communicating to man moral excellence and piety; Wisdom as not only an attribute of God, but itself as the eternal thought of God; - under these aspects it is regarded in our book; but under and through all it is more or less personified. <span class="accented">Khochmah</span> is contrasted in the next chapter, not with an abstraction, but with an actual woman of impure life - a real, not an imaginary, antagonist. The personality of the latter intimates that of the former (see Liddon, 'Bampt. Lects.,' 2.). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord possessed me.</span> Great controversy has arisen about the word rendered "possessed." The verb used is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">kanah</span>), which means properly "to erect, set upright," also "to found, form" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-19.htm">Genesis 14:19, 22</a>), then "to acquire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-5.htm">Proverbs 4:5, 7</a>, etc.) or "to possess" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-32.htm">Proverbs 15:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8</a>). The Vulgate, Aquila, Theodotion, Symmachus, Venetian, give "possessed;" Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "made," and so Syriac. The Arians took the word in the sense of "created" (which, though supported by the LXX., it seems never to have had), and deduced therefrom the Son's inferiority to the Father - that he was made, not begotten from all eternity. Ben Sira more than once employs the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> in speaking of Wisdom's origin; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ecclus. 1:4, 9 Ecclus. 24:8. Opposing the heresy of the Arians, the Fathers generally adopted the rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, <span class="accented">possedit</span>, "possessed;" and even those who received the translation <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, explained it not of creating, but of appointing, thus: The Father set Wisdom over all created things, or made Wisdom to be the efficient cause of his creatures (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>). May we not say that the writer was guided to use a word which would express relation in a twofold sense? Wisdom is regarded either as the mind of God expressed in operation, or the Second Person of the Holy Trinity; and the verb thus signifies that God possesses in himself this essential Wisdom, and intimates likewise that Wisdom by eternal generation is a Divine Personality. St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>), before saying that the Word was God, affirms that "the Word was with God (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)." So we may assert that Solomon has arrived at the truth that Wisdom was <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, if he has left it for later revelation to declare that <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>. Whichever sense we assign to the verb on which the difficulty is supposed to hang, whether we take it as "possessed," "formed," or "acquired," we may safely assume that the idea conveyed to Christian minds is this - that Wisdom, existing eternally in the Godhead, was said to be "formed" or "brought forth" when it operated in creation, and when it assumed human nature. <span class="cmt_word">In the beginning of his way.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">in initio viarum suarum.</span> But the preposition "in" does not occur in the original; and the words may be bettor translated, "as the beginning of his way" (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the earliest revelation of his working. Wisdom, eternal and uncreated, first puts forth its energy in creation, then becomes incarnate, and is now called, "the Firstborn of all creation (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>); and, "When he bringeth in the Firstborn into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>). In the present clause, the ways of God are his works, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-14.htm">Job 26:14</a> and Job 40:19, where behemoth is called "chief among the ways of God" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>, where "ways" stands as a parallel to "works"). <span class="cmt_word">Before his works of old.</span> These words are better regarded (with Delitzsch) as a second parallel object, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">kedem</span>), translated "before," being not a preposition, but denoting previous existence. Hence we translate, "The foremost of his works of old;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the earliest revelation of his energy. There is a curious passage in the 'Book of Enoch,' ch. 42, which speaks of the personality and pre-existence of Wisdom, of her desire to dwell among men, frustrated by man's wickedness: "Wisdom found no place where she could dwell; therefore was her dwelling in heaven. Wisdom came forth in order to dwell among the sons of men, and found no habitation; then she returned to her place, and took her seat among the angels." We may add Wisd. 8:3, "In that she dwelleth with God (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>), she magnifieth her nobility." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>We may not explain the second clause of this verse: et ad ingenua impelluntur quicunque terrae imperant, for &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489; is adj. without such a verbal sense. But besides, &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; is not pred., for which it is not adapted, because, with the obscuring of its ethical signification (from &#1504;&#1491;&#1489;, to impel inwardly, viz., to noble conduct, particularly to liberality), it also denotes those who are noble only with reference to birth, and not to disposition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-8.htm">Isaiah 32:8</a>). Thus &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; is a fourth synonym for the highly exalted, and &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497; &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is the summary placing together of all kinds of dignity; for &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496; unites in itself references to government, administration of justice, and rule. &#1499;&#1500; is used, and not &#1493;&#1499;&#1500; - a so-called asyndeton summativum. Instead of &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; (lxx) there is found also the word &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; (Syr., Targ., Jerome, Graec. Venet., adopted by Norzi after Codd. and Neapol. 1487). But this word, if not derived from the conclusion of the preceding verse, is not needed by the text, and gives a summary which does not accord with that which is summed up (&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1512;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;); besides, the Scripture elsewhere calls God Himself &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1496; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a>). The Masoretic reading<p>(Note: If the Masoretes had read &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, then would they have added the remark &#1500;&#1497;&#1514; ("it does not further occur"), and inserted the expression in their Register of Expressions, which occurs but once, Masora finalis, p. 62.)<p>of most of the editions, which is also found in the Cod. Hillel (&#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1492;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497;)<p>(Note: One of the most ancient and celebrated Codd of the Heb. Scriptures, called Hillel from the name of the man who wrote it. Vid., Streack's Prolegomena, p. 112. It was written about a.d. 600.)<p>merits the preference. </body></html>
