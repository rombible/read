All prudence and skill are from the Lord. Through the redemption of Christ's precious blood, the riches of his grace abound in all wisdom and prudence. Man found out many inventions for ruin; God found one for our recovery. He hates pride and arrogance, evil ways and froward conversation; these render men unwilling to hear his humbling, awakening, holy instructions. True religion gives men the best counsel in all difficult cases, and helps to make their way plain. His wisdom makes all truly happy who receive it in the love of Christ Jesus. Seek him early, seek him earnestly, seek him before any thing else. Christ never said, Seek in vain. Those who love Christ, are such as have seen his loveliness, and have had his love shed abroad in their hearts; therefore they are happy. They shall be happy in this world, or in that which is beyond compare better. Wealth gotten by vanity will soon be diminished, but that which is well got, will wear well; and that which is well spent upon works of piety and charity, will be lasting. If they have not riches and honour in this world, they shall have that which is infinitely better. They shall be happy in the grace of God. Christ, by his Spirit, guides believers into all truth, and so leads them in the way of righteousness; and they walk after the Spirit. Also, they shall be happy in the glory of God hereafter. In Wisdom's promises, believers have goods laid up, not for days and years, but for eternity; her fruit therefore is better than gold.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gold - The "choice, fine gold" of margin reference.

This is said in allusion to the fruit that grows on trees, Wisdom, or Christ, being a tree of life; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>; and so he is compared to other trees, Sol 2:3. His "fruit" are the blessings of grace, such as redemption, reconciliation, pardon, justification, adoption, and eternal life; these are his by covenant, are procured by him, and are communicated from him; also the graces of his Spirit called fruits, as faith, hope, love, &amp;c. of which he is the author and object; and even good works, the fruits of his grace; they are done in virtue of union to him, by his strength, and are directed to his glory: and all these, especially his grace and the blessings of it, are preferable to the finest gold; they are more valuable as to their intrinsic worth and excellency; they are more useful and profitable, being for the good and welfare of immortal souls; and they are more satisfying and more lasting, and which cannot be obtained with such a corruptible thing as gold is; <p>and my revenue than choice silver; as the former word refers to fruits that grow on trees, this to such as spring from seed sown in the earth; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39</a>, where the same word is used as here, and is also rendered "revenue" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-13.htm">Jeremiah 12:13</a>; Christ himself is compared to seed, and so his word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a>; and the fruit or revenue thereof is the same as before: or else the allusion is to the profit arising from riches, from estates, and their annual rent; or from money put out to use, or improved by commerce, and so signifies the same with the gain and merchandise of wisdom; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a>.

With this verse begins a new series of thoughts raising themselves on the basis of the fundamental clause 13a. Wisdom says what she hates, and why she hates it:<p>13 "The fear of Jahve is to hate evil;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pride and arrogancy, and an evil way<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a deceitful mouth, do Ihate."<p>If the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>), then wisdom, personally considered, stands before all else that is to be said of her in a relation of homage or reverence toward God corresponding to the fear of God on the part of man; and if, as the premiss 13a shows, the fear of God has as its reverse side the hatred of evil, then there arises what Wisdom says in &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; (I hate) of herself. Instead of the n. actionis &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514; (hatred), formed in the same way with &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;, which, admitting the article, becomes a substantive, the author uses, in order that he might designate the predicate as such (Hitzig), rather the n. actionis &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514; as &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>. &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>, is equivalent to &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514; like &#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, the becoming dry, &#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;, the being able; cf. (Arab.) shanat, hating, mala&#770;t, well-being, k&#803;ara&#770;t, reading (Fl.). The evil which Wisdom hates is now particularized as, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>, the evil which Jahve hates. The virtue of all virtues is humility; therefore Wisdom hates, above all, self-exaltation in all its forms. The paronomasia &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; &#1493;&#1490;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (pride and haughtiness) expresses the idea in the whole of its contents and compass (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-6.htm">Isaiah 15:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>, and above at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>). &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; (from &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, the nominal form), that which is lofty  equals  pride, stands with &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-10.htm">Job 4:10</a>, &#1490;&#1489;&#1492;&#1468;, that which is high  equals  arrogance. There follows the viam mali, representing the sins of walk, i.e., of conduct, and os fullax (vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-12.htm">Proverbs 2:12</a>), the sins of the mouth. Hitzig rightly rejects the interpunctuation &#1512;&#1506;, and prefers &#1512;&#1506;. In consequence of this Dech (Tiphcha init.), &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; &#1514;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1514; have in Codd. and good editions the servants Asla and Illuj (vid., Baer's Torath Emeth, p. 11); Aben-Ezra and Moses Kimchi consider the Asla erroneously as disjunctive, and explain &#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497; by et os  equals  axioma meum, but Asla is conjunctive, and has after it the &#1514; raphatum. </body></html>
