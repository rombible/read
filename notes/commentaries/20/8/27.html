Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a> we have, "It is he that sitteth above the circle (<span class="accented">chug</span>) of the earth;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the vault of heaven that encircles the earth.

The Piel &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; expresses firm, constant action; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; means that she turns from this line of conduct on no side. &#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; is distinguished from &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, as ut possidendam tribuam from possidendam tribuendo; the former denotes the direction of the activity, the latter its nature and manner; both combine if we translate ita ut....<p>(Note: Biesenthal combines the etymologically obscure &#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; with &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;: to make to flow into, so that &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; denotes inheritance in contradistinction to acquisition; while &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, in contradistinction to &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492;, denotes the inheritance rather of many than of the individual.)<p>Regarding the origin of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>; it denotes the being founded, thus substantia, and appears here, like the word in mediaeval Latin and Romanic (Ital. sustanza, Span. substancia), and like &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; and &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;) in classic Greek, to denote possessions and goods. But since this use of the word does not elsewhere occur (therefore Hitzig explains &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1497;, I have it  equals  presto est), and here, where Wisdom speaks, &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; connects itself in thought with &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, it will at least denote real possession (as we also are wont to call not every kind of property, but only landed property, real possession), such possession as has real worth, and that not according to commercial exchange and price, but according to sound judgment, which applies a higher than the common worldly standard of worth. The Pasek between &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is designed to separate the two Jods from each other, and has, as a consequence, for &#1500;&#1492;&#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497; the accentuation with Tarcha and Mercha (vid., Accentssystem, vi. 4; cf. Torath Emeth, p. 17, 3). The carrying forward of the inf. with the finite, 21b, is as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-27.htm">Proverbs 1:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2</a>, and quite usual. </body></html>
