Indeed, it is impossible to join these two things together, the love of the world and the love of God, which is here implied in the love of wisdom. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-11 The will of God is made known by the works of creation, and by the consciences of men, but more clearly by Moses and the prophets. The chief difficulty is to get men to attend to instruction. Yet attention to the words of Christ, will guide the most ignorant into saving knowledge of the truth. Where there is an understanding heart, and willingness to receive the truth in love, wisdom is valued above silver and gold.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Excellent - literally, "princely things."

And nothing but the truth; and nothing more or less can be spoken by Wisdom, or Christ, who is truth itself; nothing else can come out of his mouth, or drop from his lips; all the doctrines of Christ are agreeable to the Scriptures of truth, and are what the Spirit of truth leads into; and the whole is called "the word of truth": there are many very particular and special truths, but the principal one is salvation by Jesus Christ; <p>and wickedness is an abomination to my lips; the sin of lying more especially, as opposed to truth; this is detestable to wisdom, what Christ never suffered his lips to utter; for no lie is of the truth, but of Satan the father of lies; and, as it is abhorred by Christ, it ought to be by all good men. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Another coordinate reason for attention. <span class="cmt_word">My mouth;</span> <span class="accented">chek</span>, "palate" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3</a>, where see note); the organ of speech. <span class="cmt_word">Shall speak truth;</span> <span class="accented">emeth</span> (see on Proverbs 3:3).

For as in the beginning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>., so also here in the end, he introduces Wisdom herself as speaking. There, her own testimony is delivered in contrast to the alluring voice of the deceiver; here, the daughter of Heaven in the highways inviting to come to her, is the contrast to the adulteress lurking in the streets, who is indeed not a personification, but a woman of flesh and blood, but yet at the same time as the incarnate &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; of worldly lust. He places opposite to her Wisdom, whose person is indeed not so sensibly perceptible, but who is nevertheless as real, coming near to men in a human way, and seeking to win them by her gifts.<p>1 Doth not Wisdom discourse,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Understanding cause her voice to be heard?<p>2 On the top of the high places in the way,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the midst of the way, she has placed herself.<p>3 By the side of the gates, at the exit of the city,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At the entrance to the doors, she calleth aloud.<p>As &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; points to that which is matter of fact, so &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; calls to a consideration of it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22</a>); the question before the reader is doubly justified with reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>. With &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, &#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; is interchanged, as e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1-6</a>; such names of wisdom are related to its principal name almost as &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503;, and the like, to &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;. In describing the scene, the author, as usual, heaps up synonyms which touch one another without coming together.</body></html>
