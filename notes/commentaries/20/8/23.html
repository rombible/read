I, a person, and not a quality; a person, and not a nature; the person of Christ as the Son of God, and not the human nature of Christ, which then did not exist; this phrase designs the ordination and constitution of Christ in his office as Mediator. So the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "I was ordained"; Christ was foreordained to be the Redeemer and Saviour of men, to be the propitiation for their sins, to be the head of the church, and the Judge of the world. It intends likewise his inauguration into his office, and his investiture with it; and because anointing with oil was used in installing persons into the offices of prophet, priest, and king; hence Christ's instalment into his office as Mediator is here expressed by an anointing; for the words may be rendered, "I was anointed" (i); it takes in all that goes to his constitution as Mediator, his call, appointment, and investiture; and the whole of his office, every part and branch of it; and chiefly his kingly office, with reference to which the same word is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>; and so Gersom paraphrases it, <p>"and there were given to me power, dominion, and greatness;'' <p>all which suppose the eternity of his person; for had he not existed from everlasting, he could not have been set up, and anointed as Mediator, or invested with his office as such; <p>from the beginning, or ever the earth was; or from the first of the earth, or the original of it; that is, before all time, before the earth or anything was created; this further confirms the eternal existence of Christ's person, the antiquity of his office, the early provision of grace in him as Mediator for his people, and may lead to entertain high and honourable thoughts of him. <p>(i) "uncta sum", Cocceius, Michaelis, Schultens; "inuncta fui", Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{l}</span> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</span><p>(l) He declares the eternity of the Son of God, who was before all time, and ever present with the father.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">set up</span>] Gesenius renders <span class="ital">anointed</span> here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a>, where the same word occurs.

It is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>(<span class="accented">nasak</span>), in niph.; and it is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>, "I have set my King upon my holy hill." Both here and there it has been translated "anointed," which would make a noteworthy reference to Christ. But there  seems no proof that the word has this meaning. It signifies properly "to pour forth" (as of molten metal), then "to put down," "to appoint or establish." The versions recognize this. Thus the Septuagint, "he established (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) me;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ordinata sum</span>; Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>; Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; Venetian, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (comp. Ecclus. 1:9). So what is here said is that Wisdom was from everlasting exalted as ruler and disposer of all things. To express eternal relation, three synonymous terms are used. From <span class="accented">everlasting</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint, as Delitzsch notes, points back to infinite distance. <span class="cmt_word">From the beginning;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before the world was begun to be made; as St. John says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>), "In the beginning was the Word;" and Christ prays, "Glorify thou me with thine own self, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Or ever the earth was</span>.
