It is otherwise if &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; here meant magni (thus e.g., Ralbag, and recently Bertheau), and not multi; but &#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1506;&#1510;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; stand elsewhere in connection with each other in the signification many and numerous, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-18.htm">Psalm 35:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>. "Her slain" are those slain by her; the part. pass. is connected with the genitive of the actor, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>; cf. (Arab.) k&#803;atyl a&#770;lmh&#803;abbt, of one whom love kills (Fl.).

In 27a, &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; is not equivalent to &#1489;&#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; after <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-2.htm">Proverbs 8:2</a>, also not elliptical and equivalent to &#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497; &#1489;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;; the former is unnecessary, the latter is in no case established by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-7.htm">Psalm 45:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-13.htm">Ezra 10:13</a>, nor by <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-17.htm">2 Kings 23:17</a> (see, on the other hand, Philippi's Status Constructus, pp. 87-93). Rightly Hitzig has: her house forms a multiplicity of ways to hell, in so far as adultery leads by a diversity of ways to hell.

If one is once in her house, he may go in this or in that way, but surely his path is to destruction: it consists of many steps to hell, such as lead down (&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, fem. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-34.htm">Isaiah 37:34</a>, masc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>) to the extreme depths of death (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>, "chambers of the south"  equals  its remotest regions veiling themselves in the invisible); for &#1495;&#1491;&#1512; (Arab. khiddr) is the part of the tent or the house removed farthest back, and the most private (Fl.).
