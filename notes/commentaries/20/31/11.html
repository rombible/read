She is very careful to recommend herself to her husband's esteem and affection, to know his mind, and is willing that he rule over her. 1. She can be trusted, and he will leave such a wife to manage for him. He is happy in her. And she makes it her constant business to do him good. 2. She is one that takes pains in her duties, and takes pleasure in them. She is careful to fill up time, that none be lost. She rises early. She applies herself to the business proper for her, to women's business. She does what she does, with all her power, and trifles not. 3. She makes what she does turn to good account by prudent management. Many undo themselves by buying, without considering whether they can afford it. She provides well for her house. She lays up for hereafter. 4. She looks well to the ways of her household, that she may oblige all to do their duty to God and one another, as well as to her. 5. She is intent upon giving as upon getting, and does it freely and cheerfully. 6. She is discreet and obliging; every word she says, shows she governs herself by the rules of wisdom. She not only takes prudent measures herself, but gives prudent advice to others. The law of love and kindness is written in the heart, and shows itself in the tongue. Her heart is full of another world, even when her hands are most busy about this world. 7. Above all, she fears the Lord. Beauty recommends none to God, nor is it any proof of wisdom and goodness, but it has deceived many a man who made his choice of a wife by it. But the fear of God reigning in the heart, is the beauty of the soul; it lasts for ever. 8. She has firmness to bear up under crosses and disappointments. She shall reflect with comfort when she comes to be old, that she was not idle or useless when young. She shall rejoice in a world to come. She is a great blessing to her relations. If the fruit be good, the tree must have our good word. But she leaves it to her own works to praise her. Every one ought to desire this honour that cometh from God; and according to this standard we all ought to regulate our judgments. This description let all women daily study, who desire to be truly beloved and respected, useful and honourable. This passage is to be applied to individuals, but may it not also be applied to the church of God, which is described as a virtuous spouse? God by his grace has formed from among sinful men a church of true believers, to possess all the excellences here described.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No need of spoil - Better, no lack of gain, lack of honest gain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. heart &#8230; trust in her&#8212;He relies on her prudence and skill.<p>no need of spoil&#8212;does not lack profit or gain, especially, that obtained by the risk of war.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Doth safely trust in her, </span> for the prudent and faithful management of all his domestic affairs, which are committed to her care. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So that he shall have no need of spoil; </span> the sense is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Christ her Maker is her husband, who has asked her in marriage, and has betrothed her to himself in righteousness; and of whose chaste love, and inviolable attachment to him, he is fully satisfied, as well as of her fidelity in keeping what he commits unto her; he trusts her with his Gospel and ordinances, which she faithfully retains and observes; and with his children born in her, who are nursed up at her side, to whom she gives the breasts of ordinances, bears them on her sides, and dandles them on her knees, as a tender and careful mother does, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-4.htm">Isaiah 60:4</a>; <p>so that he shall have no need of spoil; he shall never want any; by means of the word preached in her, prey and spoil shall be taken out of the hands of the mighty, and he shall divide the spoil with them; or have souls snatched out of the hands of Satan, and translated into his kingdom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>. The Septuagint version understands it of the virtuous woman, and not of her husband; "such an one as she shall not want good spoils"; now, prey or spoil sometimes signifies food, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-5.htm">Psalm 111:5</a>; and so Jarchi interprets it here; and then the sense is, she shall not want spiritual provisions; she shall have plenty of them from her husband, who reposes such confidence in her; or shall not want excellent treasures, as the Arabic version, which also understands it of her; such are the word and ordinances, and particularly precious promises, which are more rejoicing than a great spoil, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-162.htm">Psalm 119:162</a>; and so Ambrose interprets (y) it of the church, who needs no spoils because she abounds with them, even with the spoils of the world, and of the devil. <p>(y) Enarrat. in loc. p. 1099. tom. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> spoil.</span><p>(h) He will not need to use any unlawful means to gain his living.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">doth safely trust in her</span>] Or, <span class="ital">trusteth in her</span>, R.V. “The very first item in the catalogue of good qualities is the rarest of all: ‘the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her.’ The husband in nine cases out of every ten does not feel very confident that ‘she will do him good and not evil,’ and he sets a jealous watch over her, and places every valuable article under lock and key.

(as e.g., also Mhlau); but in this &#1488;&#1500; is not rightly rendered, which indeed is at times only an &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;, spoken with close interest, but yet first of all, especially in such paraenetic connection as here, it is a dissuasive &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;. But now &#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; or &#1500;&#1488; &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>, signifies: it is not the part of kings, it does not become them to drink, which may also be turned into a dissuasive form: let it not be the part of kings to drink, let them not have any business therewith, as if it belonged to their calling; according to which Fleischer renders: Absit a regibus, Lemuel, absit a regibus potare vinum. The clearer expression &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1500;, instead of &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1500;, is, after Bttcher, occasioned by this, that the name is here in the vocative; perhaps rather by this, that the meaning of the name: consecrated to God, belonging to God, must be placed in contrast to the descending to low, sensual lust. Both times we write &#1488;&#1500; &#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; with the orthophonic Dagesh<p>(Note: Vid., Luth. Zeitschrift, 1863, p. 413. It is the rule, according to which, with Ben-Asher, it is to be written &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;.)<p>in the &#1500; following &#1500;, and without the recompensative Dagesh, the want of which is in a certain measure covered by the Metheg (vid., Norzi). Regarding the inf. constr. &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493; (cf. &#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-16.htm">Proverbs 16:16</a>), vid., Gesen. 75, Anm. 2; and regarding the sequence of accents here necessary, &#1488;&#1500; &#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1470;&#1497;&#1497;&#1503; (not Mercha, Dechi, Athnach, for Dechi would be here contrary to rule), vid., Thorath Emeth, p. 22 6, p. 43 7.<p>In 4b nothing is to be gained from the Cheth&#305;&#770;b &#1488;&#1493;. There is not a substantive &#1488;&#1493;, desire, the constr. of which would here have to be read, not &#1488;&#1493; (Umbreit, Gesenius), but &#1488;&#1493;, after the form &#1511;&#1493; (Maurer); and why did the author not write &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;? But the particle &#1488;&#1493; does not here also fall in with the connection; for if &#1488;&#1493; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512; connect itself with &#1497;&#1497;&#1503; (Hitzig, Ewald, and others), then it would drag disagreeably, and we would have here a spiritless classification of things unadvisable for kings. Bttcher therefore sees in this &#1488;&#1493; the remains of the obliterated &#1505;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;; a corrector must then have transformed the &#1493;&#1488; which remained into &#1488;&#1493;. But before one ventures on such conjectures, the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1488;&#1497; [where?] must be tried. Is it the abbreviated &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; (Herzog's Real-Wrterbuch, xiv. 712)? Certainly not, because &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1512;&#1493;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512; would mean: and the princes, or rulers (vid., regarding &#1512;&#1493;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15</a>), have no mead, which is inconsistent. But &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; does not abbreviate itself into &#1488;&#1497;, but into &#1488;&#1497;. Not &#1488;&#1497;, but &#1488;&#1497;, is in Heb., as well as in Ethiop., the word with which negative adjectives such as &#1488;&#1497; &#1504;&#1511;&#1497;, not innocent, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-30.htm">Job 22:30</a>, and in later Heb. also, negative sentences, such as &#1488;&#1497; &#1488;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;: it is not possible, are formed.<p>(Note: The author of the Comm. &#1506;&#1496;&#1512;&#1514; &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; to the &#1488;&#1512;&#1495; &#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, c. 6, Geiger and others would read &#1488;&#1497;, because &#1488;&#1497; is abbreviated from &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;. But why not from &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>? The traditional expression is &#1488;&#1497;; and Elias Levita in the Tishbi, as also Baer in the Siddur Abodath Jisrael, are right in defending it against that innovation.)<p>Therefore Mhlau vocalizes &#1488;&#1497;, and thinks that the author used this word for &#1488;&#1500;, so as not to repeat this word for the third time. But how is that possible? &#1488;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512; signifies either: not mead, or: there is not mead; and both afford, for the passage before us, no meaning. Is, then, the Ker&#305;&#770; &#1488;&#1497; truly so unsuitable? Indeed, to explain: how came intoxicating drink to rulers! is inadmissible, since &#1488;&#1497; always means only ubi (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-9.htm">Genesis 4:9</a>); not, like the Ethiop. aite&#770;, also quomodo. But the question ubi temetum, as a question of desire, fits the connection, whether the sentence means: non decet principibus dicere (Ahron b. Josef supplies &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;) ubi temetum, or: absit a principibus quaerere ubi temetum (Fleischer), which, from our view of 4a, we prefer. There is in reality nothing to be supplied; but as 4a says that the drinking of wine ought not to characterize kings, so 4b, that "Where is mead?" (i.e., this eager inquiry after mead) ought not to characterize rulers.<p>(Note: The translation of Jerome, quia nullum secretum est ubi regnat ebrietas (as if the words were &#1500;&#1497;&#1514; &#1512;&#1494;&#1488; &#1488;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;), corresponds to the proverb: &#1504;&#1499;&#1504;&#1505; &#1497;&#1497;&#1503; &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; :b, when the wine goes in the secret comes out; or, which is the same thing: if one adds &#1497;&#1497;&#1503; ( equals  70), &#1505;&#1493;&#1491; ( equals  70) comes out.)<p>Why not? <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-5.htm">Proverbs 31:5</a> says. That the prince, being a slave to drink, may not forget the &#1502;&#1495;&#1511;&#1468;&#1511;, i.e., that which has been made and has become &#1495;&#1511;, thus that which is lawfully right, and may not alter the righteous cause of the miserable, who cry against their oppressors, i.e., may not handle falsely the facts of the case, and give judgment contrary to them.<p>continued...</body></html>
