Those who are grown up, should often call to mind the good teaching they received when children. The many awful instances of promising characters who have been ruined by vile women, and love of wine, should warn every one to avoid these evils. Wine is to be used for want or medicine. Every creature of God is good, and wine, though abused, has its use. By the same rule, due praise and consolation should be used as cordials to the dejected and tempted, not administered to the confident and self-sufficient. All in authority should be more carefully temperate even than other men; and should be protectors of those who are unable or afraid to plead their own cause. Our blessed Lord did not decline the bitterest dregs of the cup of sorrow put into his hands; but he puts the cup of consolation into the hands of his people, and causes those to rejoice who are in the deepest distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Some read: "nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink?"

A certain woman, being undeservedly condemned by Philip king of Macedon, when drunk, said, <p>"I would appeal to Philip, but it shall be when he is sober;'' <p>which aroused him; and, more diligently examining the cause, he gave, a more righteous sentence (h). <p>(g) "mutet", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Mercerus, Cocceius, Gejerus, Michaelis; "demutet", Schultens.
