Those who are grown up, should often call to mind the good teaching they received when children. The many awful instances of promising characters who have been ruined by vile women, and love of wine, should warn every one to avoid these evils. Wine is to be used for want or medicine. Every creature of God is good, and wine, though abused, has its use. By the same rule, due praise and consolation should be used as cordials to the dejected and tempted, not administered to the confident and self-sufficient. All in authority should be more carefully temperate even than other men; and should be protectors of those who are unable or afraid to plead their own cause. Our blessed Lord did not decline the bitterest dregs of the cup of sorrow put into his hands; but he puts the cup of consolation into the hands of his people, and causes those to rejoice who are in the deepest distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Some read: "nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink?"

It is not fit for them, it is very unbecoming them; it is dishonourable to them, to such as Lemuel was, or was likely to be; or far be it from kings, let no such thing be do ne by them, nor by thee; <p>it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink; it is lawful for kings to drink wine in a moderate manner, and for princes, counsellors, and judges, to drink strong drink; meaning not such as is made of malt, which in those times was not used; but of honey, dates, pomegranates, and such like things; but then it was very unbecoming for either of them to drink any of these to excess; it is very disgraceful to any man to drink immoderately, to make a beast of himself, and much more a king or judge, who, of all men, ought to be grave and sober; both that they may perform their office well, and maintain the grandeur and dignity of it, which otherwise would become useless and despicable, yea, pernicious, as follows. Solomon, notwithstanding this advice, gave himself unto wine as well as women, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:3</a>. The Targum is, <p>"take care of kings, O Lemuel, of kings who drink wine, and of princes that drink strong drink.'' <p>So the Syriac version, keep no company with them, nor follow their example; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:17</a>; The last clause may be rendered, "nor for princes to say, where is strong drink" (d)? where is it to be had? where is the best? as drunkards do; which is according to the marginal reading; but the "Cetib", or writing, is  "or" (e); but some render it as a noun, "the desire of strong drink" (f): it does not become princes to covet it. <p>(d)  "ubi sechar?"

(see on Proverbs 20:1; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-23.htm">Job 15:23</a>). The evils of intemperance, flagrant enough in the case of a private person, are greatly enhanced in the case of a king, whose misdeeds may affect a whole community, as the next verse intimates. St. Jerome reads differently, translating, "Because there is no secret where drunkenness reigns." This is in accordance with the proverb, "When wine goes in the secret comes out;" and, "Where drink enters, wisdom departs;" and again, "Quod latet in mente sobrii, hoc natat in ore ebrii." Septuagint, "The powerful are irascible, but let them not drink wine." "Drunkenness," says Jeremy Taylor ('Holy Living,' ch. 3, &sect; 2), "opens all the sanctuaries of nature, and discovers the nakedness of the soul, all its weaknesses and follies; it multiplies sins and discovers them; it makes a man incapable of being a private friend or a public counsellor. It taketh a man's soul into slavery and imprisonment more than any vice whatsoever, because it disarms a man of all his reason and his wisdom, whereby he might be cured, and, therefore, commonly it grows upon him with age; a drunkard being still more a fool and less a man." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Another numerical proverb with the cipher 4  equals  3 + 1:<p>29 Three things are of stately walk,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And four of stately going:<p>30 The lion, the hero among beasts,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And that turneth back before nothing;<p>31 The swift-loined, also the goat;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a king with whom is the calling out of the host.<p>Regarding &#1492;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489; with inf. following (the segolated n. actionis &#1510;&#1506;&#1491; is of equal force with an inf.), vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>.<p>(Note: In 29a, after Norzi, &#1502;&#1497;&#1496;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;, and in 29b, &#1502;&#1497;&#1496;&#1489;&#1497;, is to be written, and this is required by the little Masora to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-31.htm">1 Samuel 25:31</a>, the great, to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a>, and also the Erfurt little Masora to the passage before us.)<p>The relation of the members of the sentence in 30a is like that in 25a and 26a: subj. and apposit., which there, as here, is continued in a verbal clause which appears to us as relative. It deserves to be here remarked that &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as the name for a lion, occurs only here and at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-11.htm">Job 4:11</a>, and in the description of the Sinai wilderness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>; in Arab. it is layth, Aram. &#1500;&#1497;&#1514;, and belongs to the Arameo-Arab. dialect of this language; the lxx and Syr. translate it "the young lion;" the Venet. excellently, by the epic &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; has the article only to denote the genus, viz., of the beasts, and particularly the four-footed beasts. What is said in 30b (cf. with the expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-22.htm">Job 39:22</a>) is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-4.htm">Isaiah 30:4</a>. The two other beasts which distinguish themselves by their stately going are in 31a only briefly named. But we are not in the condition of the readers of this Book of Proverbs, who needed only to hear the designation &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; at once to know what beast was meant. Certainly &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;, as the name for a beast, is not altogether unknown in the post-bibl. Heb. "In the days of Rabbi Chija (the great teacher who came from Babylon to the Academy of Sepphoris), as is narrated in Bereschith rabba, sect. 65, a zarzir flew to the land of Israel, and it was brought to him with the question whether it were eatable. Go, said he, place it on the roof! Then came an Egyptian raven and lighted down beside it. See, said Chija, it is unclean, for it belongs to the genus of the ravens, which is unclean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>). From this circumstance there arose the proverb: The raven goes to the zarzir because it belongs to his own tribe."<p>(Note: This "like draws to like" in the form: "not in vain goes the raven to the zarzir, it belongs just to its own tribe," came to be often employed, Chullin 65a, Baba Kamma 92b. Plantavitius has it, Tendlau more at large, Sprichwrter, u.s.w., Nr. 577.)<p>Also the Jer. Rosch ha-schane, Halacha 3: "It is the manner of the world that one seeks to assist his zarzir, and another his zarzir, to obtain the victory;" and Midrash Echa v. 1, according to which it is the custom of the world, that one who has a large and a little zarzir in his house, is wont to treat the little one sparingly, so that in the case of the large one being killed, he might not need to buy another. According to this, the zarzir is a pugnacious animal, which also the proverb Bereschith rabba, c. 75, confirms: two zarzir do not sleep on one board; and one makes use of his for contests like cock-fights. According to this, the &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; is a bird, and that of the species of the raven; after Rashi, the tourneau, the starling, which is confirmed by the Arab. zurzur (vulgar Arab. zarzur), the common name of starlings (cf. Syr. zarzizo, under zrz of Castelli). But for the passage before us, we cannot regard this as important, for why is the starling fully named &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;? To this question Kimchi has already remarked that he knows no answer for it. Only, perhaps, the grave magpie (corvus pica), strutting with upraised tail, might be called succinctus lumbos, if &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; can at all be used here of a bird. At the earliest, this might possibly be used of a cock, which the later Heb. named directly &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, because of its manly demeanour; most old translators so understand it. The lxx translates, omitting the loins, by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, according to which the Syr. and Targ.: like the cock which struts about proudly among the hens;<p>(Note: Regarding the Targum Text, vid., Levy under &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488; and &#1494;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;. The expression &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1494;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494; (who is girded, and shows himself as such) is not unsuitable.)<p>Aquila and Theodotion: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;) &#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; The Quinta: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; Jezome: gallus succinctus lumbos. S&#803;ars&#803;ar (not s&#803;irs&#803;ir, as Hitzig vocalizes) is in Arab. a name for a cock, from s&#803;ars&#803;ara, to crow, an onomatopoeia. But the Heb. &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;, as the name of a bird, signifies, as the Talmud proves on the ground of that history, not a cock, but a bird of the raven order, whether a starling, a crow, or a magpie. And if this name of a corvinus is formed from the onomatopoeia &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1512;, the weaker form of that (Arab.) s&#803;ars&#803;ar, then &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which, for &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;, requires the verbal root &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;, to girdle, is not wholly appropriate; and how strangely would the three animals be mingled together, if between &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1514;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, the two four-footed animals, a bird were placed! If, as is to be expected, the "Lendenumgrtete" [the one girded about the loins  equals  &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;] be a four-footed animal, then it lies near, with C. B. Michaelis and Ziegler, after Ludolf's<p>continued...</body></html>
