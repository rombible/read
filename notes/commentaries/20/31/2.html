Those who are grown up, should often call to mind the good teaching they received when children. The many awful instances of promising characters who have been ruined by vile women, and love of wine, should warn every one to avoid these evils. Wine is to be used for want or medicine. Every creature of God is good, and wine, though abused, has its use. By the same rule, due praise and consolation should be used as cordials to the dejected and tempted, not administered to the confident and self-sufficient. All in authority should be more carefully temperate even than other men; and should be protectors of those who are unable or afraid to plead their own cause. Our blessed Lord did not decline the bitterest dregs of the cup of sorrow put into his hands; but he puts the cup of consolation into the hands of his people, and causes those to rejoice who are in the deepest distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The repetitions are emphatic; expressive of anxious love.<p>Son of my vows - Like Samuel, and Samson, the child often asked for in prayer, the prayer ratified by a vow of dedication.

What shall I call thee? though thou art a king, can I address thee in more suitable language, or use a more endearing appellative than this, and what follows? permit me, thy mother, to speak unto thee as my son: and what shall I say to thee? I want words, I want wisdom; O that I knew what to say to thee, that would be proper and profitable; or what is it I am about to say to thee? things of the greatest moment and importance, and therefore listen to me; and so the manner of speaking is designed to excite attention: or what shall I ask of thee? no part of thy kingdom, or any share in the government of it; only this favour, to avoid the sins unbecoming a prince, and to do the duty of a king, later mentioned. The Targum and Syriac version represent her as exclaiming, reproving, and threatening; as, Alas my son! is this the life thou designest to live, to give up thyself to wine and women? fie upon it, my son, is this becoming thy birth, education, and dignity? is this the fruit of all the pains I have taken in bringing thee up? consider the unbecoming part thou art acting; <p>and what, the son of my womb? whom I bore in sorrow, brought forth in pain, and took so much care and trouble to bring up in a religious way, and form for usefulness in church and state? not an adopted son, but my own flesh and blood; and therefore what I say must be thought to proceed from pure affection to thee, and solely for thy good; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>; <p>and what, the son of my vows? whom I asked of God, and promised to give up to him again, and did; for which reason she might call him Lemuel, as Hannah called her son Samuel, for a like reason, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-28.htm">1 Samuel 1:28</a>; a son for whom she had put up many prayers, for his temporal and spiritual good; and on whose account she had made many vows, promises, and resolutions, that she would do so and so, should she be so happy as to bring him into the world, and bring him up to man's estate, and see him settled on the throne of Israel. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">What, my son? and what, the son of <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</span><p>(c) By this often repetition of one thing, she declares her motherly affection.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">What</span>] This word thrice repeated finds its sufficient explanation in the yearning earnestness of a mother’s heart.

It deserves to be here remarked that &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as the name for a lion, occurs only here and at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-11.htm">Job 4:11</a>, and in the description of the Sinai wilderness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>; in Arab. it is layth, Aram. &#1500;&#1497;&#1514;, and belongs to the Arameo-Arab. dialect of this language; the lxx and Syr. translate it "the young lion;" the Venet. excellently, by the epic &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; has the article only to denote the genus, viz., of the beasts, and particularly the four-footed beasts. What is said in 30b (cf. with the expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-22.htm">Job 39:22</a>) is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-4.htm">Isaiah 30:4</a>. The two other beasts which distinguish themselves by their stately going are in 31a only briefly named. But we are not in the condition of the readers of this Book of Proverbs, who needed only to hear the designation &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; at once to know what beast was meant. Certainly &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;, as the name for a beast, is not altogether unknown in the post-bibl. Heb. "In the days of Rabbi Chija (the great teacher who came from Babylon to the Academy of Sepphoris), as is narrated in Bereschith rabba, sect. 65, a zarzir flew to the land of Israel, and it was brought to him with the question whether it were eatable. Go, said he, place it on the roof! Then came an Egyptian raven and lighted down beside it. See, said Chija, it is unclean, for it belongs to the genus of the ravens, which is unclean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>). From this circumstance there arose the proverb: The raven goes to the zarzir because it belongs to his own tribe."<p>(Note: This "like draws to like" in the form: "not in vain goes the raven to the zarzir, it belongs just to its own tribe," came to be often employed, Chullin 65a, Baba Kamma 92b. Plantavitius has it, Tendlau more at large, Sprichwrter, u.s.w., Nr. 577.)<p>Also the Jer. Rosch ha-schane, Halacha 3: "It is the manner of the world that one seeks to assist his zarzir, and another his zarzir, to obtain the victory;" and Midrash Echa v. 1, according to which it is the custom of the world, that one who has a large and a little zarzir in his house, is wont to treat the little one sparingly, so that in the case of the large one being killed, he might not need to buy another. According to this, the zarzir is a pugnacious animal, which also the proverb Bereschith rabba, c. 75, confirms: two zarzir do not sleep on one board; and one makes use of his for contests like cock-fights. According to this, the &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; is a bird, and that of the species of the raven; after Rashi, the tourneau, the starling, which is confirmed by the Arab. zurzur (vulgar Arab. zarzur), the common name of starlings (cf. Syr. zarzizo, under zrz of Castelli). But for the passage before us, we cannot regard this as important, for why is the starling fully named &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;? To this question Kimchi has already remarked that he knows no answer for it. Only, perhaps, the grave magpie (corvus pica), strutting with upraised tail, might be called succinctus lumbos, if &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; can at all be used here of a bird. At the earliest, this might possibly be used of a cock, which the later Heb. named directly &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, because of its manly demeanour; most old translators so understand it. The lxx translates, omitting the loins, by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, according to which the Syr. and Targ.: like the cock which struts about proudly among the hens;<p>(Note: Regarding the Targum Text, vid., Levy under &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488; and &#1494;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;. The expression &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1494;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494; (who is girded, and shows himself as such) is not unsuitable.)<p>Aquila and Theodotion: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;) &#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; The Quinta: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; Jezome: gallus succinctus lumbos. S&#803;ars&#803;ar (not s&#803;irs&#803;ir, as Hitzig vocalizes) is in Arab. a name for a cock, from s&#803;ars&#803;ara, to crow, an onomatopoeia. But the Heb. &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;, as the name of a bird, signifies, as the Talmud proves on the ground of that history, not a cock, but a bird of the raven order, whether a starling, a crow, or a magpie. And if this name of a corvinus is formed from the onomatopoeia &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1512;, the weaker form of that (Arab.) s&#803;ars&#803;ar, then &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which, for &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;, requires the verbal root &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;, to girdle, is not wholly appropriate; and how strangely would the three animals be mingled together, if between &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1514;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, the two four-footed animals, a bird were placed! If, as is to be expected, the "Lendenumgrtete" [the one girded about the loins  equals  &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;] be a four-footed animal, then it lies near, with C.
