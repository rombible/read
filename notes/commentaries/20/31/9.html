Those who are grown up, should often call to mind the good teaching they received when children. The many awful instances of promising characters who have been ruined by vile women, and love of wine, should warn every one to avoid these evils. Wine is to be used for want or medicine. Every creature of God is good, and wine, though abused, has its use. By the same rule, due praise and consolation should be used as cordials to the dejected and tempted, not administered to the confident and self-sufficient. All in authority should be more carefully temperate even than other men; and should be protectors of those who are unable or afraid to plead their own cause. Our blessed Lord did not decline the bitterest dregs of the cup of sorrow put into his hands; but he puts the cup of consolation into the hands of his people, and causes those to rejoice who are in the deepest distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In contrast with the two besetting sins of Eastern monarchs stands their one great duty, to give help to those who had no other helper.<p>Such as are appointed to destruction - literally, "children of bereavement," with the sense, either, as in the text, of those "destined to be bereaved of life or goods," or of "bereaved or fatherless children." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8, 9.

Hiph.  equals  &#1500;&#1492;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17</a>), according to which we are to translate: viasque tuas ad perdendos reges (ne dirige), by which, as Fleischer formulates the twofold possibility, it may either be said: direct not thy effort to this result, to destroy neighbouring kings - viz. by wars of invasion (properly, to wipe them away from the table of existence, as the Arabs say) - or: do not that by which kings are overthrown; i.e., with special reference to Lemuel, act not so that thou thyself must thereby be brought to ruin. But the warning against vengeful, rapacious, and covetous propensity to war (thus Jerome, so that Venet. after Kimchi: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, C. B. Michaelis, and earlier, Gesenius) does not stand well as parallel with the warning against giving his bodily and mental strength to women, i.e., expending it on them. But another explanation: direct not thy ways to the destruction of kings, i.e., toward that which destroys kings (Elster); or, as Luther translates: go not in the way wherein kings destroy themselves - puts into the words a sense which the author cannot have had in view; for the individualizing expression would then be generalized in the most ambiguous way. Thus &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; will be a name for women, parallel to &#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;. So far the translation of the Targum: &#1500;&#1489;&#1504;&#1514; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, filiabus (&#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1492;&#1514;?) regum, lies under a right supposition. But the designation is not thus general. Schultens explains catapultis regum after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-9.htm">Ezekiel 26:9</a>; but, inasmuch as he takes this as a figure of those who lay siege to the hearts of men, he translates: expugnatricibus regum, for he regards &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; as the plur. of &#1502;&#1495;&#1492;, a particip. noun, which he translates by deletor. The connecting form of the fem. plur. of this &#1502;&#1495;&#1492; might certainly be &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (cf. &#1502;&#1494;&#1497;, from &#1502;&#1494;&#1492;), but &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; ought to be changed into '&#1493;&#1490;&#1493; '&#1500;&#1501;; for one will not appeal to anomalies, such as '&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>; '&#1499;&#1468;&#1490;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a>; '&#1500;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-19.htm">Lamentations 1:19</a>; or '&#1493;&#1490;&#1493; '&#1492;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-24.htm">1 Kings 14:24</a>, to save the Pathach of &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, which, as we saw, proceeds from an altogether different understanding of the word. But if '&#1500;&#1501; is to be changed into '&#1500;&#1501;, then one must go further, since for &#1502;&#1495;&#1492; not an active but a conditional meaning is to be assumed, and we must write &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, in favour of which Fleischer as well as Gesenius decides: et ne committe consilia factaque tua iis quae reges perdunt, regum pestibus. Ewald also favours the change &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, for he renders &#1502;&#1495;&#1492; as a denom. of &#1502;&#1495;, marrow: those who enfeeble kings, in which Kamphausen follows him. Mhlau goes further; he gives the privative signification, to enfeeble, to the Piel &#1502;&#1495;&#1492;  equals  makhakha (cf. Herzog's Real-Wrterb. xiv. 712), which is much more probable, and proposes &#1500;&#1502;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;: iis quae vires enervant regum. But we can appropriately, with Nldeke, adhere to &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, deletricibus (perditricibus), for by this change the parallelism is satisfied; and that &#1502;&#1495;&#1492; may be used, with immediate reference to men, of entire and total destruction, is sufficiently established by such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-7.htm">Genesis 6:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/21-17.htm">Judges 21:17</a>, if any proof is at all needed for it. Regarding the lxx and those misled by it, who, by &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;, 4a, think on the Aram. &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;, vid., Mhlau, p. 53.<p>(Note: Also Hitzig's Blinzlerinnen [women who ogle or leer  equals  seductive courtesans] and Bttcher's Streichlerinnen [caressers, viz., of kings] are there rejected, as they deserve to be.)<p>But the Syr. has an idea worthy of the discourse, who translates epulis regum without our needing, with Mhlau, to charge him with dreaming of &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; in &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;. Perhaps that is true; but perhaps by &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; he thought of &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; (from &#1502;&#1492;, the particip. adj. of &#1502;&#1495;&#1495;): do not direct thy ways to rich food (morsels), such as kings love and can have. By this reading, 3b would mediate the transition to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-4.htm">Proverbs 31:4</a>; and that the mother refers to the immorality, the unseemliness, and the dangers of a large harem, only in one brief word (3a), cannot seem strange, much rather it may be regarded as a sign of delicacy. But so much the more badly does &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1498; accord with &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;. Certainly one goes to a banquet, for one finds leisure for it; but of one who himself is a king, it is not said that he should not direct his ways to a king's dainties. But if &#1500;&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; refers to the whole conduct of the king, the warning is, that he should not regulate his conduct in dependence on the love and the government of women. But whoever will place himself amid the revelry of lust, is wont to intoxicate himself with ardent spirits; and he who is thus intoxicated, is in danger of giving reins to the beast within him. </body></html>
