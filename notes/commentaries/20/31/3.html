Those who are grown up, should often call to mind the good teaching they received when children. The many awful instances of promising characters who have been ruined by vile women, and love of wine, should warn every one to avoid these evils. Wine is to be used for want or medicine. Every creature of God is good, and wine, though abused, has its use. By the same rule, due praise and consolation should be used as cordials to the dejected and tempted, not administered to the confident and self-sufficient. All in authority should be more carefully temperate even than other men; and should be protectors of those who are unable or afraid to plead their own cause. Our blessed Lord did not decline the bitterest dregs of the cup of sorrow put into his hands; but he puts the cup of consolation into the hands of his people, and causes those to rejoice who are in the deepest distress.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To that which destroyeth - The temptations of the harem were then, as now, the curse of all Eastern kingdoms. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-9.

It deserves to be here remarked that &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as the name for a lion, occurs only here and at <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/4-11.htm">Job 4:11</a>, and in the description of the Sinai wilderness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>; in Arab. it is layth, Aram. &#1500;&#1497;&#1514;, and belongs to the Arameo-Arab. dialect of this language; the lxx and Syr. translate it "the young lion;" the Venet. excellently, by the epic &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492; has the article only to denote the genus, viz., of the beasts, and particularly the four-footed beasts. What is said in 30b (cf. with the expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-22.htm">Job 39:22</a>) is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-4.htm">Isaiah 30:4</a>. The two other beasts which distinguish themselves by their stately going are in 31a only briefly named. But we are not in the condition of the readers of this Book of Proverbs, who needed only to hear the designation &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; at once to know what beast was meant. Certainly &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;, as the name for a beast, is not altogether unknown in the post-bibl. Heb. "In the days of Rabbi Chija (the great teacher who came from Babylon to the Academy of Sepphoris), as is narrated in Bereschith rabba, sect. 65, a zarzir flew to the land of Israel, and it was brought to him with the question whether it were eatable. Go, said he, place it on the roof! Then came an Egyptian raven and lighted down beside it. See, said Chija, it is unclean, for it belongs to the genus of the ravens, which is unclean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>). From this circumstance there arose the proverb: The raven goes to the zarzir because it belongs to his own tribe."<p>(Note: This "like draws to like" in the form: "not in vain goes the raven to the zarzir, it belongs just to its own tribe," came to be often employed, Chullin 65a, Baba Kamma 92b. Plantavitius has it, Tendlau more at large, Sprichwrter, u.s.w., Nr. 577.)<p>Also the Jer. Rosch ha-schane, Halacha 3: "It is the manner of the world that one seeks to assist his zarzir, and another his zarzir, to obtain the victory;" and Midrash Echa v. 1, according to which it is the custom of the world, that one who has a large and a little zarzir in his house, is wont to treat the little one sparingly, so that in the case of the large one being killed, he might not need to buy another. According to this, the zarzir is a pugnacious animal, which also the proverb Bereschith rabba, c. 75, confirms: two zarzir do not sleep on one board; and one makes use of his for contests like cock-fights. According to this, the &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; is a bird, and that of the species of the raven; after Rashi, the tourneau, the starling, which is confirmed by the Arab. zurzur (vulgar Arab. zarzur), the common name of starlings (cf. Syr. zarzizo, under zrz of Castelli). But for the passage before us, we cannot regard this as important, for why is the starling fully named &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;? To this question Kimchi has already remarked that he knows no answer for it. Only, perhaps, the grave magpie (corvus pica), strutting with upraised tail, might be called succinctus lumbos, if &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; can at all be used here of a bird. At the earliest, this might possibly be used of a cock, which the later Heb. named directly &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, because of its manly demeanour; most old translators so understand it. The lxx translates, omitting the loins, by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, according to which the Syr. and Targ.: like the cock which struts about proudly among the hens;<p>(Note: Regarding the Targum Text, vid., Levy under &#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1488; and &#1494;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;. The expression &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1494;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1494; (who is girded, and shows himself as such) is not unsuitable.)<p>Aquila and Theodotion: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;) &#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; The Quinta: &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; Jezome: gallus succinctus lumbos. S&#803;ars&#803;ar (not s&#803;irs&#803;ir, as Hitzig vocalizes) is in Arab. a name for a cock, from s&#803;ars&#803;ara, to crow, an onomatopoeia. But the Heb. &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;, as the name of a bird, signifies, as the Talmud proves on the ground of that history, not a cock, but a bird of the raven order, whether a starling, a crow, or a magpie. And if this name of a corvinus is formed from the onomatopoeia &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1512;, the weaker form of that (Arab.) s&#803;ars&#803;ar, then &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, which, for &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;, requires the verbal root &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;, to girdle, is not wholly appropriate; and how strangely would the three animals be mingled together, if between &#1500;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1514;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, the two four-footed animals, a bird were placed! If, as is to be expected, the "Lendenumgrtete" [the one girded about the loins  equals  &#1494;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;] be a four-footed animal, then it lies near, with C.
