The wisest course is, to look to God, and seek the favour of the Ruler of rulers; for every creature is that to us which God makes it to be. 27. The just man abhors the sins of the wicked, and shuns their company. Christ exposed the wickedness of men, yet prayed for the wicked when they were crucifying him. Hatred to sin in ourselves and others, is a needful branch of the Christian temper.

A variation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-6.htm">Proverbs 19:6</a>. There are numbers who are always trying, by means fair or surreptitious, to curry favour with a great man who has anything to bestow (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-24.htm">1 Kings 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-12.htm">Psalm 45:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But every man's judgment cometh from the Lord.</span> The real and only reliable judgment comes, not from an earthly prince (who may be prejudiced and is certainly fallible), but from the Lord, whose approval or disapproval is final and indisputable. Therefore one should seek to please him rather than any man, however great and powerful (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-4.htm">Isaiah 49:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>20 Seest thou a man hasty in his words?<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fool hath more hope than he.<p>Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-12.htm">Proverbs 26:12</a>. Such an one has blocked up against himself the path to wisdom, which to the fool, i.e., to the ingenuous, stands open; the former is perfect, of the latter something may yet be made. In this passage the contrast is yet more precise, for the fool is thought of as the dull, which is the proper meaning of &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-24.htm">Proverbs 17:24</a>. There is more hope for the fool than for him, although he may be no fool in himself, who overthrows himself by his words. "The &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (Sir. 9:18) has, in the existing case, already overleaped the thought; the &#1499;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500; has it still before him, and comes at length, perhaps with his slow conception, to it" (Hitzig); for the ass, according to the fable, comes at last farther than the greyhound. Hence, in words as well as in acts, the proverb holds good, "Eile mit Weile" [ equals  festina lente]. Every word, as well as act, can only be matured by being thought out, and thought over. From this proverb, which finds its practical application to the affairs of a house, and particularly also to the relation to domestics, the group returns to the subject of instruction, which is its ground-tone. </body></html>
