He is a fool who tells every thing he knows, and can keep no counsel. 12. One who loves flatterers, and hearkens to slanderers, causes his servants to become liars and false accusers. 13. Some are poor, others have a great deal of deceitful riches. They meet in the business of this world; the Lord gives to both the comforts of this life. To some of both sorts he gives his grace. 14. The rich will look to themselves, but the poor and needy the prince must defend and plead for. 15. Parents must consider the benefit of due correction, and the mischief of undue indulgence. 16. Let not the righteous have their faith and hope shocked by the increase of sin and sinners, but let them wait with patience. 17. Children must not be suffered to go without rebuke when they do amiss. 18. How bare does a place look without Bibles and ministers! and what an easy prey is it to the enemy of souls! That gospel is an open vision, which holds forth Christ, which humbles the sinner and exalts the Saviour, which promotes holiness in the life and conversation: and these are precious truths to keep the soul alive, and prevent it from perishing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Better, The poor and the oppressor.

Or "the usurer" (q); who by usury, by fraud and deception, is possessed of the mammon of unrighteousness, and is become rich; he and the poor man meet together; and so the sense is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-2.htm">Proverbs 22:2</a>; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-2.htm">Proverbs 22:2</a>; <p>the Lord lighteneth both their eyes; with the light of natural life, and with the light of natural reason, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>; and so is the same as being "the Maker of them all", in the above place; or he bestows his providential favours on both; causes his sun to shine upon the rich and poor, the wicked and the righteous, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>. Or it may be understood of the light of grace; for though, for the most part, God chooses and calls the poor of the world, and lightens their eyes with the light of his grace, when not many wise and noble are called and enlightened; yet this is not restrained wholly to men of one and the same condition of life; yea, God sometimes calls and enlightens publicans, tax gatherers, and extortioners, as Matthew and Zacchaeus. <p>(q)  "vir usurarum", Mercerus; "foenerator", Piscator, Tigurine version; "usurarius", Munster. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">deceitful man</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">oppressor.</span> The rendering <span class="ital">usurer</span>, A.V. marg., which follows the LXX. <span class="greekheb">δανειστής</span>, and Vulg. <span class="ital">creditor</span>, restricts the reference to one form of oppression.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">lighteneth both their eyes</span>] i.e. with the light of life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-3.htm" title="Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;">Psalm 13:3</a> [Hebrews 4].

"The man of oppressions" (<span class="accented">tekakim</span>) is the usurer, from whom the poor suffer most wrong and cruelty. The needy man and the rich lender are thrown together in social life. St. Jerome calls them <span class="accented">pauper et creditor</span>.

Here is comfort for the poor, that he has a tender Father who watches over him; here is a warning for the rich, that he will have to give an account of his stewardship. The former proverb spoke only generally of God being the Maker of both (comp. Psalm 13:8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>7 The righteous knoweth the cause of the poor,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the godless understandeth no knowledge.<p>The righteous knoweth and recogniseth the righteous claims of people of low estate, i.e., what is due to them as men, and in particular cases; but the godless has no knowledge from which such recognition may go forth (cf. as to the expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-25.htm">Proverbs 19:25</a>). The proverb begins like <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, which commends the just man's compassion to his cattle; this commends his sympathy with those who are often treated as cattle, and worse even than cattle.
