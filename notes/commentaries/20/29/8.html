The word of God warns all to flee from the wrath to come, to the hope set before us in Jesus Christ. 2. The people have cause to rejoice or mourn, as their rulers are righteous or wicked. 3. Divine wisdom best keeps us from ruinous lusts. 4. The Lord Jesus is the King who will minister true judgment to the people. 5. Flatterers put men off their guard, which betrays them into foolish conduct. 6. Transgressions always end in vexations. Righteous men walk at liberty, and walk in safety. 7. This verse is applicable to compassion for the distress of the poor, and the unfeeling disregard shown by the wicked. 8. The scornful mock at things sacred and serious. Men who promote religion, which is true wisdom, turn away the wrath of God. 9. If a wise man dispute with a conceited wrangler, he will be treated with anger or ridicule; and no good is done. 10. Christ told his disciples that they should be hated of all men. The just, whom the blood-thirsty hate, gladly do any thing for their salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Scornful men - The men who head political or religious revolutions, who inflame (literally as in the margin) the minds of the people against the powers that be. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Such as despise dominion, speak evil of dignities; proud and haughty men, that speak Loftily, and with a contempt of their superiors; or who make a mock at religion, and scoff at all that is good and serious; these bring the inhabitants of a city into a snare, to rebel against their governors, and so into mischief and ruin: or, they "burn a city", as the Septuagint and Syriac versions (o); they inflame it, or blow it up into a flame; raise a combustion in it, and fill it with strifes and contentions; and bring down the wrath of God upon it, like fire: or, they "blow upon a city" (p); raise storms and tempests in it; turn all things upside down, and throw it into the utmost confusion, or blow it up; <p>but wise men turn away wrath; the wrath of men, by their wise counsels and advice, and appease tumults and seditions, and restore things to a quiet and settled state; or the wrath of God, by interposing with their prayers between him and a sinful people, as Moses did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-23.htm">Psalm 106:23</a>. <p>(o) "Inflammant urbem", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator.

These are the persons who raise rebellion in a country and excite opposition to constituted authority. The rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;</span>, "bring into a snare," as in the Authorized Version, is supported by some of the Jewish versions and  commentaries; but the more correct rendering is "blow into a blaze, inflame," as the Revised Version (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-20.htm">Ezekiel 22:20, 21</a>). These scorners excite the populace to acts of fury, when all respect for piety and virtue is lost; they fan the passions of the fickle people, and lead them to civil discord and dangerous excesses (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-10.htm">Proverbs 22:10</a>). Septuagint, "Lawless men burn up a city." <span class="cmt_word">But wise men turn away wrath;</span> by their prudent counsels allay the angry passions roused by those evil men (see Ver. 11 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1, 18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The general ethical proverb is here followed by one that is political:<p>2 When the righteous increase, the people rejoice;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And when a godless man ruleth, the people mourn.<p>Regarding '&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1510;&#1491;&#1468; (Aquila rightly, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;), vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-28.htm">Proverbs 28:28</a>. If the righteous form the majority, or are in such numbers that they are the party that give the tone, that form the predominant power among the people (Fleischer, cum incrementa capiunt justi), then the condition of the people is a happy one, and their voice joyful (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-10.htm">Proverbs 11:10</a>); if, on the contrary, a godless man or (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>) godless men rule, the people are made to sigh (&#1497;&#1488;&#1504;&#1495; &#1506;&#1501;, with the Gaja, according to rule). "There is reason," as Hitzig remarks, "why &#1506;&#1501; should be placed first with, and then without, the article." In the first case it denotes the people as those among whom there is such an increase of the righteous; in the second case, the article is wanting, because it is not generally used in poetry; and, besides, its absence makes the second line consist of nine syllables, like the first. </body></html>
