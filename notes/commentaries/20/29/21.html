Here is an unprofitable, slothful, wicked servant; one that serves not from conscience, or love, but from fear. 20. When a man is self-conceited, rash, and given to wrangling, there is more hope of the ignorant and profligate. 21. Good usage to a servant does not mean indulgence, which would ruin even a child. The body is a servant to the soul; those that humour it, and are over-tender of it, will find it forget its place. 22. An angry, passionate disposition makes men provoking to one another, and provoking to God. 23. Only those who humble themselves shall be exalted and established. 24. The receiver is as bad as the thief. 25. Many are ashamed to own Christ now; and he will not own them in the day of judgment.

In a very tender and affluent way uses him with great familiarity; makes him sit at table, with him, feeds him with dainties, and clothes him in the most handsome manner, as if he was one of his own children: <p>shall have him become his son at the length: he will expect to be used as a son; he will not care to do any servile work, or anything, especially that is hard and laborious; he will be for supplanting the son and heir, and think to inherit all himself; or, however, become proud, haughty, and saucy. Jarchi interprets this of the evil imagination, or the corruption of nature, which is in a man from a child; which, if cherished and not subdued, wilt in the issue rule over a man: and some apply it to the body; which, if delicately pampered, and not kept under, will be master of the soul, instead of servant to it, and its members be instruments of unrighteousness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. his <span class="ital">son</span>] The meaning of the word which occurs only here is doubtful (see R.V. marg.), but this is the most probable rendering of it. The Vulg., as referred to in R.V. marg., has <span class="ital">sentiet eum contumacem</span>, shall have him become refractory. The LXX. give the proverb differently: “He that lives delicately from his youth shall be a servant, and shall be grieved with himself (<span class="greekheb">ὀδυνηθήσεται ἐφ</span>ʼ <span class="greekheb">ἑαυτῷ</span>) at the last.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child.</span> The verb <span class="accented">panak</span>, which is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, is rightly here translated as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui delicate nutrit</span>. It refers to the spoiling a person by over-refinement, luxury, and pampering - a treatment peculiarly unsuitable in the case of a bond servant, and one which makes such forgetful of his dependent position. Septuagint, "He that liveth wantonly (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fb7;</span>) from childhood shall be a servant."

The word rendered "son" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">manon</span>) is of doubtful meaning, and has been variously understood or misunderstood by interpreters. Septuagint, "And in the end shall have pain (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) over himself;" Symmachus, "shall have murmuring (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Postea sentiet eum contumacem</span>. Ewald translates "ungrateful;" Delitzsch, "place of increase," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a household of pampered scapegraces; but one does not see how the disaster can be called a place or a house. It seems safest in this uncertainty to adopt  the Jewish interpretation of "progeny:" "he will be as a son." The pampered servant will end by claiming the privileges of a son, and perhaps ousting the legitimate children from their inheritance (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a>; and the case of Ziba and Mephibosheth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>). "Fodder, a stick, and burdens are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work for a servant. If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest; but if thou let him go idle, he will seek liberty" (Ecclus. 33:24, etc.). Spiritual writers have applied this proverb to the pampering of the flesh, which ought to be under the control of its master, the spirit, but which, if gratified and unrestrained, gets the upper hand, and, like a spoiled servant, dictates to its lord. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A proverb with &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-15.htm">Proverbs 29:15</a>, is placed next to one with &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1508;&#1496;, but it begins a group of proverbs regarding discipline in the house and among the people:<p>15 The rod and reproof give wisdom;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But an undisciplined son is a shame to his mother.<p>With &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1496; [a rod], which <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-15.htm">Proverbs 22:15</a> also commends as salutary, &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1495;&#1514; refers to discipline by means of words, which must accompany bodily discipline, and without them is also necessary; the construction of the first line follows in number and gender the scheme <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-9.htm">Proverbs 27:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-7.htm">Zechariah 7:7</a>; Ewald, 339c. In the second line the mother is named, whose tender love often degenerates into a fond indulgence; such a darling, such a mother's son, becomes a disgrace to his mother. Our "ausgelassen," by which Hitzig translates &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, is used of joyfulness unbridled and without self-restraint, and is in the passage before us too feeble a word; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; is used of animals pasturing at liberty, wandering in freedom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>); &#1504;&#1506;&#1512; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; is accordingly a child who is kept in by no restraint and no punishment, one left to himself, and thus undisciplined (Luther, Gesenius, Fleischer, and others). </body></html>
