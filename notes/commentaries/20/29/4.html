The word of God warns all to flee from the wrath to come, to the hope set before us in Jesus Christ. 2. The people have cause to rejoice or mourn, as their rulers are righteous or wicked. 3. Divine wisdom best keeps us from ruinous lusts. 4. The Lord Jesus is the King who will minister true judgment to the people. 5. Flatterers put men off their guard, which betrays them into foolish conduct. 6. Transgressions always end in vexations. Righteous men walk at liberty, and walk in safety. 7. This verse is applicable to compassion for the distress of the poor, and the unfeeling disregard shown by the wicked. 8. The scornful mock at things sacred and serious. Men who promote religion, which is true wisdom, turn away the wrath of God. 9. If a wise man dispute with a conceited wrangler, he will be treated with anger or ridicule; and no good is done. 10. Christ told his disciples that they should be hated of all men. The just, whom the blood-thirsty hate, gladly do any thing for their salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Spendeth ... - The laws of parallelism would lead us to expect "troubleth his father," but that is passed over as a thing about which the profligate would not care, and he is reminded of what comes home to him, that he is on the road to ruin.<p>The king - The ruler, as the supreme fountain of all justice, and as the ideal judge, is contrasted with the taker of bribers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. by judgment&#8212;that is, righteous decisions, opposed to those procured by gifts (compare Pr 28:21), by which good government is perverted.<p>land&#8212;for nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By judgment; </span> by the free and impartial exercise of justice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He that receiveth gifts, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">a man</span> (for he would not vouchsafe to call him a king, as being unworthy of that name and office) <span class="ital">of oblations or gifts</span>, i.e. whose delight and common practice it is to take bribes, and sell justice. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The king by judgment establisheth the land,.... By executing, judgment and justice among his subjects, he establishes the laws of the land, and the government of it; he secures its peace and prosperity, and preserves his people in the possession at their properties and privileges; and makes them rich and powerful, and the state stable and flourishing, so that it continues firm to posterity; such a king was Solomon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a>; <p>but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it; that, is, a king that does so; Gersom observes that he is not called a king, because such a man is not worthy of the name, who takes gifts and is bribed by them to pervert judgment and justice; whereby the laws of the nation are violated, and the persons and properties of his subjects become the prey of wicked men; and so the state is subverted and falls to ruin: it is in the original text, "a man of oblations" (k); the word is generally used of the sacred oblations or offerings under the law; hence some understand it of a sacrilegious prince who of his own arbitrary power converts sacred things to civil uses. The Targum, Septuagint, Syriac and Arabic versions render it, a wicked and ungodly man; and the Vulgate Latin version, a covetous man; as such a prince must be in whatsoever light he is seen, whether as a perverter of justice through bribes, or as a sacrilegious man; though it may be rendered, "a man of exactions" (l), for it is used of the oblation of a prince which he receives from his people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-9.htm">Ezekiel 45:9</a>; as Aben Ezra observes; and so it may be interpreted of a king that lays heavy taxes upon his people, and thereby brings them to distress and poverty, and the state to ruin. <p>(k)  "vir oblationam", Montanus, Baynus, Grotius, Gejerus, Schultens.

In the security of the throne the land and people participate. <span class="cmt_word">He that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.</span> The expression, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">ish terumoth</span>), "man of offerings," "man of gifts," is ambiguous: it may mean "the taker of bribes," the unrighteous ruler who sells justice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>), or it may signify "the imposer of taxes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-13.htm">Ezekiel 45:13</a>, etc.) or forced benevolences. Aquila and Theodotion have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "man of heave offerings," and Wordsworth regards him as a man who claims and receives gifts, as if he were a deity on earth. Whichever sense we give to the phrase, the contrast lies between the inflexibly upright ruler and the iniquitous or extortionate prince. The Septuagint gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a transgressor;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">vir avarus</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The following proverb assumes the &#1489;&#1496;&#1495; of the foregoing:<p>(Note: We take the opportunity of remarking that the tendency to form together certain proverbs after one catchword is found also in German books of proverbs; vid., Paul, Ueber die urspr. Anord. von Friedanks Bescheidenheit (1870), p. 12.)<p>26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he that walketh in wisdom shall escape.<p>From the promise in the second line, Hitzig concludes that a courageous heart is meant, but when by itself &#1500;&#1489; never bears this meaning. He who trusteth in his own heart is not merely one who is guided solely "by his own inconsiderate, defiant impulse to act" (Zckler). The proverb is directed against a false subjectivity. The heart is that fabricator of thoughts, of which, as of man by nature, nothing good can be said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>. But wisdom is a gift from above, and consists in the knowledge of that which is objectively true, that which is normatively godlike. &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; is he who so walks that he has in wisdom a secure authority, and has not then for the first time, when he requires to walk, need to consider, to reckon, to experiment. Thus walking in the way of wisdom, he escapes dangers to which one is exposed who walks in foolish confidence in his own heart and its changeful feelings, thoughts, imaginations, delusions. One who thoughtlessly boasts, who vainly dreams of victory before the time, is such a person; but confidence in one's own heart takes also a hundred other forms. Essentially similar to this proverb are the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-22.htm">Jeremiah 9:22</a>., for the wisdom meant in 26b is there defined at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a>. </body></html>
