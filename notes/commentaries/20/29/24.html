Here is an unprofitable, slothful, wicked servant; one that serves not from conscience, or love, but from fear. 20. When a man is self-conceited, rash, and given to wrangling, there is more hope of the ignorant and profligate. 21. Good usage to a servant does not mean indulgence, which would ruin even a child. The body is a servant to the soul; those that humour it, and are over-tender of it, will find it forget its place. 22. An angry, passionate disposition makes men provoking to one another, and provoking to God. 23. Only those who humble themselves shall be exalted and established. 24.

That robs and steals, and raises away another man's property; which to do is sinful and contrary to the law of God, and punishable by it; and so it is to join with him in the theft, or to devise, or consent unto it; or to receive the stolen goods, or to hide and conceal them; or to hide the thief, or the theft, and not declare them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a>. Such an one <p>hateth his own soul; that is, he is not careful of it, he is not concerned for its welfare as he should be; for otherwise no man, properly speaking, hates his own flesh or body, and much less his soul; but he is negligent of the good of it, and, for the sake of the mammon of unrighteousness, runs the risk of the ruin of it; by which he shows that he loves the world more than his own soul; when the profit of the whole world is nothing to the soul of man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-36.htm">Proverbs 8:36</a>; <p>he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not; or "does not declare it" (b); he heareth the cursing of those that have lost their goods, and yet he does not declare where they are, and who is the author of the theft, though he knows; or, being suspected of being concerned in it, or, at least, of knowing who did it, be is had before a civil magistrate, and an oath is given him, which he takes, and yet he conceals the matter: which is an aggravation of his sin, and brings ruin to his soul. So the Targum, <p>"an oath is determined (or brought to him) and he confesseth not.'' <p>Some understand this of a distinct evil, of hearing cursing and swearing, and taking the name of God in vain, and blasphemy against him; yet, through fear of incurring the displeasure of men, and being reckoned a busy body, or through indifference and want of zeal for the glory of God, do not discover it, or inform of it, to a proper person, for the punishment of such; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>; and render the words (c), as "he that is partner with a thief hateth his own soul; so he that heareth cursing, and betrayeth it not." <p>(b)  "et non indicat", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Mercerus, Cocceius, Schultens, Michaelis.

This is explained by what follows: <span class="cmt_word">He heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not</span>; better, <span class="accented">he heareth the adjuration</span>, <span class="accented">and telleth not</span>. This refers to the course of proceeding defined by <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, and intimated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-2.htm">Judges 17:2</a>. When a theft was committed, the person wronged or the judge pronounced an imprecation on the thief and on any one who was privy to the crime, and refrained from giving information; a witness who saw and knew of it, and was silent under this formal adjuration, has to bear his iniquity; he is not only an accomplice of a criminal, he is also a perjurer; one sin leads to another. Some commentators explain the first hemistich as referring only to the crime of receiving or using stolen goods, by which a man commits a crime and exposes himself to punishment; but it is best taken, as above, in connection with the second clause, and as elucidated thereby. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>18 Without a revelation a people becomes ungovernable;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he that keepeth the law, happy is he.<p>Regarding the importance of this proverb for estimating the relation of the Chokma to prophecy, vid., vol. i. p. 41. &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; is, according to the sense, equivalent to &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, the prophetic revelation in itself, and as the contents of that which is proclaimed. Without spiritual preaching, proceeding from spiritual experience, a people is unrestrained (&#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, vid., regarding the punctuation at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-25.htm">Proverbs 28:25</a>, and regarding the fundamental meaning, at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-25.htm">Proverbs 1:25</a>); it becomes &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, disorderly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-25.htm">Exodus 32:25</a>; wild und wst, as Luther translates. But in the second line, according to the unity of the antithesis, the words are spoken of the people, not of individuals. It is therefore not to be explained, with Hitzig: but whoever, in such a time, nevertheless holds to the law, it is well with him! Without doubt this proverb was coined at a time when the preaching of the prophets was in vogue; and therefore this, "but whoever, notwithstanding," is untenable; such a thought at that time could not at all arise; and besides this, &#1514;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; is in the Book of Proverbs a moveable conception, which is covered at least by the law in contradistinction to prophecy. To&#770;ra denotes divine teaching, the word of God; whether that of the Sinaitic or that of the prophetic law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a>, cf. e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>). While, on the one hand, a people is in a dissolute condition when the voice of the preacher, speaking from divine revelation, and enlightening their actions and sufferings by God's word, is silent amongst them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-9.htm">Psalm 74:9</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-12.htm">Amos 8:12</a>); on the other hand, that same people are to be praised as happy when they show due reverence and fidelity to the word of God, both as written and as preached. That the word of God is preached among a people belongs to their condition of life; and they are only truly happy when they earnestly and willingly subordinate themselves to the word of God which they possess and have the opportunity of hearing. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (defective for &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;) is the older, and here the poetic kindred form to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>. </body></html>
