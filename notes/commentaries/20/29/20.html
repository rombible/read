Here is an unprofitable, slothful, wicked servant; one that serves not from conscience, or love, but from fear. 20. When a man is self-conceited, rash, and given to wrangling, there is more hope of the ignorant and profligate. 21. Good usage to a servant does not mean indulgence, which would ruin even a child. The body is a servant to the soul; those that humour it, and are over-tender of it, will find it forget its place. 22. An angry, passionate disposition makes men provoking to one another, and provoking to God. 23. Only those who humble themselves shall be exalted and established. 24. The receiver is as bad as the thief. 25. Many are ashamed to own Christ now; and he will not own them in the day of judgment.

"Every one that speaks," says St. Gregory, "while he waits for his hearer's sentence upon his words, is as it were subjected to the judgment of him by whom he is heard. Accordingly, he that fears to be condemned in respect of his words ought first to put to the test that which he delivers - that there may be a kind of impartial and sober umpire sitting between the hear and tongue, weighing with exactness whether the heart presents right words, which the tongue taking up with advantage may bring forward for the heater's judgment" ('Moral.,' 8:5, Oxford transl.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>14 A king who judgeth the poor with truth,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His throne shall stand for ever.<p>&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1514;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-5.htm">Isaiah 16:5</a> (synon. &#1489;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, &#1489;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1489;&#1502;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1512;), is equivalent to fidelity to duty, or a complete, full accomplishment of his duty as a ruler with reference to the dispensing of justice; in other words: after the norm of actual fact, and of the law, and of his duty proceeding from both together. &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; has in Codd., e.g., Jaman., and in the Venetian 1517, 21, rightly Rebia.
