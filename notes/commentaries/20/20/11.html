A good man is not liable to uneasiness in contriving what he shall do, or in reflecting on what he has done, as those who walk in deceit. And his family fare better for his sake. 8. If great men are good men, they may do much good, and prevent very much evil. 9. Some can say, Through grace, we are cleaner than we have been; but it was the work of the Holy Spirit. 10. See the various deceits men use, of which the love of money is the root. The Lord will not bless what is thus gotten. 11. Parents should observe their children, that they may manage them accordingly. 12. All our powers and faculties are from God, and are to be employed for him. 13. Those that indulge themselves, may expect to want necessaries, which should have been gotten by honest labour. 14. Men use arts to get a good bargain, and to buy cheap; whereas a man ought to be ashamed of a fraud and a lie. 15. He that prefers true knowledge to riches, follows the ways of religion and happiness. If we really believed this truth, the word of God would be valued as it deserves, and the world would lose its tempting influence. 16. Those ruin themselves who entangle themselves in rash suretiship. Also those who are in league with abandoned women. Place no confidence in either. 17. Wealth gotten by fraud may be sweet, for the carnal mind takes pleasure in the success of wicked devices; but it will be bitter in the reflection. 18. Especially we need advice in spiritual warfare. The word and Spirit of God are the best counsellors in every point. 19. Those dearly buy their own praise, who put confidence in a man because he speaks fairly. 20. An undutiful child will become very miserable. Never let him expect any peace or comfort. 21. An estate suddenly raised, is often as suddenly ruined. 22. Wait on the Lord, attend his pleasure, and he will protect thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The graces or the faults of children are not trifles.

The sense is, The future disposition and conversation of a man may very probably be conjectured from his childish manners. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Even a child is known by his doings,.... As well as a man; "ye shall know them by their fruits", <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16</a>; professors and profane. So a child soon discovers its genius by its actions; it soon shows its inclination and disposition; and some shrewd guesses may be made how it will turn out, a wise man or a fool, a virtuous or a vicious man; though this does not always hold good, yet something may be observed, which may be a direction to parents in the education of their children, and placing them out to what is proper and suitable for them. Some observe, that the word has a quite contrary meaning, that "a child carries himself a stranger by his doings" (e); so that he is not known by them: he so conceals and disguises himself, he acts so fraudulently and deceitfully, and plays the hypocrite, and puts the cheat on men, that they cannot tell what he is, nor what he will be; and if children can thus dissemble, as not to be known by their actions, then much more grown persons; <p>whether his work be pure, and whether it be right; not what his present work is, or actions are, but what his later life and conversation will be; which in some measure may be judged of, though not with certainty and exactness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>; especially when he acts a covert and deceitful part. <p>(e) "ignotus erit", i.e. "non facile cognoscitur", Vatablus; so R.

(For "even" (<span class="accented">gam</span>), see on Proverbs 17:26.) A child is open, simple, and straightforward in his actions; he has not the reserves and concealments which men practise, so you see by his conduct what his real character and disposition are. Ewald takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> in the sense of "play," "games;" but it seems never to have this meaning, and there is no need to change the usual signification. The habits of a life are learned in early age. The boy is father of the man. Delitzsch quotes the German proverbs, "What means to become a hook bends itself early," and "What means to become a thorn sharpens itself early;" and the Aramaean, "That which will become a gourd shows itself in the bud:" <span class="cmt_word">Whether his work be pure</span> ("clean," as ver. 9 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and whether it be right.</span> His conduct will show thus much, end will help one to prognosticate the future. Septuagint (according to the Vatican), "In his pursuits (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) a young man will be fettered in company with a holy man, and his way will be straight," which seems to mean that a good man will restrain the reckless doings of a giddy youth, and will lead him into better courses. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>5 The purpose in the heart of a man is deep water;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But a man of understanding draweth it out.<p>"Still waters are deep." Like such deep waters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-4.htm">Proverbs 18:4</a>) is that which a man hath secretly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a>) planned in his heart. He keeps it secret, conceals it carefully, craftily misleads those who seek to draw it out; but the man of &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, i.e., one who possesses the right criteria for distinguishing between good and bad, true and false, and at the same time has the capacity to look through men and things, draws out (the Venet. well, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;) the secret &#1506;&#1510;&#1492;, for he penetrates to the bottom of the deep water. Such an one does not deceive himself with men, he knows how to estimate their conduct according to its last underlying motive and aim; and if the purpose is one that is pernicious to him, he meets it in the process of realization. What is here said is applicable not only to the subtle statesman and the general, but also the pragmatical historian and the expositor, as, e.g., of a poem such as the book of Job, the idea of which lies like a pearl at the bottom of deep water. </body></html>
