A good man is not liable to uneasiness in contriving what he shall do, or in reflecting on what he has done, as those who walk in deceit. And his family fare better for his sake. 8. If great men are good men, they may do much good, and prevent very much evil. 9. Some can say, Through grace, we are cleaner than we have been; but it was the work of the Holy Spirit. 10. See the various deceits men use, of which the love of money is the root. The Lord will not bless what is thus gotten. 11. Parents should observe their children, that they may manage them accordingly. 12. All our powers and faculties are from God, and are to be employed for him. 13. Those that indulge themselves, may expect to want necessaries, which should have been gotten by honest labour. 14. Men use arts to get a good bargain, and to buy cheap; whereas a man ought to be ashamed of a fraud and a lie. 15. He that prefers true knowledge to riches, follows the ways of religion and happiness. If we really believed this truth, the word of God would be valued as it deserves, and the world would lose its tempting influence. 16. Those ruin themselves who entangle themselves in rash suretiship. Also those who are in league with abandoned women. Place no confidence in either. 17. Wealth gotten by fraud may be sweet, for the carnal mind takes pleasure in the success of wicked devices; but it will be bitter in the reflection. 18. Especially we need advice in spiritual warfare. The word and Spirit of God are the best counsellors in every point. 19. Those dearly buy their own praise, who put confidence in a man because he speaks fairly. 20. An undutiful child will become very miserable. Never let him expect any peace or comfort. 21. An estate suddenly raised, is often as suddenly ruined. 22. Wait on the Lord, attend his pleasure, and he will protect thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a> : Here perhaps, as a companion to <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-9.htm">Proverbs 20:9</a>, with a wider application to all judging one man by rules which we do not apply to ourselves or to another. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

The Septuagint makes this plain by rendering, "A weight great and small, and measures double" (see on Proverbs 11:1 and Proverbs 16:11; and comp. ver. 23). The ephah was a dry measure, being one-tenth of the homer, and occupying the same position in solids as the bath did in liquids. It equalled about three pecks of our measure. <span class="cmt_word">Both of them are alike abomination to the Lord</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-13.htm">Deuteronomy 25:13</a>, etc.); Septuagint, "Are impure before the Lord, even both of them, and he who doeth them." Pseudo-Bernard ('De Pass. Dom.,' 17.), applying the passage mystically, teaches that a man may be said to keep a double measure, who, being conscious of his own evil character, endeavours to appear righteous to others; who, as he puts it, "Suo judicio terrae proximus est, et aliis cupit elevatus videri." Others, connecting this verse in thought with the preceding, see in it a warning against judging a neighbour by a standard which we do not apply to ourselves. The Septuagint Version arranges the matter from ver. 10 onwards differently from the Hebrew, omitting vers. 14-19, and placing vers. 10-13 after ver. 22. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>4 At the beginning of the harvest the sluggard plougheth not;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And so when he cometh to the reaping-time there is nothing.<p>Many translators (Symmachus, Jerome, Luther) and interpreters (e.g., Rashi, Zckler) explain: propter frigus; but &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; is, according to its verbal import, not a synon. of &#1511;&#1512; and &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, but means gathering  equals  the time of gathering (synon. &#1488;&#1505;&#1497;&#1507;), from &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, carpere,<p>(Note: Vid., Fleischer in Levy's Chald. Wrterbuch, i.426.)<p>as harvest, the time of the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, the plucking off of the fruit; but the harvest is the beginning of the old Eastern agricultural year, for in Palestine and Syria the time of ploughing and sowing with the harvest or early rains (&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1507;  equals  &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-24.htm">Nehemiah 7:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-18.htm">Ezra 2:18</a>) followed the fruit harvest from October to December. The &#1502;&#1503; is thus not that of cause but of time. Thus rendered, it may mean the beginning of an event and onwards (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-25.htm">1 Samuel 30:25</a>), as well as its termination and onwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-17.htm">Leviticus 27:17</a>): here of the harvest and its ingathering and onwards. In 4b, the Cheth&#305;&#770;b and Ker&#305;&#770; vary as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17</a>. The fut. &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; would denote what stands before the sluggard; the perf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;&#1493; places him in the midst of this, and besides has this in its favour, that, interpreted as perf. hypotheticum, it makes the absence of an object to &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; more tenable. The Cheth&#305;&#770;b, &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;, is not to be read after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a> : he will beg in harvest - in vain (Jerome, Luther), to which Hitzig well remarks: Why in vain? Amid the joy of harvest people dispense most liberally; and the right time for begging comes later. Hitzig conjecturally arrives at the translation:<p>"A pannier the sluggard provideth not;<p>Seeketh to borrow in harvest, and nothing cometh of it."<p>But leaving out of view the "pannier," the meaning "to obtain something as a loan," which &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; from the connection may bear, is here altogether imaginary. Let one imagine to himself an indolent owner of land, who does not trouble himself about the filling and sowing of his fields at the right time and with diligence, but leaves this to his people, who do only as much as is commanded them: such an one asks, when now the harvest-time has come, about the ingathering; but he receives the answer, that the land has lain unploughed, because he had not commanded it to be ploughed. When he asks, there is nothing, he asks in vain (&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-6.htm">Proverbs 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a>). Meri rightly explains &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1507; by &#1502;&#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; &#1494;&#1502;&#1503; &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, and 4b by: "so then, when he asks at harvest time, he will find nothing;" on the other hand, the lxx and Aram. think on &#1495;&#1512;&#1507;, carpere conviciis, as also in Codd. here and there is found the meaningless &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1507;. </body></html>
