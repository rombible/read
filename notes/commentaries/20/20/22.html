We must not say, no, not in our hearts, I will return evil for evil; but must wait on the Lord, to whom it belongs to execute vengeance, and to deliver his people from all their enemies. We must refer ourselves to him, and leave it to him to plead our cause, or reckon with those that do us wrong, in such a way and manner as he shall think fit, and in his own due time.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:7. A good man is not liable to uneasiness in contriving what he shall do, or in reflecting on what he has done, as those who walk in deceit. And his family fare better for his sake. 8. If great men are good men, they may do much good, and prevent very much evil. 9. Some can say, Through grace, we are cleaner than we have been; but it was the work of the Holy Spirit. 10. See the various deceits men use, of which the love of money is the root. The Lord will not bless what is thus gotten. 11. Parents should observe their children, that they may manage them accordingly. 12. All our powers and faculties are from God, and are to be employed for him. 13. Those that indulge themselves, may expect to want necessaries, which should have been gotten by honest labour. 14. Men use arts to get a good bargain, and to buy cheap; whereas a man ought to be ashamed of a fraud and a lie. 15. He that prefers true knowledge to riches, follows the ways of religion and happiness. If we really believed this truth, the word of God would be valued as it deserves, and the world would lose its tempting influence. 16. Those ruin themselves who entangle themselves in rash suretiship. Also those who are in league with abandoned women. Place no confidence in either. 17. Wealth gotten by fraud may be sweet, for the carnal mind takes pleasure in the success of wicked devices; but it will be bitter in the reflection. 18. Especially we need advice in spiritual warfare. The word and Spirit of God are the best counsellors in every point. 19. Those dearly buy their own praise, who put confidence in a man because he speaks fairly. 20. An undutiful child will become very miserable. Never let him expect any peace or comfort. 21. An estate suddenly raised, is often as suddenly ruined. 22. Wait on the Lord, attend his pleasure, and he will protect thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God's awarding to everyone according to his works, is the true check to the spirit of vindictiveness (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).

The <span class="accented">jus talonis</span> is the natural feeling of man, to do to others as they have done unto you, to requite evil with evil. But the moralist teaches a better lesson, urging men not to study revenge, and approaching nearer to Christ's injunction, which gives the law of charity, "Whatsoever <span class="accented">ye would</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) that men should do to you, do ye even so to them" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>). The Christian rule is expounded fully by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-14.htm">Romans 12:14, 17</a>, etc). It was not unknown to the Jews; for we read in Tobit 4:15, "Do that to no man which thou hatest;" and Hillel enjoins, "Do not thou that to thy neighbour which thou hatest when it is done to thee." Even the heathens had excogitated this great principle. There is a saying of Aristotle, preserved by Diogenes Laertius, "Act towards your friends as you would wish them to act towards you." The Chinese have a proverb, "Water does not remain on the mountain, or vengeance in a great mind." <span class="cmt_word">Wait on the Lord, and he shall save thee.</span> The pious writer urges the injured person to commit his cause to the Lord, not in the hope of seeing vengeance taken on his enemy, but in the certainty that God will help him to bear the wrong and deliver him in his own good time and way. The Christian takes St. Peter's view, "Who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-13.htm">1 Peter 3:13</a>), knowing that "all things work together for good to them that love God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; comp. Ecclus. 2:2, 6). Septuagint, "Say not, I will avenge myself on my enemy, but wait on the Lord, that (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) he may help thee." The last clause may be grammatically rendered thus, but it is more in accordance with the spirit st' the proverb, as Delitzsch observes, to regard it as a promise.

To this imperative &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; is parallel: take him as a pledge (Theodotion, Jerome, the Venet. and Luther); it is not a substantive: his pledge (Targ.), which would require the word &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493; (&#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1493;); nor is it to be read with the Syr. &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, one pledges him; but it is imperative, not however of the Piel, which would be &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, and would mean "destroy him;" but, as Aben Ezra rightly, the imperative of Kal of &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;, to take as a pledge, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>, for &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; without any example indeed except &#1495;&#1504;&#1504;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-14.htm">Psalm 9:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-16.htm">Psalm 80:16</a>. The first line is clear: take his garment, for he has become good for another (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>), who has left him in the lurch, so that he must now become wise by experience. The second line also is intelligible if we read, according to the Cheth&#305;&#770;b, &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (Jerome, the Venet.), not &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501;, as Schultens incorrectly points it, and if we interpret this plur. like &#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/21-7.htm">Genesis 21:7</a>, with Hitzig following Luther, as plur. of the category: take him as a pledge, hold fast by his person, so as not to suffer injury from strange people for whom he has become surety. But the Ker&#305;&#770; requires &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (according to which Theodotion and the Syr., and, more distinctly still than these, the Targ. translates), and thus, indeed, it stands written, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-13.htm">Proverbs 27:13</a>, without the Ker&#305;&#770;, thus Bathra 173b reads and writes also here. Either &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is a strange woman, a prostitute, a maitresse for whom the unwise has made himself surety, or it is neut. for aliena res (lxx <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-13.htm">Proverbs 27:13</a>, &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;), a matter not properly belonging to this unwise person. We regard &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in this passage as original. &#1489;&#1506;&#1491; coincides with <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-26.htm">Proverbs 6:26</a> : it does not mean &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;, but &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;; "for strange people" is here equivalent to for the sake of, on account of strange people" is here equivalent to for the sake of, on account of strange people (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, as the Venet. translates it). </body></html>
