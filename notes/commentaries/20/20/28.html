The evasions men often use with their own consciences show how false and deceitful man is. 26. Justice should crush the wicked, and separate them from the virtuous. 27. The rational soul and conscience are as a lamp within us, which should be used in examining our dispositions and motives with the revealed will of God. 28.

A still higher truth is proclaimed in the Prologue of John's Gospel.

Which are two good qualifications in a prince; not ruling his subjects with rigour and cruelty, but with tenderness and clemency; easing them as much as he can of burdens and pressures; showing compassion to the distressed, and pardoning delinquents when the case will admit of it; as also being faithful to his word, promises, and engagements; inviolably adhering to the laws and constitution of the nation, and steady in his administrations of justice; these preserve him in the affections of his people, and make him safe and secure on his throne; and because of these the Lord preserves him from his enemies. It maybe rendered, "grace and truth" (l); and applied to Christ, who is full of both, and which are said to preserve him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a>; <p>and his throne is upholden by mercy; this explains what is meant by the preservation of him, and what is the security of his throne and kingdom, which is clemency and goodness to his subjects. <p>(l)  "gratis et veritas", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mercy and truth preserve the king.</span> (For "mercy and truth," see note on Proverbs 3:3.) The love and faithfulness which the king displays in dealing with his subjects elicits the like virtues in them, and these are the safeguard of his throne. <span class="cmt_word">His throne is upholden by mercy;</span> or, <span class="accented">love.</span> So the king is well called the father of his people, and in modern times the epithet "gracious" is applied to the sovereign as being the fountain of mercy and condescension. Sallust, 'Jugurtha,' 10, "Non exercitus neque thesauri praesidia regni sunt, verum amici, quos neque armis cogere neque auro parare queas; officio et fide pariuntur." Septuagint,  "Mercy (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) and truth are a guard to a king, and will surround his throne with righteousness." "The subject's love," says our English maxim, "is the king's lifeguard." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>22 Say not: I will avenge the evil;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope in Jahve, so will He help thee.<p>Men ought always to act toward their neighbours according to the law of love, and not according to the jus talionis, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-29.htm">Proverbs 24:29</a>; they ought not only, by requiting good with evil (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-13.htm">Proverbs 16:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7-5.htm">Psalm 7:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-12.htm">Psalm 35:12</a>), not to transgress this law of requital, but they ought to surpass it, by also recompensing not evil with evil (vid., regarding &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;, and synon. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-13.htm">Proverbs 17:13</a>); and that is what the proverb means, for 22b supposes injustice suffered, which might stir up a spirit of revenge. It does not, however, say that men ought to commit the taking of vengeance to God; but, in the sense of <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17-19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-9.htm">1 Peter 3:9</a>, that, renouncing all dependence on self, they ought to commit their deliverance out of the distress into which they have fallen, and their vindication, into the hands of God; for the promise is not that He will avenge them, but that He will help them. The jussive &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; (write &#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, according to Metheg-setzung, 42, with Gaja as &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1492;, with the &#1506; to secure distinct utterance to the final guttural) states as a consequence, like, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10</a>, what will then happen (Jerome, Luther, Hitzig) if one lets God rule (Gesen. 128, 2c); equally possible, syntactically, is the rendering: that He may help thee (lxx, Ewald); but, regarded as a promise, the words are more in accordance with the spirit of the proverb, and they round it off more expressively. </body></html>
