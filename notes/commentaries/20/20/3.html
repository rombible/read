How different is this from the modern cede, which makes a man's honour consist in his readiness to avenge fancied injury at the risk of his own or his neighbour's life! Septuagint, "It is a glory to a man to hold himself aloof from revilings." <span class="cmt_word">Every fool will be meddling</span> (see on Proverbs 17:14; 18:1). Delitzsch, "Whoever is a fool showeth his teeth," finds pleasure in strife.

The part., which has the force of an attributive clause, is continued in the finite: qui matrem fugat; this is the rule of the Heb. style, which is not filome'tochos, Gesen. 134, Anm. 2. Regarding &#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>; regarding the placing together of &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1492;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-5.htm">Proverbs 13:5</a>, where for &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, to make shame, to be scandalous, the word &#1492;&#1489;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, which is radically different, meaning to bring into bad odour, is used. The putting to shame is in &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; ni si  (kindred with Arab. ba&#770;th) thought of as disturbatio (cf. &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;) (cf. at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-11.htm">Psalm 6:11</a>), in &#1495;&#1508;&#1512; (khfr) as opertio (cf. Cicero's Cluent. 20: infamia et dedecore opertus), not, as I formerly thought, with Frst, as reddening, blushing (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>). Putting to shame would in this connection be too weak a meaning for &#1502;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;. The paedagogic stamp which <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a> impresses on this fourth principal part is made yet further distinct in the verse that now follows. </body></html>
