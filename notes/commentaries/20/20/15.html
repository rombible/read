A good man is not liable to uneasiness in contriving what he shall do, or in reflecting on what he has done, as those who walk in deceit. And his family fare better for his sake. 8. If great men are good men, they may do much good, and prevent very much evil. 9. Some can say, Through grace, we are cleaner than we have been; but it was the work of the Holy Spirit. 10. See the various deceits men use, of which the love of money is the root. The Lord will not bless what is thus gotten. 11. Parents should observe their children, that they may manage them accordingly. 12. All our powers and faculties are from God, and are to be employed for him. 13. Those that indulge themselves, may expect to want necessaries, which should have been gotten by honest labour. 14. Men use arts to get a good bargain, and to buy cheap; whereas a man ought to be ashamed of a fraud and a lie. 15. He that prefers true knowledge to riches, follows the ways of religion and happiness. If we really believed this truth, the word of God would be valued as it deserves, and the world would lose its tempting influence. 16. Those ruin themselves who entangle themselves in rash suretiship. Also those who are in league with abandoned women. Place no confidence in either. 17. Wealth gotten by fraud may be sweet, for the carnal mind takes pleasure in the success of wicked devices; but it will be bitter in the reflection. 18. Especially we need advice in spiritual warfare. The word and Spirit of God are the best counsellors in every point. 19. Those dearly buy their own praise, who put confidence in a man because he speaks fairly. 20. An undutiful child will become very miserable. Never let him expect any peace or comfort. 21. An estate suddenly raised, is often as suddenly ruined. 22. Wait on the Lord, attend his pleasure, and he will protect thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A precious jewel - literally, "A vessel of preciousness," i. e., most precious of all are "the lips of knowledge." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

There is gold which is precious, and there is abundance of pearls which are still more valuable. But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel, and worth more than all. We had the expression, "lips of knowledge," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-7.htm">Proverbs 14:7</a>; it means lips that utter wisdom. <span class="accented">Keli</span>, often translated "jewel" in the Authorized Version, also boars the meaning of "vessel," "utensil." So here the Vulgate, <span class="accented">vas pretiosum</span>; and the wise man's lips are called a vessel because they contain and distribute the wisdom that is within. (On the excellence and value of wisdom, see ch. Proverbs 3:14, etc; Proverbs 8:11, etc.) Connecting this with the preceding verse, we are led to the thought of buying, and the Lord's parable of the merchant seeking goodly pearls, and bartering all his wealth to gain possession of a worthy jewel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-45.htm">Matthew 13:45</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>9 Who can say I have made my heart clean,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pure from my sins?<p>It is the same thought that Solomon expresses in his prayer at the consecration of the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-46.htm">1 Kings 8:46</a> : there is no man who sinneth not. To cleanse his heart (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-13.htm">Psalm 73:13</a>), is equivalent to to empty it, by self-examination and earnest effort after holiness, of all impure motives and inclinations; vid., regarding &#1494;&#1499;&#1492;, to be piercing, shining brightly, cloudlessly pure, Fleischer in Levy's Chald. Wrterbuch, i. 424. The consequence of &#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is, becoming pure; and the consequence of &#1494;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;, i.e., of the purifying of the heart, the being pure from sinful conduct: I have become pure from my sins, i.e., from such as I might fall into by not resisting temptations; the suffix is not understood as actual, but as potential, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-24.htm">Psalm 18:24</a>. No one can boast of this, for man's knowledge of himself and of his sins remains always limited (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-13.htm">Psalm 19:13</a>); and sin is so deeply rooted in his nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm">Job 14:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14-16</a>), that the remains of a sinful tendency always still conceal themselves in the folds of his heart, sinful thoughts still cross his soul, sinful inclinations still sometimes by their natural force overcome the moral resistance that opposes them, and stains of all kinds still defile even his best actions. </body></html>
