A bargain made by fraud will prove a losing bargain in the end. 24. How can we form plans, and conduct business, independently of the Lord? 25. The evasions men often use with their own consciences show how false and deceitful man is. 26. Justice should crush the wicked, and separate them from the virtuous. 27. The rational soul and conscience are as a lamp within us, which should be used in examining our dispositions and motives with the revealed will of God. 28. Mercy and truth are the glories of God's throne. 29. Both young and old have their advantages; and let neither despise or envy the other.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God's awarding to everyone according to his works, is the true check to the spirit of vindictiveness (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).

Possession (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-17.htm">Proverbs 4:17</a>) or enjoyment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17</a>) obtained by deceit is thus called, as &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-3.htm">Proverbs 23:3</a>, denotes bread; but for him who has a relish for it, it is connected with deceit. Such bread of lies is sweet to a man, because it has come to him without effort, but in the end not only will he have nothing to eat, but his tongue, teeth, and mouth will be injured by small stones; i.e., in the end he will have nothing, and there will remain to him only evil (Fleischer). Or: it changes itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-14.htm">Job 20:14</a>) at last into gravel, of which his mouth is filled full, as we might say, "it lies at last in his stomach like lead." &#1495;&#1510;&#1509; is the Arab. h&#803;at&#803;ny, gravel (Hitzig, grien  equals  gries, coarse sand, grit), R. &#1495;&#1509;, scindere. Similarly in Arab. h&#803;ajar, a stone, is used as the image of disappointed expectations, e.g., the adulterer finds a stone, i.e., experiences disappointment. </body></html>
