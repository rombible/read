A good man is not liable to uneasiness in contriving what he shall do, or in reflecting on what he has done, as those who walk in deceit. And his family fare better for his sake. 8. If great men are good men, they may do much good, and prevent very much evil. 9. Some can say, Through grace, we are cleaner than we have been; but it was the work of the Holy Spirit. 10. See the various deceits men use, of which the love of money is the root. The Lord will not bless what is thus gotten. 11. Parents should observe their children, that they may manage them accordingly. 12. All our powers and faculties are from God, and are to be employed for him. 13. Those that indulge themselves, may expect to want necessaries, which should have been gotten by honest labour. 14. Men use arts to get a good bargain, and to buy cheap; whereas a man ought to be ashamed of a fraud and a lie. 15. He that prefers true knowledge to riches, follows the ways of religion and happiness. If we really believed this truth, the word of God would be valued as it deserves, and the world would lose its tempting influence. 16. Those ruin themselves who entangle themselves in rash suretiship. Also those who are in league with abandoned women. Place no confidence in either. 17. Wealth gotten by fraud may be sweet, for the carnal mind takes pleasure in the success of wicked devices; but it will be bitter in the reflection. 18. Especially we need advice in spiritual warfare. The word and Spirit of God are the best counsellors in every point. 19. Those dearly buy their own praise, who put confidence in a man because he speaks fairly. 20. An undutiful child will become very miserable. Never let him expect any peace or comfort. 21. An estate suddenly raised, is often as suddenly ruined. 22. Wait on the Lord, attend his pleasure, and he will protect thee.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A connecting link between <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4</a>.

There is a trace of this in the version here of the LXX., <span class="greekheb">αἱ δὲ κόραι τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτοῦ ὄψονται σκότος</span>.

The legal penalty may be seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>); but this was probably seldom or never carried into execution (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-10.htm">Mark 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His lamp shall be put out in obscure</span> (<span class="accented">the blackest</span>) <span class="cmt_word">darkness</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-9.htm">Proverbs 13:9</a>). The expression is peculiar; it is literally, according to the Khetib, <span class="accented">In the apple of the eye of darkness</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-9.htm">Proverbs 7:9</a>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the very centre of darkness; he will find himself surrounded on all sides by midnight darkness, without escape, with no hope of Divine protection. "Lamp" is a metaphor applied to the bodily and the spiritual life, to happiness and prosperity, to a man's fame and reputation, to a man's posterity; and all these senses may be involved in the denunciation of the disobedient and stubborn child. He shall suffer in body and soul, in character, in fortune, in his children. His fate is the exact counterpart of the blessing promised in the Law. Septuagint, "The lamp of him that revileth father and mother shall be extinguished, and the pupils of his eyes shall behold darkness." Talmud, "Whosoever abandons his parents means his body to become the prey of scorpions." Cato, 'Dist.,' 3:23 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Dilige non aegra caros pietate parentes;<br />Nec matrem offendas, dum vis bonus esse parenti."</span> One of the evil generations denounced by Agur (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-11.htm">Proverbs 30:11</a>) is that which curseth parents. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The following group has its natural limit at the new point of departure at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a>, and is internally connected in a diversity of ways.<p>14 "Bad, bad!" saith the buyer;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And going his way, he boasteth then.<p>Luther otherwise:<p>"Bad, bad!" saith one if he hath it;<p>But when it is gone, then he boasteth of it.<p>This rendering has many supporters. Geier cites the words of the Latin poet:<p>"Omne bonum praesens minus est, sperata videntur Magna."<p>Schultens quotes the proverbs &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769; and Praesentia laudato, for with Luther he refers &#1493;&#1488;&#1494;&#1500; &#1500;&#1493; to the present possession (&#1488;&#1494;&#1500;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7</a>  equals  (Arab.) za&#770;l, to cease, to be lost), and translates: at dilapsum sibi, tum demum pro splendido celebrat. But by this the Hithpa. does not receive its full meaning; and to extract from &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; the idea to which &#1493;&#1488;&#1494;&#1500; &#1500;&#1493; refers, if not unnecessary, is certainly worthless. Hakkoneh may also certainly mean the possessor, but the possessor by acquisition (lxx and the Venet. &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;); for the most part it signifies the possessor by purchase, the buyer (Jerome, emptor), as correlate of &#1502;&#1499;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>. It is customary for the buyer to undervalue that which he seeks to purchase, so as to obtain it as cheaply as possible; afterwards he boasts that he has bought that which is good, and yet so cheap. That is an every-day experience; but the proverb indirectly warns against conventional lying, and shows that one should not be startled and deceived thereby. The subject to &#1493;&#1488;&#1494;&#1500; &#1500;&#1493; is thus the buyer; &#1488;&#1494;&#1500; with &#1500;&#1493; denotes, more definitely even than &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; &#1500;&#1493;, going from thence, s'en aller. Syntactically, the punctuation &#1493;&#1488;&#1494;&#1500; &#1500;&#1493; [and he takes himself off] (perf. hypoth., Ewald, 357a) would have been near (Jerome: et cum recesserit); but yet it is not necessary, with Hitzig, thus to correct it. The poet means to say: making himself off, he then boasts. We cannot in German place the "alsdann" [then] as the &#1488;&#1494; here, and as also, e.g., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-12.htm">1 Samuel 20:12</a>; but Theodotion, in good Greek: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. We may write &#1493;&#1488;&#1494;&#1500; &#1500;&#1493; with Mercha on the antepenult, on which the accent is thrown back, cf. &#1495;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, but not &#1500;&#1468;&#1493;; for the rule for Dagesh does not here, with the retrogression of the tone, come into application, as, e.g., in &#1488;&#1493;&#1499;&#1500; &#1500;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-10.htm">Psalm 41:10</a>. Singularly the Syr. and Targ. do not read &#1512;&#1506; &#1512;&#1506;, but &#1512;&#1506; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;, and couple <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-15.htm">Proverbs 20:15</a> with 14. In the lxx, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-14.htm">Proverbs 20:14-19</a> are wanting. </body></html>
