Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy the humble are, we see that with the lowly is wisdom. 3. An honest man's principles are fixed, therefore his way is plain. 4. Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death. 5,6. The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment. 7. When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish. 8. The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangerous situations, and the ungodly go in their stead. 9. Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections against the truths of God's word. 10,11. Nations prosper when wicked men are cast down. 12. A man of understanding does not judge of others by their success. 13. A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it. 14. We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others. 15. The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies. 16. A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth. 17. A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself. 18. He that makes it his business to do good, shall have a reward, as sure to him as eternal truth can make it. 19. True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction. 20. Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness. 21. Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners. 22. Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments. 23. The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves. 24. A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing. 25. Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren. 26. We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage. 27. Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The day of wrath - Words true in their highest sense of the great "diesirae" of the future, but spoken in the first instance (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15-18</a>) of any "day of the Lord," any time of judgment, when men or nations receive the chastisement of their sins.

Expatriation is the worst of all evils with which the prophets threatened individuals and the people, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-17.htm">Amos 7:17</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-17.htm">Isaiah 22:17</a>.; and the history of Israel in their exile, which was a punishment of their national apostasy, confirms this proverb and explains its form; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-21.htm">Proverbs 2:21</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-29.htm">Psalm 37:29</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1500; is, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-13.htm">Proverbs 9:13</a>, the emphatic No of the more elevated style; &#1504;&#1502;&#1493;&#1496;, the opposite of &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-3.htm">Proverbs 12:3</a>; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503; signifies to dwell, both inchoative: to come to dwell, and consecutive: to continue to dwell (e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, of God who inhabiteth eternity). In general, the proverb means that the righteous fearlessly maintains the position he takes; while, on the contrary, all they who have no hold on God lose also their outward position. But often enough this saying is fulfilled in this, that they, in order that they may escape disgrace, became wanderers and fugitives, and are compelled to conceal themselves among strangers. </body></html>
