Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy the humble are, we see that with the lowly is wisdom. 3. An honest man's principles are fixed, therefore his way is plain. 4. Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death. 5,6. The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment. 7. When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish. 8. The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangerous situations, and the ungodly go in their stead. 9. Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections against the truths of God's word. 10,11. Nations prosper when wicked men are cast down. 12. A man of understanding does not judge of others by their success. 13. A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it. 14. We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others. 15. The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies. 16. A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth. 17. A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself. 18. He that makes it his business to do good, shall have a reward, as sure to him as eternal truth can make it. 19. True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction. 20. Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness. 21. Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners. 22. Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments. 23. The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves. 24. A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing. 25. Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren. 26. We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage. 27. Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Withholdeth more than is meet - i. e., Is sparing and niggardly where he ought to give.

That scattereth "his own", as the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions add: that disperses his money here and there, among many poor objects, plentifully and liberally; and his substance is so far from being lessened by such a conduct, that, by the blessing of God, it is increased more and more; or "become richer", as the Vulgate Latin; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-9.htm">Psalm 112:9</a>. So he that disperses and dispenses the word of God, and spreads the truths of the Gospel, and freely and fully preaches them, increases himself in spiritual knowledge and understanding; <p>and there is that withholdeth more than is meet; or, "right" or "just" (a), by the, laws of God and men; from himself, from his family, from his friends and relations, and from the poor of the church and of the world; and from the cause and interest of Christ, and what is necessary to support that, according to his ability; <p>but it tendeth to poverty, or "want" (b): such a man is often brought to beggary; there is a moth and rottenness sent into his substance, which secretly consume it: so he that withholds any truth or doctrine, that keeps back anything that may be profitable to the saints; this tends to the impoverishing: of his soul, and the souls of them that attend on his ministry. <p>(a) "plus aequo", Vatablus, Mercerus, Gejerus; "plus quam aequum est", Cocceius; "prae quam rectum est, seu plus aequo", Michaelis.

In regard to both, benevolence brings its reward, and hatred its punishment.<p>The godless acquires deceptive gain;<p>But he that soweth righteousness, a true reward.<p>Jerome makes 18b an independent clause, for he translates it as if the word were written &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;; the Syr. and Targ. also, as if &#1488;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1512;&#1493; (his fidelity is his reward). But according to the text as it stands, &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; extends its regimen to both parts of the verse; to make is here equivalent to, to work out, to acquire, &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-1.htm">Genesis 31:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a>, etc. The labour of the godless has selfishness as its motive, and what he acquires by his labour is therefore "delusive gain," - it is no blessing, it profits him not (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2</a>), and it brings him no advantage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-16.htm">Proverbs 10:16</a>). He, on the contrary, acquires truth, i.e., a truly profitable and enduring reward, who sows right-doing, or better: good-doing, by which we also, as the biblical moral in &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, think principally of well-doing, unselfish activity and self-sacrificing love. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a> speaks of sowing which has only &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; as the norm; and how &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492; is understood is seen from the parallel use of &#1495;&#1505;&#1491; [piety]. The "true reward" is just the harvest by which the sowing of the good seed of noble benevolent actions is rewarded. </body></html>
