(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-18.htm" title="The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.">Proverbs 21:18</a>.) Or, it may mean that the righteous “is taken away from the evil to come “by death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-1.htm" title="The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.">Isaiah 57:1</a>), the wicked lives on to suffer in his place.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1 However men may make light of giving short weight or measure, and however common such crimes may be, they are an abomination to the Lord. 2. Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy the humble are, we see that with the lowly is wisdom. 3. An honest man's principles are fixed, therefore his way is plain. 4. Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death. 5,6. The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment. 7. When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish. 8. The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangerous situations, and the ungodly go in their stead. 9. Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections against the truths of God's word. 10,11. Nations prosper when wicked men are cast down. 12. A man of understanding does not judge of others by their success. 13. A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it. 14. We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others. 15. The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies. 16. A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth. 17. A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself. 18. He that makes it his business to do good, shall have a reward, as sure to him as eternal truth can make it. 19. True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction. 20. Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness. 21. Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners. 22. Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments. 23. The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves. 24. A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing. 25. Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren. 26. We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage. 27. Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Significant words, as showing the belief that when the righteous died, his "expectation" (i. e., his hope for the future) did not perish.

The evil from which the righteous is saved fails upon the wicked. As Abraham says to Dives in the parable, "He is comforted, but thou art tormented" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-25.htm">Luke 16:25</a>). Of this substitution many instances occur in Scripture. Thus Haman was hanged on the gallows which he had erected for Mordecai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>); Daniel's accusers were cast into the den of lions from which he was saved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-4.htm">Isaiah 43:4</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Now follows the Solomonic "Pride goeth before a fall."<p>There cometh arrogance, so also cometh shame;<p>But with the humble is wisdom.<p>Interpreted according to the Hebr.: if the former has come, so immediately also comes the latter. The general truth as to the causal connection of the two is conceived of historically; the fact, confirmed by many events, is represented in the form of a single occurrence as a warning example; the preterites are like the Greek aoristi gnomici (vid., p. 32); and the perf., with the fut. consec. following, is the expression of the immediate and almost simultaneous consequence (vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a>): has haughtiness (&#1494;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; after the form &#1500;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, from &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;, to boil, to run over) appeared, then immediately also disgrace appeared, in which the arrogant behaviour is overwhelmed. The harmony of the sound of the Hebr. &#1494;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; and &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503; cannot be reproduced in German [nor in English]; Hitzig and Ewald try to do so, but such a quid pro quo as "Kommt Unglimpf kommt an ihn Schimpf" [there comes arrogance, there comes to him disgrace] is not a translation, but a distortion of the text. If, now, the antithesis says that with the humble is wisdom, wisdom is meant which avoids such disgrace as arrogance draws along with it; for the &#1510;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; thinks not more highly of himself than he ought to think (R. &#1510;&#1503;, subsidere, demitti, Deutsch. Morgenl. Zeitsch. xxv. 185). </body></html>
