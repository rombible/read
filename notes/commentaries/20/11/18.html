Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy the humble are, we see that with the lowly is wisdom. 3. An honest man's principles are fixed, therefore his way is plain. 4. Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death. 5,6. The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment. 7. When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish. 8. The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangerous situations, and the ungodly go in their stead. 9. Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections against the truths of God's word. 10,11. Nations prosper when wicked men are cast down. 12. A man of understanding does not judge of others by their success. 13. A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it. 14. We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others. 15. The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies. 16. A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth. 17. A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself. 18. He that makes it his business to do good, shall have a reward, as sure to him as eternal truth can make it. 19. True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction. 20. Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness. 21. Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners. 22. Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments. 23. The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves. 24. A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing. 25. Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren. 26. We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage. 27. Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Deceitful work - Work which deceives and disappoints the worker; in contrast with the "sure reward" of the second clause.<p>Omit "shall be" and render, "but he that soweth righteousness worketh a sure reward." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. a deceitful work&#8212;or, "wages," which fail to satisfy, or flee away (Pr 10:2; 23:5).<p>sure reward&#8212;or, "gain," as from trading (Ho 10:12; Ga 6:8, 9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A deceitful work; </span> a work which will deceive his expectation of that good for which he worketh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That soweth; </span> that worketh it with constancy, and diligence, and hope of recompence, as they do who sow in seed-time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Righteousness; </span> good works, acts of piety towards God, and charity to men. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The wicked worketh a deceitful work,.... Such a wicked man as before described; that neither enjoys the good things of life he has, nor suffers others to enjoy them; and all to accumulate riches, which are deceitful and perishing; and who abstains from meats, which God has created for use, under a pretence of religion, and so deceives his own soul; and indeed every sin which a wicked man commits is a deceitful work; it promises him that pleasure, or profit, or liberty, which it does not give him, and in the issue is the ruin of him; and so all false doctrines, propagated by deceitful workers, are deceitful works, by which they deceive the simple, and at last themselves; they "obtain a deceitful reward of their work", as Gussetius (w) renders it; <p>but to him that soweth righteousness; does acts of beneficence and liberality; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-9.htm">2 Corinthians 9:9</a>; and all other good works, or works of righteousness, <p>shall be a sure reward; according to what a man sows, and the manner in which he sows, so shall he reap, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>; or, "a reward of truth"; instead of being given up to believe a lie, he shall receive the love of the truth, and abide in it, which will bring him to eternal glory and happiness; he being chosen to it through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:10</a>; and, instead of a deceitful reward, shall have a true, real, solid, and substantial one. <p>(w) Ebr.

The Septuagint has, "unrighteous works," which seems a jejune rendering, and does not bring out the contrast of the <span class="cmt_word">sure reward</span> in the second member (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-2.htm">Proverbs 10:2, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To him that soweth righteousness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-8.htm">Galatians 6:8, 9</a>). To "sow righteousness" is to act righteously, to live in such a way that the result is holiness. The "reward," in a Jew's eyes, would be a long life in which to enjoy the fruits of his good conduct. We Christians have a better hope, which is, perhaps, adumbrated by this analogy: as the seed sown in the field does not produce its fruit till the time of harvest, so righteousness meets with its full recompense only in the great harvest at the end of all things. The Revised Version renders, <span class="accented">The wicked earnnth deceitful wages</span>: <span class="accented">but he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward.</span> This makes a good antithesis. The  Septuagint renders the last clause, "but the seed of the righteous is a true reward (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There now follow two proverbs which refer to the intercourse of private life.<p>He who mocketh his neighbour is devoid of understanding;<p>But the intelligent man remaineth silent.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a> is a proverb similarly beginning with &#1489;&#1468;&#1494; &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a> is another beginning with &#1489;&#1468;&#1494; &#1500;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;. From this one sees that &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1494; &#1500; (cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;&#1492; &#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>) does not mean a speaking contemptuously in one's presence; as also from <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-30.htm">Proverbs 6:30</a>, that contemptuous treatment, which expresses itself not in mockery but in insult, is thus named; so that we do not possess a German [nor an English] expression which completely covers it. Whoever in a derisive or insulting manner, whether it be publicly or privately, degrades his neighbour, is unwise (&#1495;&#1505;&#1512;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489; as pred., like <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32</a>); an intelligent man, on the contrary, keeps silent, keeps his judgment to himself, abstains from arrogant criticisms, for he knows that he is not infallible, that he is not acquainted with the heart, and he possesses too much self-knowledge to raise himself above his neighbour as a judge, and thinks that contemptuous rejection, unamiable, reckless condemnation, does no good, but on the contrary does evil on all sides. </body></html>
