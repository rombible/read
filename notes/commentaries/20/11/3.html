Considering how safe, and quiet, and easy the humble are, we see that with the lowly is wisdom. 3. An honest man's principles are fixed, therefore his way is plain. 4. Riches will stand men in no stead in the day of death. 5,6. The ways of wickedness are dangerous. And sin will be its own punishment. 7. When a godly man dies, all his fears vanish; but when a wicked man dies, his hopes vanish. 8. The righteous are often wonderfully kept from going into dangerous situations, and the ungodly go in their stead. 9. Hypocrites delude men into error and sin by artful objections against the truths of God's word. 10,11. Nations prosper when wicked men are cast down. 12. A man of understanding does not judge of others by their success. 13. A faithful man will not disclose what he is trusted with, unless the honour of God and the real good of society require it. 14. We shall often find it to our advantage to advise with others. 15. The welfare of our families, our own peace, and our ability to pay just debts, must not be brought into danger. But here especially let us consider the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ in becoming Surety even for enemies. 16. A pious and discreet woman will keep esteem and respect, as strong men keep possession of wealth. 17. A cruel, froward, ill-natured man, is vexatious to those that are, and should be to him as his own flesh, and punishes himself. 18. He that makes it his business to do good, shall have a reward, as sure to him as eternal truth can make it. 19. True holiness is true happiness. The more violent a man is in sinful pursuits, the more he hastens his own destruction. 20. Nothing is more hateful to God, than hypocrisy and double dealing, which are here signified. God delights in such as aim and act with uprightness. 21. Joining together in sin shall not protect the sinners. 22. Beauty is abused by those who have not discretion or modesty with it. This is true of all bodily endowments. 23. The wicked desire mischief to others, but it shall return upon themselves. 24. A man may grow poor by not paying just debts, not relieving the poor, not allowing needful expenses. Let men be ever so saving of what they have, if God appoints, it comes to nothing. 25. Both in temporal and spiritual things, God commonly deals with his people according to the measure by which they deal with their brethren. 26. We must not hoard up the gifts of God's bounty, merely for our own advantage. 27. Seeking mischief is here set against seeking good; for those that are not doing good are doing hurt, even to themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A rabbinic paraphrase of the second clause is: "Lowly souls become full of wisdom as the low place becomes full of water." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. guide&#8212;to lead, as a shepherd (Pr 6:7; Ps 78:52).<p>perverseness&#8212;ill-nature.<p>destroy&#8212;with violence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The integrity of the upright, </span> their sincere obedience to God’s laws, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">shall guide them; </span> shall keep them from crooked and dangerous courses, and lead them in a right and safe way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them; </span> those wicked devices by which they design and expect to secure themselves, shall be the instrument of their destruction. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The integrity of the upright shall guide them,.... The Spirit of God is the best guide of an upright man; he leads into all truth, and unto the land of uprightness, and continues to be a guide, even unto death; and it is right to walk after him, and not after the flesh: and besides him, the upright man has the word of God as a lamp to his feet, and a light to his paths, which he does well to take heed to; and next to that is the sincerity and uprightness of his heart, which will not suffer him, knowingly and willingly, to go aside into crooked paths, or to do amiss: integrity of heart and innocency of hand go together; such are the followers of the Lamb, as described, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-21.htm">Psalm 25:21</a>; <p>but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them; the perverse ways, words, and actions of such as transgress the law of God, deal treacherously with God and men, as the word (e) signifies, shall be their ruin: the perverse doctrines and worship of the man of sin, and his followers, shall bring destruction upon them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>. The word for "perverseness" is only used here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-4.htm">Proverbs 15:4</a>; and there plainly signifies the perverseness of the tongue or speech, and so may have respect to corrupt doctrine. <p>(e) "perfidosorum", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "perfidorum", Cocceius, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">perverseness</span>] Some would render <span class="ital">slipperiness</span>; as we say, “a slippery fellow.” The noun occurs here only and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-4.htm" title="A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.">Proverbs 15:4</a>, but the cognate verb is found several times in this Book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-6.htm" title="Righteousness keeps him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthrows the sinner.">Proverbs 13:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-3.htm" title="The foolishness of man perverts his way: and his heart frets against the LORD.">Proverbs 19:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-12.htm" title="The righteous man wisely considers the house of the wicked: but God overthrows the wicked for their wickedness.">Proverbs 21:12</a>).

'&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492; and '&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;, understood objectively, are the two O.T. names of true religion. It means, then, the way which the God of revelation directs men to walk in (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a>), the way of His precepts, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-27.htm">Psalm 119:27</a>, His way of salvation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-3.htm">Psalm 67:3</a> (4); in the N.T. &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a>.; cf. &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; simply, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>. This way of Jahve is a fortress, bulwark, defence for innocence, or more precisely, a disposition wholly, i.e., unreservedly and without concealment, directed toward God and that which is good. All the old interpreters, also Luther, but not the Graec. Venet., translate as if the expression were &#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;; but the punctuation has preferred the abstr. pro concreto, perhaps because the personal &#1514;&#1468;&#1501; nowhere else occurs with any such prefix; on the contrary, &#1514;&#1468;&#1501; is frequently connected with &#1489;, &#1499;, &#1500;. &#1500;&#1514;&#1501; &#1491;&#1512;&#1498;, integro viae (vitae), are by no means to be connected in one conception (Ziegler, Umbr., Elster), for then the poet ought to have written &#1502;&#1506;&#1494; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1500;&#1514;&#1501;&#1470;&#1491;&#1512;&#1498;. 29b cannot be interpreted as a thought by itself: and ruin (vid., regarding &#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, ruina, and subjectively consternatio, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-16.htm">Proverbs 10:16</a>) comes to those who do evil; but the thought, much more comprehensive, that religion, which is for the righteous a strong protection and safe retreat, will be an overthrow to those who delight only in wickedness (vid., on &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, p. 143), is confirmed by the similarly formed distich, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-15.htm">Proverbs 21:15</a>. Also almost all the Jewish interpreters, from Rashi to Malbim, find here expressed the operation of the divine revelation set over against the conduct of men - essentially the same as when the Tora or the Chokma present to men for their choice life and death; or the gospel of salvation, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>, is to one the savour of life unto life, to another the savour of death unto death. </body></html>
