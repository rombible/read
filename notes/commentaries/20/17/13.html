Those who set their hearts upon money, will do any thing for it. What influence should the gifts of God have on our hearts! 9. The way to preserve peace is to make the best of every thing; not to notice what has been said or done against ourselves. 10. A gentle reproof will enter, not only into the head, but into the heart of a wise man. 11. Satan, and the messengers of Satan, shall be let loose upon an evil man. 12. Let us watch over our own passions, and avoid the company of furious men. 13. To render evil for good is devilish. He that does so, brings a curse upon his family. 14. What danger there is in the beginning of strife! Resist its earliest display; and leave it off, if it were possible, before you begin. 15. It is an offence to God to acquit the guilty, or to condemn those who are not guilty. 16. Man's neglect of God's favour and his own interest is very absurd. 17. No change of outward circumstances should abate our affection for our friends or relatives. But no friend, except Christ, deserves unlimited confidence. In Him this text did receive, and still receives its most glorious fulfilment. 18. Let not any wrong their families. Yet Christ's becoming Surety for men, was a glorious display of Divine wisdom; for he was able to discharge the bond.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The large brown bear of Syria, in her rage at the loss of her whelps, was to the Israelites the strongest type of brute ferocity.

This might be illustrated by the judgments of God on the nation of the Jews, for their ingratitude to Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whoso rewardeth evil for</span> <span class="cmt_word">good.</span> This was David's complaint of the churlish Nabal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-21.htm">1 Samuel 25:21</a>). Ingratitude shall surely he punished. <span class="cmt_word">Evil shall not depart from his house</span>. Terribly has the ingratitude of the Jews been visited. They cried in their madness, "His blood be on us and on our children!" and their punishment is still going on. Injunctions on this subject are frequent in the New Testament (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-9.htm">1 Peter 3:9</a>). The Talmud says, "Do not throw a stone into the well whose waters you have drunk." The Greeks felt the sting of ingratitude.

Ernst Jungius in Oetinger: lingua dicax ac sermonem ultra quam decorum verbis extendere solita), rather imperative (Bertheau), better presumptuous (Hitzig) words, properly words of superfluity, i.e., of superabundant self-consciousness and high pretension (cf. the transitive bearing of the Arab. watr with &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, from &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;, Aryan upar, Job, p. 363).

It produces a disagreeable impression, when a man of vulgar mind and of rude conduct, instead of keeping himself in retirement, makes himself of importance, and weighty in a shameless, impudent manner (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/12-9.htm">Psalm 12:9</a>, where &#1494;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, vilitas, in a moral sense); but yet more repulsive is the contrast, when a man in whom one is justified in expecting nobility of mind, in accordance with his life-position and calling, degrades himself by uttering deceitful words. Regarding the &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, concluding a minori ad majus, we have already spoken at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>. R. Ismael, in Bereschith Rabba, at 44:8, reckons ten such conclusions a minori ad majus in the Scriptures, but there are just as many quanto magis. The right accentuation (e.g., in Cod. 1294) is here &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;, transformed from &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1497;&#1470;&#1500;&#1504;&#1491;&#1497;&#1489;, according to Accentuationssystem, xviii. 2.</body></html>
