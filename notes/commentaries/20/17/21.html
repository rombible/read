If we would keep a clear conscience and a quiet mind, we must shun all excitements to anger. And a man who affects a style of living above his means, goes the way to ruin. 20. There is nothing got by ill designs. And many have paid dear for an unbridled tongue. 21. This speaks very plainly what many wise and good men feel very strongly, how grievous it is to have a foolish, wicked child. 22. It is great mercy that God gives us leave to be cheerful, and cause to be cheerful, if by his grace he gives us hearts to be cheerful. 23. The wicked are ready to part with their money, though loved, that they may not suffer for their crimes. 24. The prudent man keeps the word of God continually in view. But the foolish man cannot fix his thoughts, nor pursue any purpose with steadiness. 25. Wicked children despise the authority of their father, and the tenderness of their mother. 26. It is very wrong to find fault for doing what is duty. 27,28. A man may show himself to be a wise man, by the good temper of his mind, and by the good government of his tongue. He is careful when he does speak, to speak to the purpose. God knows his heart, and the folly that is bound there; therefore he cannot be deceived in his judgment as men may be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He that exalteth his gate - i. e., Builds a stately house, indulges in arrogant ostentation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

As it proves in the issue; though it was joy to him when a man child was born, and took delight in him while in infancy and childhood, and promised himself much happiness in him when at years of discretion; but, instead of that, he departs from his education principles, despises all parental counsels and advice, and goes into all the extravagance of sin and folly; which is an heartbreaking to his godly and religious parents; for this is to be understood; not of an idiot, but of a wicked son, taking bad courses; <p>and the father of a fool hath no joy; in his son, but sorrow, and has scarce any joy or pleasure in anything else in all his enjoyments; the trouble he is filled with on his account embitters all he has, that he can take no satisfaction, or have any comfort of life; the concern for his son is uppermost in his thoughts, and hinders him from taking that pleasure which otherwise he might enjoy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">a fool … a fool</span>] The Heb. word so rendered is not the same in the two clauses of the verse. The first word in the first clause describes the fool as <span class="ital">dull</span> or <span class="ital">senseless</span>, or as some think <span class="ital">obstinate</span>. The second word points him out as <span class="ital">shameless</span>, like Nabal, whose name (the Heb. word here) was descriptive of his character (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-25.htm" title="Let not my lord, I pray you, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I your handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom you did send.">1 Samuel 25:25</a>). There is a third Heb. word, used more commonly than either of these in this Book, which regards a fool as one who is <span class="ital">perverse</span>, or as some render, <span class="ital">weak</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow</span> (comp. ver. 25). The words for "fool" in the two clauses are different. Here it is <span class="accented">kesil</span>, which implies bold, self-confident folly, the worst form of the vies; in the second hemistich it is <span class="accented">nabal</span>, which rather denotes dulness and stupidity, a want of mental power. A conceited, offensive fool causes infinite trouble to his father, both from his need of constant correction, and the watchfulness required to repair the consequences of his foolish actions. There is also the grief at seeing instruction and warning thrown away on a worthless object. Septuagint, "The heart of a fool is a pain to him who possesseth it." <span class="cmt_word">The father of a fool hath no joy.</span> The contrast in the case of a good son is seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-20.htm">Proverbs 15:20</a> and Proverbs 23:24. The LXX. adds a clause from <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>, with the view of improving the parallelism, "But a prudent son rejoiceth his mother." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>15 He that acquitteth the guilty and condemneth the righteous - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An abomination to Jahve are they both.<p>The proverb is against the partisan judge who is open to bribery, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-24.htm">Proverbs 24:24</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>, where, with reference to such, the announcement of punishment is emphatically made. &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; and &#1510;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511;, in a forensic sense, are equivalent to sons (reus) and insons. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; (cf. the Arab. jmy'na, altogether, but particularly the Pers. ham and the Turkish dkhy standing wholly thus in the numeral) is here, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-45.htm">Genesis 27:45</a>, equivalent to &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-12.htm">Jeremiah 46:12</a> (in its unions  equals  united). Whoever pronounces sentence of justification on the guilty, appears as if he must be judged more mildly than he who condemns the guiltless, but both the one and the other alike are an abhorrence to God. </body></html>
