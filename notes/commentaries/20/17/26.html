If we would keep a clear conscience and a quiet mind, we must shun all excitements to anger. And a man who affects a style of living above his means, goes the way to ruin. 20. There is nothing got by ill designs. And many have paid dear for an unbridled tongue. 21. This speaks very plainly what many wise and good men feel very strongly, how grievous it is to have a foolish, wicked child. 22. It is great mercy that God gives us leave to be cheerful, and cause to be cheerful, if by his grace he gives us hearts to be cheerful. 23. The wicked are ready to part with their money, though loved, that they may not suffer for their crimes. 24. The prudent man keeps the word of God continually in view. But the foolish man cannot fix his thoughts, nor pursue any purpose with steadiness. 25. Wicked children despise the authority of their father, and the tenderness of their mother. 26. It is very wrong to find fault for doing what is duty. 27,28. A man may show himself to be a wise man, by the good temper of his mind, and by the good government of his tongue. He is careful when he does speak, to speak to the purpose. God knows his heart, and the folly that is bound there; therefore he cannot be deceived in his judgment as men may be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nor to strike ... - Better, and to strike the noble (in character rather than in rank) is against right.

It is evil, and an abomination to the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a>. Evildoers indeed should be punished; but to punish the righteous also, as well as them, is far from being commendable; <p>nor to strike princes for equity: to strike princes, judges, civil magistrates, for doing the duty of their place and office, for doing that which is just and equitable among men, is very criminal, who ought to be encouraged and supported therein. Or it may be rendered, nor "that princes should strike for that which is right" (b) or cause men to be stricken, scourged, and whipped for doing well. The Targum is, <p>"nor to smite the righteous, who say right things;'' <p>and so the Syriac version renders it, "righteous ones"; and the word signifies ingenuous liberal persons, good men, such as princes are or ought to be; and who should neither be stricken in the due discharge of their office, nor strike others that do well. <p>(b)    "principes percuiere ob rectitudinem", Mercerus; "propter recta facta", Piscator, Gataker. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Also to punish the just <i>is</i> not good, <i>nor</i> to strike princes <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> for equity.</span><p>(n) For their well doing.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">Also</span>] beside other things that are “not good”; as “also” is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-2.htm" title="Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hastens with his feet sins.">Proverbs 19:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">punish</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">mulct</span>, or (as R.V. marg.) <span class="bld">fine</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">strike</span>] i.e. inflict the severer punishment of scourging. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/25-1.htm" title="If there be a controversy between men, and they come to judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked....">Deuteronomy 25:1-3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">princes</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">the noble</span>, R.V.

"Princes" are the noble in character rather than in position only.

Revised Version, <span class="accented">nor to smite the noble for their uprightness.</span> So virtually the Vulgate, Septuagint, and Syriac. Another rendering is, "to strike the noble is against right," which seems feeble and less suitable to the parallelism. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>20 He that is of a false heart findeth no good;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he that goeth astray with his tongue falleth into evil.<p>Regarding &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489;, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-20.htm">Proverbs 11:20</a>.
