A small quantity of bread; a broken piece of bread, as the word (w) signifies; which has been long broken off, and become "dry" (x); a dry crust of bread; old bread, as the Arabic version; an old, mouldy, dry piece of bread: and the word used has the signification of destruction in it: bread that has lost its taste and virtue; or, however, a mere piece of bread is meant, without anything to eat with it, as Gersom, butter, cheese, or flesh: this, with quietness and peace among those that partake of it, peace in the family, in a man's own mind, especially if he has the peace of God, which passeth all understanding; this is better <p>than a house full of sacrifices with strife; than a house ever so well furnished with good cheer, or a table ever so richly spread; or where there is plenty of slain beasts for food, or for sacrifice, which were usually the best, and part of which the people had to eat, and at which times feasts used to be made; but the meanest food, with tranquillity and contentment, is preferable to the richest entertainment where there is nothing but strife and contention among the guests; for, where that is, there is confusion and every evil work: peace and joy in the Holy Ghost are better than meats and drinks.

This rendering, however, may be arrived at in either of two ways, (1) We may suppose that the ordinance of feasting on part of a sacrifice <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-16.htm" title="But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:">Leviticus 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/19-6.htm" title="It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire....">Leviticus 19:6-8</a>) appealed so to the popular mind, that the restriction to “the place which the Lord their God should choose” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/12-4.htm" title="You shall not do so to the LORD your God....">Deuteronomy 12:4-14</a>) came to be neglected, and as is too commonly the case, with Christmas, for example, in our own day, the word which should have denoted a religious act before God, sank down to mean a mere worldly feast at home. (2) But it may be doubted whether the Heb. for <span class="ital">sacrifice</span> is not used here in the sense of animals <span class="ital">slain</span> or <span class="ital">killed</span> for eating, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-15.htm" title="Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatever your soul lusts after, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.">Deuteronomy 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-24.htm" title="And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hurried, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:">1 Samuel 28:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-21.htm" title="And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they did eat.

Thus Boaz bid Ruth "dip her morsel in the vinegar" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>); thus Jesus gave the sop to Judas when he had dipped it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26</a>). The Septuagint is pleonastic, "Better is a morsel with joy in peace." Aben Ezra connects this verse with the last two of ch. 16, confining the application to the patient man; but the sentence seems rather to be independent and general. <span class="cmt_word">Than an house full of sacrifices with strife.</span> Of the thank or peace offerings part only was burnt upon the altar, the rest was eaten by the offerer and his family; and as the victims were always the choicest animals, "a house full of sacrifices" would contain the materials for sumptuous feasting (see on Proverbs 7:4). The joyous family festival often degenerated into excess, which naturally led to quarrels and strife (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-5.htm">1 Samuel 1:5, 6, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13</a>, etc.). So the agapae of the early Church were desecrated by licence and selfishness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-20.htm">1 Corinthians 11:20</a>, etc.). Septuagint, "than a house full of many good things and unrighteous victims with contention." With this verse compare the Spanish proverb, "Mas vale un pedazo de pan con amor, que gallinas con dolor." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>28 A man of falsehood scattereth strife,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a backbiter separateth confidential friends.<p>Regarding &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; (&#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;) &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-12.htm">Proverbs 2:12</a>, and &#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>; the thought of 28b is found at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a>. &#1504;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503; (with &#1503; minusculum, which occurs thrice with the terminal Nun) is a Niphal formation from &#1512;&#1490;&#1503;, to murmur (cf. &#1504;&#1494;&#1497;&#1491;, from &#1494;&#1497;&#1491;), and denotes the whisperer, viz., the backbiter, &#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Sir. 5:14, &#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;, susurro; the Arab. nyrj is abbreviated from it, a verbal stem of &#1504;&#1512;&#1490; (cf.
