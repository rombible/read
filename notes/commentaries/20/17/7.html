A wicked man. Eloquence, or a sublime grand way of speaking, a copiousness and fluency of expression, become not such; because hereby he may be capable of doing more mischief; or such a style is unsuitable to the subject of his discourse, which is nothing but folly and wickedness. The Gospel is excellent speech, sound speech, that cannot be condemned; it treats of excellent things; concerning the person, office, and grace of Christ, and salvation by him; and very unfit is a wicked man to take it into his mouth, talk of it, and declare it; <p>much less do lying lips a prince; they rather become a fool, as excellent speech does a prince; who neither should speak lies himself, nor encourage, but abhor them in others. The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, render it, "a just man": but the word more property signifies a liberal man, as it is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-8.htm">Isaiah 32:8</a>; where it stands opposed to a churl or covetous man: and some Jewish (f) writers think by the "fool" is meant such an one to whom a "lip of abundance" (g), as it may be rendered, is very unsuitable; or to talk of his abundance, when he makes no good use of what he has for himself or others; and so, on the other hand, it is very disagreeable to the character of an ingenuous and liberal man to promise and not perform, and never intended it. It is true of such who are made a "willing" people in the day of Christ's power, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-3.htm">Psalm 110:3</a>; where the same word is used as here; of his volunteers; that to speak lies one to another very ill becomes them; or to receive, or to speak, or profess false doctrines; for no lie is of the truth. <p>(f) Kabvenaki in Mercer. in loc.

A <span class="accented">nabal</span>, a "vicious fool," ought not to flaunt his unwisdom and his iniquities before the eyes of men, but to keep them hidden as much as possible. As such presumptuous behaviour is incongruous in the case of a fool, much less do lying lips [become] a prince; a noble person, such a one as is called in Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-8.htm">Isaiah 32:8</a>) "liberal," where the same word, <span class="accented">nadib</span>, is used.

"My son," says the rabbi in the Talmud, "avoid lying first of all; for a lie will tarnish the brightness of thy honour." For "prince," the Septuagint has, "a just man," which makes the maxim a mere truism.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A comparative proverb with &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, pairing with <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a> :<p>Better a dry piece of bread, and quietness therewith,<p>Than a house full of slain beasts with unquietness.<p>Similar to this in form and contents are <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514; &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; is a piece of bread (&#1508;&#1514;, fem., as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-8.htm">Proverbs 23:8</a>) without savoury drink (Theodotion, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8; &#787; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, i.e., nothing with it), cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-10.htm">Leviticus 7:10</a>, a meat-offering without the pouring out of oil. &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; are not sacrificial gifts (Hitzig), but, as always, slain animals, i.e., either offerings or banquets of slain beasts; it is the old name of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14</a>), part of which only were offered on the altar, and part presented as a banquet; and &#1494;&#1489;&#1495; (in contradist. to &#1496;&#1489;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-2.htm">Leviticus 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/43-16.htm">Leviticus 43:16</a>) denotes generally any kind of consecrated festival in connection with the worship of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>.
