Observe, reader, this price, these abilities and opportunities to gain wisdom, are put into all our hands; we have rational souls, the means of grace, the aids of the Holy Spirit, liberty of access to God by prayer, time and opportunity, perhaps also we have good parents, relations, friends, ministers, books to assist us. A sufficient price, therefore, is put into our hands, wherewith to procure wisdom, a talent, or talents rather, of inestimable value; and surely we shall be inexcusable, and cannot escape condemnation and wrath, if we die without it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:8. Those who set their hearts upon money, will do any thing for it. What influence should the gifts of God have on our hearts! 9. The way to preserve peace is to make the best of every thing; not to notice what has been said or done against ourselves. 10. A gentle reproof will enter, not only into the head, but into the heart of a wise man. 11. Satan, and the messengers of Satan, shall be let loose upon an evil man. 12. Let us watch over our own passions, and avoid the company of furious men. 13. To render evil for good is devilish. He that does so, brings a curse upon his family. 14. What danger there is in the beginning of strife! Resist its earliest display; and leave it off, if it were possible, before you begin. 15. It is an offence to God to acquit the guilty, or to condemn those who are not guilty. 16. Man's neglect of God's favour and his own interest is very absurd. 17. No change of outward circumstances should abate our affection for our friends or relatives. But no friend, except Christ, deserves unlimited confidence. In Him this text did receive, and still receives its most glorious fulfilment. 18. Let not any wrong their families. Yet Christ's becoming Surety for men, was a glorious display of Divine wisdom; for he was able to discharge the bond.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>More literally: Why is there a price in the hand of a fool?

Natural wisdom and knowledge. By this "price" may be meant money, riches, worldly substance, of which a foolish man is possessed; by means of which he might purchase useful books for the improvement of his mind, and procure himself instructors that might be very useful to him; but instead of seeking after that which he most wants, and making use of his substance to furnish him with it, he spends it on his back and belly, in fine clothes and luxurious living; in rioting and drunkenness, in chambering and wantonness, at balls and plays, in taverns and brothel houses: or spiritual wisdom and knowledge; the means of which are reading the word, hearing the Gospel, frequent opportunities of attendance on a Gospel ministry, in season and out of season, and conversation with Gospel ministers and other Christians; but, instead of making use of these, he neglects, slights, and despises them. And it is asked, with some degree of indignation and admiration, why or to what purpose a fool is favoured with such means; <p>seeing he hath no heart to it? to wisdom; he does not desire it, nor to make use of the price or means, in order to obtain it; all is lost upon him; and it is hard to account for it why he should have this price, when he makes such an ill use of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Why <i>is there</i> a <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing <i>he hath</i> no heart <i>to it</i>?</span><p><span class="cverse3">{g}</span> What good does it do the wicked to be rich, seeing he does not set his mind to wisdom?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">heart</span>] i.e. <span class="bld">understanding</span>, R.V.; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-32.htm" title="He that refuses instruction despises his own soul: but he that hears reproof gets understanding.">Proverbs 15:32</a>, note. We might almost render, <span class="bld">capacity</span>. Wisdom cannot be bought for a price: it can only be assimilated by a wise, or wisdom-loving heart. Its words are <span class="greekheb">φωνᾶντα συνετοῖσι</span>; its teachers teach, <span class="greekheb">πνευματικοῖς πνευματικὰ συγκρίνοντες</span>, “interpreting spiritual things to spiritual men” (as some translate <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-13.htm" title="Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Ghost teaches; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.">1 Corinthians 2:13</a>).

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quid prodest stulto habere divitias, cum sapientiam emere non possit</span>? The rabbis in later time were  not allowed to take fees for teaching; but it was customary to make offerings to seers and wise men, when their services were engaged or their advice was asked (see the case of Saul and Samuel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7, 8</a>). The last clause gives the reason why it is useless for a fool to try to learn wisdom even at a large expenditure on teachers. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing he hath no heart to it;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no capability for receiving it; his mental digestion cannot assimilate it. The heart, as we have already noticed, is regarded as the seat of the understanding. Thus the LXX., "Why doth a fool have wealth? for a man without heart cannot acquire wisdom." In the Gospel Christ calls his disciples "fools and slow of heart to believe what the prophets had written, and himself opened their mind (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>), that they might understand the Scriptures" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25, 45</a>). The Septuagint and Vulgate here introduce a distich derived from portions of vers. 19, 20, "He who raises his house high seeketh destruction; and he who perversely declineth from learning (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) shall fall into evils." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>10 One reproof maketh more impression on a wise man<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than if one reckoned a hundred to the fool<p>One of the few proverbs which begin with a future, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-26.htm">Proverbs 12:26</a>. It expresses what influence there is in one reproof with a wise man (&#1502;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-9.htm">Proverbs 8:9</a>); &#1490;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492; is the reproof expressed by the post-bibl. &#1504;&#1494;&#1497;&#1508;&#1492; .lbib, as the lowest grade of disciplinary punishment, admonitio, connected with warning. The verbal form &#1514;&#1492;&#1514; is the reading of the lxx and Syr.

It is, however, first to be seen whether the traditional text stands in need of this correction. As fut. Niph. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, apart from the ult. accent. to be expected, gives no meaning. Also if one derives it from &#1495;&#1514;&#1492;, to snatch away, to take away, it gives no appropriate thought; besides, &#1495;&#1514;&#1492; is construed with the object. accus., and the fut. Apoc., in itself strange here, must be pointed either &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1514; or &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468; (after &#1497;&#1495;&#1491;&#1468;) (Bttcher, Lehrb. ii. p. 413). Thus &#1497;&#1495;&#1514;, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-13.htm">Job 21:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>, will be fut.

With this derivation, also, &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; is to be expected; the reference in the Handwrterbuch to Gesen. Lehrgebude, 51, 1, Anm. 1, where, in an extremely inadequate way, the retrogression of the tone (&#1504;&#1505;&#1493;&#1490; &#1488;&#1495;&#1493;&#1512;) is spoken of, is altogether inappropriate to this place; and Bttcher's explanation of the ult. tone from an intended expressiveness is ungrammatical; but why should not &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;, from &#1504;&#1495;&#1514;, with its first syllable originating from contraction, and thus having the tone be Milel as well as Milra, especially here, where it stands at the head of the sentence? With &#1489; connected with it, &#1504;&#1495;&#1514; means: to descend into anything, to penetrate; Hitzig appropriately compares altius in pectus descendit of Sallust, Jug. 11. Jerome rightly, according to the sense: plus proficit, and the Venet. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; (read &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;) &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;. In 10b &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a>) is to be supplied to &#1502;&#1488;&#1492;, not &#1508;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (an hundred times, which may be denoted correctly by &#1502;&#1488;&#1492; as well as &#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a>). With the wise (says a Talmudic proverb) a sign does as much as with the fool a stick does.
