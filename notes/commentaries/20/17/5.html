He that mocks the poor for his poverty, Upbraids him with his mean appearance, scoffs at the clothes he wears or food he eats, such an one reproaches his Creator; or, as the Targum, <p>"provokes his Creator to anger;'' <p>him who is his own Creator as well as the poor man's; him who made the poor man, both as a man and as a poor man; and who could have made him rich if he would, as well as the man that mocks at him; whose riches are not of himself, but of God; and who can take them away, and give them to the poor man if he pleases; and therefore rich men should be careful how they mock the poor; for, as Gersom observes, he that derides a work derides the workman; <p>and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished; or "at calamity" (c); at the calamity of another, as the Vulgate Latin; and so Gersom; for no man rejoices at his own calamity; at the calamity of the poor, as Aben Ezra; or of his neighbour or companion, as the Targum; or at the calamity of any of his fellow creatures, as the Edomites rejoiced at the calamity of the Jews, but were in their turn destroyed; and as the Jews rejoiced when the Christians were persecuted by Nero, and at length were destroyed themselves by the Romans; and as the Papists will rejoice when the witnesses are slain, and quickly after seven thousand men of name will be slain of them, and the rest frightened, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-10.htm">Revelation 11:10</a>. <p>(c) "ad calamitatem", Schultens; "ob calamitatem", Cocceius; "calamitate", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">his Maker</span>] Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-31.htm" title="He that oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker: but he that honors him has mercy on the poor.">Proverbs 14:31</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">glad at calamities</span>] “It belonged to the Greek mind in its fertility of combination, to express it (the temper here spoken of) by the single word <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχαιρεκακία</span> (Arist. <span class="ital">Eth.

The particular calamity primarily intended seems to be that which reduces a person to poverty. Delight in others' misfortunes, even those of enemies, is a most detestable form of selfishness and malice. Job, testifying to his own integrity, was thankful to think that he was free from this vice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-29.htm">Job 31:29</a>). The Greeks had a name for it, and called it <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, which is used by Aristotle ('Eth. Nic.,' 2:6. 18). The pious author looks for retributive punishment on such spitefulness. The LXX. tries to improve the contrast by resorting a gloss, "He who rejoices at one who perishes shall not go unpunished; but he who hath compassion shall obtain mercy," which is remarkably like Christ's sentence, "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>32 Better one slow to anger than a hero in war;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And whoever is master of his spirit, than he who taketh a city.<p>Regarding &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a>, where &#1511;&#1510;&#1512;&#1470;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; was the parallel of the contrast. The comparison is true as regards persons, with reference to the performances expressed, and (since warlike courage and moral self-control may be united in one person) they are properly those in which the &#1496;&#1493;&#1489; determines the moral estimate. In Pirke Aboth iv. 1, the question, "Who is the hero?" is answered by, "he who overcomes his desire," with reference to this proverb, for that which is here said of the ruling over the passion of anger is true of all affections and passions.<p>"Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules<p>Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king<p>Which every wise and virtuous man attains."<p>(Note: Milton's Paradise Regained, ii.-466-8.)<p>On the other side, the comparison is suggested:<p>Break your head, not so sore;<p>Break your will - that is more.<p>(Note: "Zerbrich den Kopf dir nicht so sehr; Zerbreich den Willen - das ist mehr." - Matth. Claudius)</body></html>
