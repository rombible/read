God sets himself at a distance from those who set him at defiance. 30. How delightful to the humbled soul to hear the good report of salvation by the Lord Jesus Christ! 31. Faithful, friendly reproofs help spiritual life, and lead to eternal life. 32. Sinners undervalue their own souls; therefore they prefer the body before the soul, and wrong the soul to please the body. 33. The fear of the Lord will dispose us to search the Scriptures with reverence; and it will cause us to follow the leadings of the Holy Spirit.

Not so much the visive power, the faculty of seeing, a strong and clear eyesight; though this is a great mercy, and from the Lord, and to be prized, and does give joy of heart; but rather the objects seen by the light of the eyes, as Jarchi; as green gardens, flowing rivers, pleasant meadows, rising hills, lowly vales, herbs, plants, trees, birds, beasts, and creatures of every kind; nor is the eye ever satisfied with seeing; especially light itself beheld rejoiceth the heart, and particularly that grand luminary and fountain of light, the sun. "Light is sweet", says the wise man, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a>, "and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun", which is a proper comment on this text: and much more pleasant and delightful, cheering and rejoicing, must be the spiritual light of the eyes of the understanding, when opened by the Spirit of God at conversion; it is marvellous light souls are then called into, and wonderful things do they then behold, which rejoice their hearts; as Christ the sun of righteousness himself, the light of the world, the glories of his person and office, the fulness of grace that is in him, pardon of sin by his blood, justification by his righteousness, and free and full salvation through him for the worst and chief of sinners: in the light which is thrown into them they see light; the light of God's countenance, his face and favour, which put gladness into them; the light of the divine word, and the precious truths of it; yea, the light, joy, and happiness of the world to come, in the hope of which their hearts rejoice. Jarchi mystically interprets this of the light of the eyes in the law; but it is much better to understand it of the light of the eyes in the Gospel, and the mysteries of it; <p>and a good report maketh the bones fat; or "a good hearing" (w); not the sense of hearing, or a quick exercise of that, though a very great blessing; but things heard. Some understand this of a good or "fame" (x), which is sometimes the sense of the phrase; either a good report which a man hears of himself, which makes his spirit cheerful; and this affects his body and the juices of it, which fill his bones with marrow, and cover them with fatness; or which he hears of his friends, and is pleasing to him, as it was to the Apostle John that Demetrius had a good report of all men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-12.htm">3 John 1:12</a>. But rather this is to be understood of the good news, or good hearing, from a far country, as the same phrase is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-25.htm">Proverbs 25:25</a>; and here in the Arabic version is so translated, even the Gospel, which is a report; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>; a report concerning God, the perfections of his nature, the purposes of his heart, the covenant of his grace, his love, grace, and mercy towards men in Christ Jesus; a "report" concerning Christ, concerning his person and offices, concerning his incarnation, obedience, sufferings, and death; concerning his resurrection, ascension, sitting at the right hand of God, intercession for his people, and second coming to judgment; and concerning salvation, peace, pardon, righteousness, and eternal life by him; a report concerning the good land, the heavenly Canaan, and the glories of it, the way unto it, and the persons that shall possess it: and this is a "good" report; it is good tidings of good things, a report of good things laid up in covenant, which are come by Christ the great High Priest, which saints are interested in, and shall partake of here and hereafter; it is a true report, and to be believed, since it is made by God himself, by Jesus Christ the faithful witness, and by the apostles of Christ, who were eye and ear witnesses of the things they reported; and such a report being heard, received, and embraced, greatly contributes to the spiritual health and prosperity of the children of God, it makes them fat and flourishing; such pleasant words are as the honeycomb, sweet to the soul, make glad the heart, and are marrow and health to the bones; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a>. <p>(w)  "auditus bona", Vatablus; "auditio bona", Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius.

LORD, lift you up the light of your countenance on us.">Psalm 4:6</a> [Hebrews 7]; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-15.htm" title="In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain.">Proverbs 16:15</a>). “We all want to see that light in the eyes of our friends, which rejoices the heart,” Horton. Occurring, however, in a proverb, the phrase may well have a wider meaning: whatever gives light acts as a luminary (the Heb. word is rather light-bearer, <span class="greekheb">φωστήρ</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/1-14.htm" title="And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:...">Genesis 1:14-16</a>, than light, <span class="greekheb">φῶς</span>) to the eyes, casting light and brightness upon them, extends through them its influence to the heart; just as, in the following clause, whatever charms the ear (lit. <span class="bld">good hearing</span>), be it “good tidings,” R.V., or the pleasant voice of a friend, or the tender accents of affection, or the sweet strains of music, refreshes and invigorates the whole bodily frame. By the gateway of the eye and of the ear alike the citadel of the heart may be reached for good.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-15.htm">Proverbs 16:15</a>). The beaming glance that shows a pure, happy mind and a friendly disposition, rejoices the heart of him on whom it is turned. There is something infectious in the guileless, joyful look of a happy man or child, which has a cheering effect upon those who observe it. The LXX. makes the sentiment altogether personal: "The eye that seeth what is good rejoiceth the heart." <span class="cmt_word">A good report</span> (good tidings) <span class="cmt_word">maketh the bones fat;</span> strengthens them and gives them health (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>). Sight and hearing are compared in the two clauses, "bones" in the latter taking the place of "heart" in the former. The happy look and good news alike cause joy of heart. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Four proverbs of fundamentally different doctrines:<p>24 The man of understanding goeth upwards on a way of life,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To depart from hell beneath.<p>The way of life is one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a> (where, notwithstanding the want of the article, the idea is logically determined), although in itself forming a plurality of &#1488;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-19.htm">Proverbs 2:19</a>.

The O.T. reveals heaven, i.e., the state of the revelation of God in glory, yet not as the abode of saved men; the way of the dying leads, according to the O.T. representation, downwards into Shel; but the translations of Enoch and Elijah are facts which, establishing the possibility of an exception, break through the dark monotony of that representation, and, as among the Greeks the mysteries encouraged &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, so in Israel the Chokma appears pointing the possessor of wisdom upwards, and begins to shed light on the darkness of Shel by the new great thoughts of a life of immortality, thus of a &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-28.htm">Proverbs 12:28</a>) (Psychologie, p. 407ff.), now for the first time becoming prominent, but only as a foreboding and an enigma. The idea of the Shel opens the way for a change: the gathering place of all the living on this side begins to be the place of punishment for the godless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-27.htm">Proverbs 7:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-18.htm">Proverbs 9:18</a>); the way leading upwards, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;, and that leading downwards, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13</a>.), come into direct contrast. </body></html>
