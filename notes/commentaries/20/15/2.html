As the heart of a wise and good man is filled with useful knowledge, civil, moral, spiritual, and evangelical; so he takes care to communicate it, at proper times and seasons, in proper places, and to proper persons; adapting it to their case and circumstances, so as it may be for their comfort, edification, and instruction, and minister grace unto them; which is using knowledge "well", as the word (s) signifies: such an use of it recommends it, and makes it appear beautiful and lovely, decorates and adorns it. Thus every good man, out of the good treasure of knowledge in his heart, brings forth his good things seasonably, to the use of edifying; in like manner, ministers of the word, scribes well instructed in the things of God, bring forth both new and old, to the profit of those to whom they minister; so Christ, as man and Mediator, had the tongue of the learned, to speak a word in season to weary souls; <p>but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness; their knowledge, as they take it to be, but it is no other than folly; this they throw out in great plenty, in a hurry, without fear or wit; they "babble" it out, as the word (t) signifies, as water out of a fountain; their hearts are full of it, and their mouths proclaim it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-23.htm">Proverbs 12:23</a>. <p>(s) "utitur bene", Castalio; "pulchre", Vatablus.

The wise man not only has knowledge, but can give it appropriate expression (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-23.htm">Proverbs 16:23</a>). Vulgate, "The tongue of the wise adorneth wisdom." The wise man, by producing his sentiments and opinions in appropriate language and on proper occasions, commends wisdom, and renders it acceptable to his hearers. Septuagint, "The tongue of the wise knoweth what is fair (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">But the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness</span> (ver. 28).

Po. (lxx), but the part. Kal (for which 21b has the part. Po. &#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503;). The predicates &#1495;&#1512;&#1507; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; (vid., regarding the perf.

The showing of forbearance and kindness to the poor arising from a common relation to one Creator, and from respect towards a personality bearing the image of God, is a conception quite in the spirit of the Chokma, which, as in the Jahve religion it becomes the universal religion, so in the national law it becomes the human. Thus also <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-15.htm">Job 31:15</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a> of the Epistle of James, which in many respects has its roots in the Book of Proverbs. Mat 25:40 is a New Testament side-piece to 31b. </body></html>
