Secret sins, services, and sorrows, are under God's eye. This speaks comfort to saints, and terror to sinners. 4. A good tongue is healing to wounded consciences, by comforting them; to sin-sick souls, by convincing them; and it reconciles parties at variance. 5. If instruction is despised, reprove men rather than suffer them to go on undisturbed in the way to ruin. 6. The wealth of worldly men increases their fears and suspicions, adds strength to their passions, and renders the fear of death more distressing. 7. We use knowledge aright when we disperse it; but the heart of the foolish has nothing to disperse that is good. 8,9. The wicked put other things in the stead of Christ's atonement, or in the place of holy obedience. Praying graces are his gift, and the work of his Spirit, with which he is well pleased. 10.

The right way, the way of God; the way of his commandments: the Vulgate Latin version is, "the way of life"; the same with the way of righteousness, which apostates, having known and walked in, turn aside from; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>. And such deserve severe correction, the chastisement of a cruel one, correction in wrath and hot displeasure; which, when they have, is very disagreeable to them; they behave under it like a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke, and yet they are but dealt righteously with. Or the words may be rendered, "he has had bad discipline" or "instruction (z) that forsakes the way"; due care has not been taken of him; he has not been properly instructed, nor seasonably corrected; had he, he would not easily have departed from the way in which he should go; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>. The Targum is, <p>"the discipline of an evil man causes his way to err;'' <p>or him to err from his way; <p>and he that hateth reproof shall die; that hates the reproof of parents, masters, and ministers of the word; as he may be said to do that neglects and rejects it, and does not act agreeably to it: and such a man, dying in impenitence and without faith in Christ, dies in his sins; and sometimes shamefully, or a shameful death, as the Septuagint and Arabic versions, or an untimely one; as well as dies the second death, an eternal one. <p>(z)  "fuit illi mala disciplina, vel castigatio", Baynus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Correction <i>is</i> grievous to him that <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> forsaketh the way: <i>and</i> he that hateth reproof shall die.</span><p>(c) He who swears from the word of God, cannot stand to be admonished.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">Correction</span> is <span class="ital">grievous unto</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">There is grievous correction for</span>, as R.V.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way.</span> The verse is climacteric, and the first clause is better translated, <span class="accented">There is a grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way</span>; then the second clause denotes what that correction is: <span class="cmt_word">he that hateth reproof</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he that forsaketh the way - <span class="cmt_word">shall die.</span> "The way" is the path of goodness and righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-13.htm">Proverbs 2:13</a>). "The way of life." the Vulgate calls it; so <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-17.htm">Proverbs 10:17</a>. Ecclesiastes 21:6, "He that hateth reproof is in the way of sinners." The Authorized Version is quite allowable, and is supported in some degree by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Doctrina mala deserenti viam vitae.</span> The sinner is annoyed by discipline, correction, or true teaching, because they curb the indulgence of his passions, make him uneasy in conscience, and force him to look to future issues. Septuagint, "The instruction of the guileless (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) is known by passers-by; but they who hate reproofs die shamefully."

Gentleness characterizes the tongue when all that it says to a neighbour, whether it be instruction or correction, or warning or consolation, it says in a manner without rudeness, violence, or obtrusiveness, by which it finds the easiest and surest acceptance, because he feels the goodwill, the hearty sympathy, the humility of him who is conscious of his own imperfection. Such gentleness is a tree of life, whose fruits preserve life, heal the sick, and raise up the bowed down. Accordingly, &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; is to be understood of the effect which goes forth from perversity or falseness of the tongue upon others. Fleischer translates: asperitas autem in ea animum vulnerat, and remarks, "&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512; &#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1495;, abstr. pro concreto. The verb &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;, and the n. verbale &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512; derived from it, may, in order to render the meaning tropical, govern the prep. &#1489;&#1468;, as the Arab. kaser bak&#803;lby, he has broken my heart (opp. Arab. jabar bak&#803;laby), cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-29.htm">Proverbs 21:29</a>, vid., De Glossis Habichtianis, p. 18; yet it also occurs with the accus., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-21.htm">Psalm 69:21</a>, and the corresponding gen. &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-14.htm">Isaiah 65:14</a>." In any case, the breaking (deep wounding) is not meant in regard to his own spirit, but to that of the neighbour. Rightly Luther: but a lying (tongue) makes heart-sorrow (elsewhere, a false one troubles the cheerful); Euchel: a false tongue is soul-wounding; and the translation of the year 1844: falsehood is a breach into the heart. Only for curiosity's sake are two other interpretations of 4a and 4b mentioned: the means of safety to the tongue is the tree of life, i.e., The Tor (Erachin 15b); and: perversity suffers destruction by a breath of wind, after the proverb, &#1499;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1493; &#1490;&#1505;&#1493;&#1514; &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1511;&#1497;&#1502;&#1506;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1493;, a breath of wind breaks a man who is puffed up<p>(Note: Vid., Duke's Rabbinische Blumenlese, p. 176, where the rendering is somewhat different.)<p>(which Meri presents for choice, vid., also Rashi, who understands &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; of the storm of judgment). The lxx translates, in 4b, a different text: &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; but the &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; here supposed cannot mean "to be full of spirit," but rather "to eat full of wind." Otherwise the Syr. and Targ.: and he who eateth of his own fruit is satisfied (Heb. &#1493;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;) - an attempt to give to the phrase &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; a thought correct in point of language, but one against which we do not give up the Masoretic text.</body></html>
