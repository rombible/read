He that is slow to anger, not only prevents strife, but appeases it, if kindled. 19. Those who have no heart to their work, pretend that they cannot do their work without hardship and danger. And thus many live always in doubt about their state, because always in neglect of some duty. 20. Those who treat an aged mother or a father with contempt or neglect, show their own folly. 21. Such as are truly wise, study that their thoughts, words, and actions should be regular, sincere, and holy. 22.

This, as Aben Ezra observes, is to be understood of a wicked man, as the opposition in the next clause shows; <p>but the way of the righteous is made plain: it is a castup way, as the word (p) signifies; a causeway, a highway, and a plain one, in which a truly righteous and good man finds no difficulty; yea, it is so plain, that men, though fools in other respects, shall not err therein, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8</a>; nor is it grievous and troublesome, but, on the contrary, very delightful, as the ways of Christ and wisdom are; his commandments are not grievous, his yoke is easy, and his paths pleasant; and the righteous man walks at liberty and with pleasure in them; and without offence or stumbling, as the Vulgate Latin version renders it. <p>(p) "aggestum", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator; "eleveta", Mercerus, Gejerus; "strata", Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The way of the slothful <i>man is</i> as an hedge of <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> thorns: but the way of the righteous <i>is</i> made plain.</span><p>(e) That is, he always finds some hinderance or stay, and dares not go forward.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">a hedge of thorns</span>] which may be either of his own making (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/24-30.htm" title="I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;...">Proverbs 24:30-31</a>), or of his own imagining (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-13.htm" title="The slothful man said, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.">Proverbs 22:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">made plain</span>] “Heb. <span class="ital">raised up as a causey</span>” (archaic form of <span class="ital">causeway</span>), A.V. marg.; <span class="ital">made a high way</span>, R.V.

The word for "thorn" here is <span class="accented">chedek.</span> It occurs elsewhere only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-4.htm">Micah 7:4</a>, where the Authorized Version has "briar;" but the particular plant intended is not ascertained. Most writers consider it to be some spinous specimen of the <span class="accented">solanum.</span> The word refers, it is thought, to a class of plants the name of one of which, at least, the miscalled "apple of Sodom," is well known in poetry, and is a proverbial expression for anything which promises fair but utterly disappoints on trial. "This plant, which is really a kind of potato, grows everywhere in the warmer parts of Palestine, rising to a widely branching shrub from three to five feet high; the wood thickly set with spines; the flower like that of the potato, and the fruit, which is larger than the potato apple, perfectly round, and changing from yellow to bright red as it ripens.... The <span class="accented">osher</span> of the Arab is the true apple of Sodom. A very tropical-looking plant, its fruit is like a large smooth apple or orange, and hangs in clusters of three or four together. When ripe, it is yellow, and looks fair and attractive, and is soft to the touch, but if pressed, it bursts with a crack, and only the broken shell and a raw of small seeds in a half-open pod, with a few dry filaments, remain in the hand" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' 2:74, 117). Cato, 'Dist.,' 54:3, 5 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Segnitiem fugito, quae vitae ignavia fertur;<br />Nam quum animus languet, consumit inertia corpus."</span> To the sluggard is opposed the righteous in the second member, because indolence is a grievous sin, and the greatest contrast to the active industry of the man who fears God and does his duty. <span class="cmt_word">The way of the righteous is made plain;</span> "is a raised causeway;" <span class="accented">selulah</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-17.htm">Proverbs 16:17</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>. The upright man, who treads the path appointed for him resolutely and trustfully, finds all difficulties vanish; before him the thorns yield a passage; and that which the sluggard regarded as dangerous and impassable becomes to him as the king's highway. Vulgate, "The path of the just is without impediment;" Septuagint, "The roads of the manly (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) are well beaten." St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 30:51), "Whatever adversity may have fallen in their way of life, the righteous stumble not against it. Because with the bound of eternal hope, and of eternal contemplation, they leap over the obstacles of temporal adversity" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-29.htm">Psalm 18:29</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>13 A joyful heart maketh the countenance cheerful;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.<p>The expression of the countenance, as well as the spiritual habitus of a man, is conditioned by the state of the heart.

The &#1489; of &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514; is, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-1.htm">Proverbs 17:1</a>, meant in the force of being together or along with, so that &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;&#1492; do not need to be taken separate from each other as subject and predicate: the sense of the noun-clause is in the &#1489;, as e.g., also <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-23.htm">Proverbs 7:23</a> (it is about his life, i.e., it concerns his life). Elsewhere the crushed spirit, like the broken heart, is equivalent to the heart despairing in itself and prepared for grace. The heart with a more clouded mien may be well, for sorrow has in it a healing power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:3</a>). But here the matter is the general psychological truth, that the corporeal and spiritual life of man has its regulator in the heart, and that the condition of the heart leaves its stamp on the appearance and on the activity of the man. The translation of the &#1512;&#1493;&#1495; &#1504;&#1499;&#1488;&#1492; by "oppressed breath" (Umbreit, Hitzig) is impossible; the breath cannot be spoken of as broken.</body></html>
