Believers often have enough when worldly eyes see little; the Lord is with them, without the cares, troubles, and temptations which are with the wealth of the wicked. 18. He that is slow to anger, not only prevents strife, but appeases it, if kindled. 19. Those who have no heart to their work, pretend that they cannot do their work without hardship and danger. And thus many live always in doubt about their state, because always in neglect of some duty. 20. Those who treat an aged mother or a father with contempt or neglect, show their own folly. 21. Such as are truly wise, study that their thoughts, words, and actions should be regular, sincere, and holy. 22. If men will not take time and pains to deliberate, they are not likely to bring any thing to pass. 23. Wisdom is needed to suit our discourse to the occasions. 24.

Of "the way of life"; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-17.htm">Proverbs 10:17</a>; this is said to be "above", or it tends "to what is above"; it leads to heaven and happiness above; the life itself it is the way of or to is above, it is hid with Christ in God; eternal life, glory, and happiness, is above; it is a house eternal in the heavens, an inheritance reserved there, and will be there enjoyed by the saints: the way to it is above; Christ is the way, and he is in heaven, at the Father's right hand, through whom only men can come at this life; wherefore those who are in the way of it have their thoughts, their hearts, their affections and conversations, above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-21.htm">Matthew 6:21</a>. Faith, which deals with Christ the way, and by which men walk in him, is signified by soaring aloft, mounting up with wings as eagles, by entering within the vail, and dwelling on high, and by looking upwards, and at things unseen, and being the evidence of them. The Vulgate Latin version renders it, "the way of life is above the learned man", or wise man; the man that has no other than natural learning and wisdom, this way of life and salvation by Christ lies out of his knowledge; it is what the most sagacious and penetrating man could never discover; it is hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed to babes; or this is only known to such who are truly wise unto salvation; it is plain to them, and they highly esteem it, and choose to walk in it; it is an "ascent to him that understands", as the Syriac version renders it; it is a going up hill, it is an ascending upwards and heavenwards; such a man is continually looking upwards unto Christ, the author and finisher of his faith; pressing towards him, the mark for the prize; keeping his eye, not on things on earth, things temporal, which are seen here below, but on things above, things unseen, which are eternal in the heavens; <p>that he may depart from hell beneath; not from the grave, as "sheol" sometimes signifies: for wise men die as well as fools, and come to the grave, which is the house appointed for all living; even those who are in the way of life that is above do not escape death and the grave: but such are secured from everlasting ruin and destruction, from being destroyed soul and body in hell; they steer quite a different course and road from that; every step they take upwards carries them so far off from hell; which is the contrary way; the broad road of sin is the lower way, or what leads to hell and destruction beneath; the narrow way of faith in Christ is the upper way, and that leads to eternal life above. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">above</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">upward</span>.

The path may be steep and painful, but at any rate it has this compensation - it leads away from destruction. It is obvious to read into the passage higher teaching. The good man's path leads heavenward, to a high life here, to happiness hereafter; his conversation is in heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>), his affections are set on things above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>). Such an upward life tends to material and spiritual health, as it is added, <span class="cmt_word">that he may depart from hell</span> (<span class="accented">SheoI</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>beneath</span>. Primarily, a long and happy life is promised to the man who fears the Lord, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-16.htm">Proverbs 3:16</a>; secondarily, such a one avoids that downward course which ends in the darkness of hell. Vulgate, "The path of life is above the instructed man, to make him avoid the nethermost (<span class="accented">novissimo</span>) hell;" Septuagint, "The thoughts of the prudent man are the ways of life, that turning from Hades he may be safe." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Two proverbs of two different classes of men, each second line of which terminates with a catchword having a similar sound (&#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1498;, &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1495;).<p>18 A passionate man stirreth up strife,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And one who is slow to anger allayeth contention.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-25.htm">Proverbs 28:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-22.htm">Proverbs 29:22</a> are variations of the first line of this proverb. The Pih. &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; occurs only these three times in the phrase &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; &#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, R. &#1490;&#1512;, to grind, thus to strike, to irritate, cogn. to (but of a different root from) the verb &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1512;, to excite, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>, and &#1495;&#1512;&#1495;&#1512;, to set on fire, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-21.htm">Proverbs 26:21</a>, cf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14</a>. Regarding &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>; we call such a man a "hot-head;" but the biblical conception nowhere (except in the Book of Daniel) places the head in connection with spiritual-psychical events (Psychologie, p. 254). Regarding &#1488;&#1512;&#1498; &#1488;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a>; the lxx (which contains a translation of this proverb, and after it of a variation) translates &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#837;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;, i.e., (as the Syr. render it) he suppresses the strife in its origin, so that it does not break out. But both are true: that he who is slow to anger, who does not thus easily permit himself to become angry, allayeth the strife which one enters into with him, or into which he is drawn, and that he prevents the strife, for he places over against provoking, injurious conduct, patient gentleness (&#1502;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>). </body></html>
