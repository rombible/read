A wise man seeks to gain more wisdom, growing in grace and in the knowledge of Christ. But a carnal mind rests contented, flattering itself. 15. Some are much in affliction, and of a sorrowful spirit. Such are to be pitied, prayed for, and comforted. And others serve God with gladness of heart, and it prompts their obedience, yet they should rejoice with trembling.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Some prefer to render the last clause, "In sorrow of heart the breath is oppressed." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

The sacrifice, as a material and legally-required performance, is much more related to dead works than prayer freely completing itself in the word, the most direct expression of the personality, which, although not commanded by the law, because natural to men, as such is yet the soul of all sacrifices; and the Chokma, like the Psalms and Prophets, in view of the ceremonial service which had become formal and dead in the opus operatum, is to such a degree penetrated by the knowledge of the incongruity of the offering up of animals and of plants, with the object in view, that a proverb like "the sacrifice of the righteous is pleasing to God" never anywhere occurs; and if it did occur without being expressly and unavoidably referred to the legal sacrifice, it would have to be understood rather after <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>. than <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-20.htm">Psalm 51:20</a>f., rather after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> than after <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/66-13.htm">Psalm 66:13-15</a>. &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;, which, when it is distinguished from &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, means (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14</a>) the sacrifice only in part coming to the altar, for the most part applied to a sacrificial feast, is here the common name for the bloody, and, per synecdochen, generally the legally-appointed sacrifice, consisting in external offering. The &#1500;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>, used in the Tra of sacrifices, is here, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/19-15.htm">Psalm 19:15</a>, transferred to prayer. The fundamental idea of the proverb is, that sacrifices well-pleasing to God, prayers acceptable to God (that are heard, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-29.htm">Proverbs 15:29</a>), depend on the relations in which the heart and life of the man stand to God.</body></html>
