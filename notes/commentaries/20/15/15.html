A wise man seeks to gain more wisdom, growing in grace and in the knowledge of Christ. But a carnal mind rests contented, flattering itself. 15. Some are much in affliction, and of a sorrowful spirit. Such are to be pitied, prayed for, and comforted. And others serve God with gladness of heart, and it prompts their obedience, yet they should rejoice with trembling.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Afflicted - The affliction meant here is less that of outward circumstances than of a troubled and downcast spirit.

And some are afflicted all their days, from their youth up; so that not only the days of old age are evil days, in which they have no pleasure, but even the days of their youth; all their days, as Jacob says, "few and evil have the days of the years of my life been", <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>; because they had been filled up with affliction and trouble of one sort or another. Or, "all the days of the poor" (f); either in purse, who want many of the good things of life; or in knowledge, as Gersom and Aben Ezra observe; <p>but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast; a heart that has "the kingdom of God" in it, which lies "not in meat and drink, but in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost", <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>, which has the love of God shed abroad in it by the Spirit, where Christ dwells by faith; and that lives by faith on him, and on the provisions of his grace; all this is a constant continual feast to a gracious soul, made joyful hereby. <p>(f) "pauperis", V.

The Vulgate <span class="accented">pauperis</span> gives a wrong impression. The persons intended are such as take a gloomy view of things, who are always in low spirits, and cannot rise superior to present circumstances. These never have a happy moment; they are always taking anxious thought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>), and forecasting evil. The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>, translates, "At all times the eyes of the evil expect evil." <span class="cmt_word">But he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.</span> The cheerful man's condition is a banquet unceasingly, a fixed state of joy and contentment. Septuagint, "But the righteous are at peace always;" Vulgate, "A secure mind is like a perpetual feast." "For," says St. Gregory ('Moral,' 12:44), "the mere repose of security is like the continuance of refreshment. Whereas, on the other hand, the evil mind is always set in pains and labours, since it is either contriving mischiefs that it may bring down, or fearing lest these be brought down upon it by others." Our own proverb says, "A contented mind is a continual feast." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Another proverb with the key-word &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1514;<p>An abomination to Jahve is the way of the godless;<p>But He loveth him who searcheth after righteousness.<p>The manner and rule of life is called the way. &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507; is the heightening of &#1512;&#1491;&#1507;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-21.htm">Proverbs 21:21</a>, and can be used independently in bonam, as well as in malam partem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-19.htm">Proverbs 11:19</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-21.htm">Proverbs 13:21</a>).
