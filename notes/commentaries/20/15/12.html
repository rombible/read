He that makes a jest of religion; scoffs at godliness and godly men; treats the Gospel and the ministers of it with contempt; makes a mock at good men, and all that is good; a pestilent fellow, as the Vulgate Latin version: such an one not only does not love, for more is intended than is expressed; but hates him that reproves him, and especially if publicly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10</a>; he thinks ill of him; bears him a grudge, and abhors him; and speaks evil of him, and reproaches him; and does all he can to the injury of his person and name; hence the advice of the wise man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-7.htm">Proverbs 9:7</a>. Some render it, he "loves not reproving himself", or "to reprove himself" (b); he does not care to look into his own heart and ways, or to call himself to an account for what he does; nor to check himself in the pursuit of sin, nor argue with and reprove himself for it; <p>neither will he go unto the wise; to the private houses of wise and good men; nor to the house of wisdom, or place of public instruction, where wise dispensers of the word give good advice and counsel; scorners do not choose to go to either, lest they should be reproved for their evil ways, and be advised leave them; neither of which is agreeable to them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-20.htm">John 3:20</a>. <p>(b)  "corripere", Gejerus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">one that reproveth him</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">to be reproved</span>, R.V.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/9-8.htm">Proverbs 9:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-10.htm">Amos 5:10</a>).

We may not interpret &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, with Fleischer, Bertheau, and Zckler, as accus.: in the house (cf. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-2.htm">Proverbs 8:2</a>), nor prepositionally as chez  equals  casa; but: "the house of the righteous is a great store," equivalent to, the place of such. On the contrary, destruction comes by the gain of the wicked. It is impossible that &#1504;&#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; can have the house as the subject (Lwenstein), for &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is everywhere mas. Therefore Abulwald, followed by Kimchi and the Venet. (&#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), interprets &#1504;&#1506;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514; as subst., after the form of the Mishnic &#1504;&#1489;&#1512;&#1499;&#1514;, a pool, cf. &#1504;&#1495;&#1512;&#1510;&#1492;, peremptorily decided, decreed; and if we do not extinguish the &#1489; of &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; (the lxx according to the second translation of this doubly-translated distich, Syr., and Targ.), there remains then nothing further than to regard &#1504;&#1506;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514; either as subst. neut. overturned  equals  overthrow (cf. such part. nouns as &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1491;&#1492;, &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1492;, but particularly &#1504;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-15.htm">2 Chronicles 10:15</a>), or as impers. neut. pass.: it is overthrown  equals  there is an overthrow, like &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-3.htm">Psalm 50:3</a> : it is stormed  equals  a storm rages. The gain of the wicked has overthrow as its consequence, for the greed of gain, which does not shrink from unrighteous, deceitful gain, destroys his house, &#1506;&#1499;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a> (vid., regarding &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-29.htm">Proverbs 11:29</a>). Far from enriching the house, such gain is the cause of nothing but ruin. The lxx, in its first version of this distich, reads, in 6a, &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;), and in 6b, &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1504;&#1506;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512; (and together with the fruit the godless is rooted out, &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;); for, as Lagarde has observed, it confounds &#1506;&#1499;&#1512; with &#1506;&#1511;&#1512; (to root, privativ: to root up). </body></html>
