Secret sins, services, and sorrows, are under God's eye. This speaks comfort to saints, and terror to sinners. 4. A good tongue is healing to wounded consciences, by comforting them; to sin-sick souls, by convincing them; and it reconciles parties at variance. 5. If instruction is despised, reprove men rather than suffer them to go on undisturbed in the way to ruin. 6. The wealth of worldly men increases their fears and suspicions, adds strength to their passions, and renders the fear of death more distressing. 7. We use knowledge aright when we disperse it; but the heart of the foolish has nothing to disperse that is good. 8,9. The wicked put other things in the stead of Christ's atonement, or in the place of holy obedience. Praying graces are his gift, and the work of his Spirit, with which he is well pleased. 10. He that hates reproof shall perish in his sins, since he would not be parted from them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not so - The word translated "so" is taken by some in its etymological force as "strong," "firm," and the passage is rendered "the heart of the fool disperseth (supplied from the first clause) what is weak and unsteady," i. e., "falsehood and unwisdom." The Septuagint takes it as an adjective, "the heart of the fool is unstedfast." The phrase as it stands in the King James Version is, however, of frequent occurrence <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-18.htm">Genesis 48:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-11.htm">Exodus 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8, 9.

The way his heart devises, which he chooses and delights in, in which he walks; nor will he leave it, nor can he be diverted from it, but by the powerful grace of God. This is a way not good, but evil, and so an abomination to the Lord; and the whole tenor and course of his life, which is meant by his way being evil: hence his sacrifices, and all his external duties of religion performed by him, are abominable to the Lord; for, while he continues in a course of sin, all his religious exercises will be of no avail, cannot be pleasing and acceptable to God; <p>but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness; either after a justifying righteousness; not the righteousness of the law, which the carnal Jews followed after, but did not attain unto; nor is righteousness to be had by the works of the law, nor any justification by it, nor can a man be acceptable to God on account of it; but the righteousness of Christ, which he has wrought out, and is revealed in the Gospel: to follow after this supposes a want of one; a sense of that want; a view of the glory, fulness, suitableness, and excellency of Christ's righteousness; an eager desire after it, sometimes expressed by hungering and thirsting after it, as here by a pursuit of it; which means no other than an earnest and importunate request to be found in it: and such, as they shall be satisfied or filled with it, so they are loved by the Lord, and are acceptable to him through the righteousness they are seeking after: or else it may be understood of following after true holiness of heart and life, without which there is no seeing the Lord; and though perfection in it is not attainable in this live, yet a gracious soul presses after it, which is well pleasing in the sight of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - This verse gives the reason for the treatment specified in the preceding verse (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-20.htm">Proverbs 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Followeth after</span>; <span class="accented">chaseth</span>, implying effort and perseverance, as in the pursuit of game (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-19.htm">Proverbs 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-21.htm">Proverbs 21:21</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>3 The eyes of Jahve are in every place,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Observing the evil and the good.<p>The connection of the dual &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; with the plur. of the adjective, which does not admit of a dual, is like <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a>, cf. 18. But the first line is a sentence by itself, to which the second line gives a closer determination, as showing how the eyes of God are everywhere (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>) abroad over the whole earth, viz., beholding with penetrating look the evil and the good (&#1510;&#1508;&#1492;, to hold to, to observe, cf. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, Sir. 23:19), i.e., examining men whether they are good or evil, and keeping them closely before His eyes, so that nothing escapes him. This universal inspection, this omniscience of God, has an alarming but also a comforting side. The proverb seeks first to warn, therefore it speaks first of the evil.</body></html>
