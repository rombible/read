Secret sins, services, and sorrows, are under God's eye. This speaks comfort to saints, and terror to sinners. 4. A good tongue is healing to wounded consciences, by comforting them; to sin-sick souls, by convincing them; and it reconciles parties at variance. 5. If instruction is despised, reprove men rather than suffer them to go on undisturbed in the way to ruin. 6. The wealth of worldly men increases their fears and suspicions, adds strength to their passions, and renders the fear of death more distressing. 7. We use knowledge aright when we disperse it; but the heart of the foolish has nothing to disperse that is good. 8,9. The wicked put other things in the stead of Christ's atonement, or in the place of holy obedience. Praying graces are his gift, and the work of his Spirit, with which he is well pleased. 10. He that hates reproof shall perish in his sins, since he would not be parted from them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not so - The word translated "so" is taken by some in its etymological force as "strong," "firm," and the passage is rendered "the heart of the fool disperseth (supplied from the first clause) what is weak and unsteady," i. e., "falsehood and unwisdom." The Septuagint takes it as an adjective, "the heart of the fool is unstedfast."

Scatter it about for the benefit of others; they are communicative and diffusive of it unto others, that fruit may abound to their account: so the first ministers of the Gospel diffused the savour of the knowledge of Christ and his Gospel in every place; their words went into all the earth, and their sound to the end of the world; and so every Gospel minister will speak according to the oracles of God, and according to the abilities and measure of the gift which he has received; and to the utmost of his power feeds souls with knowledge and understanding; <p>but the heart of the foolish doth not so; does not disperse knowledge, for he has no solid substantial knowledge in him: or, "the heart of the foolish is not right" (x); it is full of folly and wickedness: or "the heart of the foolish does not disperse that which is right" (y); true and right things, and the knowledge of them; but, on the contrary, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>, "pours out foolishness". <p>(x)  "non erit rectum", Pagninus, Baynus; "non est rectum", Piscator, Mercerus.

The LXX. takes the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> in its other signification of "binding" or "embracing," and translates, "The lips of the wise are bound (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) with knowledge;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> knowledge is always on them and controls their movements. The wise know when to speak, when to be silent, and what to say. <span class="cmt_word">But the heart of the foolish doeth not so</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> doth not disperse knowledge. Vulgate, <span class="accented">cor stultorum dissimile erit</span>, "will be unlike," which probably means the same as the Authorized Version. (Compare a similar use of the words <span class="accented">lo-ken</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-18.htm">Genesis 48:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-11.htm">Exodus 10:11</a>.) But the contrast is stated rather weakly by this rendering, lips and heart having the same office to perform; hence it is better, with Delitzsch, Ewald, and others, to take <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">ken</span>) as an adjective in the sense of "right" or "trustworthy," and either to supply the former verb, "disperseth that which is not right," or to render, "The heart of the foot  is not directed right;" the fool goes astray, and leads himself and others into error. Septuagint, "The hearts of fools are not safe (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>)." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>1 A soft answer turneth away wrath,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And a bitter word stirreth up anger.<p>In the second line, the common word for anger (&#1488;&#1507;, from the breathing with the nostrils, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-17.htm">Proverbs 14:17</a>) is purposely placed, but in the first, that which denotes anger in the highest degree (&#1495;&#1502;&#1492; from &#1497;&#1495;&#1501;, cogn. &#1495;&#1502;&#1501;, Arab. hamiya, to glow, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; from &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503;): a mild, gentle word turns away the heat of anger (excandescentiam), puts it back, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-15.htm">Proverbs 25:15</a>. The Dagesh in &#1512;&#1468;&#1498; follows the rule of the &#1491;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;, i.e., of the close connection of a word terminating with the accented eh, aah, ah with the following word (Michlol 63b). The same is the meaning of the Latin proverb:<p>Frangitur ira gravis<p>Quando est responsio suavis.<p>The &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1470;&#1506;&#1510;&#1489; produces the contrary effect. This expression does not mean an angry word (Ewald), for &#1506;&#1510;&#1489; is not to be compared with the Arab. ghad&#803;ab, anger (Umbreit), but with Arab. 'ad&#803;b, cutting, wounding, paining (Hitzig), so that &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1502;&#1506;&#1510;&#1497;&#1489; is meant in the sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40</a> : a word which causes pain (lxx &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, Theod. &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;), not after the meaning, a word provoking to anger (Gesenius), but certainly after its effect, for a wounding word "makes anger arise." As one says of anger &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, "it turns itself" (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-11.htm">Isaiah 9:11</a>), so, on the other hand, &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, "it rises up," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>.
