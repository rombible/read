Believers often have enough when worldly eyes see little; the Lord is with them, without the cares, troubles, and temptations which are with the wealth of the wicked. 18. He that is slow to anger, not only prevents strife, but appeases it, if kindled. 19. Those who have no heart to their work, pretend that they cannot do their work without hardship and danger. And thus many live always in doubt about their state, because always in neglect of some duty. 20. Those who treat an aged mother or a father with contempt or neglect, show their own folly. 21. Such as are truly wise, study that their thoughts, words, and actions should be regular, sincere, and holy. 22. If men will not take time and pains to deliberate, they are not likely to bring any thing to pass. 23. Wisdom is needed to suit our discourse to the occasions. 24. A good man sets his affections on things above; his way leads directly thither.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Probably, a special reference to debates in council <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>.

When his advice is asked, and he gives good and wholesome counsel, and that being taken succeeds; it is a pleasure to a man that he is capable of assisting his friend, and doing him service, or a common good, whether it be in things natural, civil, or religious; when his speech is with salt, seasoned with grace, and he knows how he ought to answer every man; when that which is good proceeds from him, and is to the use of edifying, and ministers grace to the hearers, and is acceptable to them; when with readiness he gives an answer to every man that asks him a reason of the hope that is in him, with meekness and fear, <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-6.htm">Colossians 3:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>; <p>and a word spoken in due season, how good is it? whether by way of advice and counsel to such who stand in need of it, or of exhortation and instruction to those that want it, or of comfort to those that are distressed; such is a word of promise spoken and applied by the Spirit of God to the hearts of his people in a time of need; and such is the Gospel of peace, pardon, righteousness, and salvation, as spoken by Christ and his ministers to weary and wounded souls; it cannot be well and fully expressed how sweet, how good, how suitable, as well as seasonable, it is: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word <i>spoken</i> <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> in due season, how good <i>it is</i>!</span><p>(g) If we will that our talk be comfortable, we must wait for time and season.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">by</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">in</span>.

A counsellor gives wise and skilful advice, or makes a timely speech; and, knowing how much harm is done by rash or evil words, he naturally rejoices that he has been able to be useful, and has avoided the errors which the tongue is liable to incur. <span class="cmt_word">A word</span> spoken <span class="cmt_word">in due season,</span> <span class="accented">sermo opportunus</span>, is advice given at the right moment and in the most suitable manner, when the occasion and the interests at stake demand it (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>). The LXX. connects this verse with the preceding, and renders, "The evil man will not hearken to it (counsel), nor will he say aught in season or for the public good." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>17 Better a dish of cabbage, and love with it,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than a fatted ox together with hatred.<p>With &#1489;&#1493; is here interchanged &#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, which, used both of things and of persons, means to be there along with something.
