The frequently threatened punishment against one who removes his neighbour’s landmark, shews the offence to have been a common form of oppression.

To whom he has the utmost aversion; he sets himself against them and resists them, and will not only destroy them, but their stately houses too, which their have fancied shall continue for ever; and also their families, their children and posterity; these shall be as stubble, and shall be burnt up in his wrath, and neither root nor branch left. Moreover, the man of sin, the son of perdition, may be more especially intended, that exalts himself above all that is called God, with all the sons of pride supported by him; his house, which is the house of the foolish and adulterous woman, the idolatrous church of Rome, shall be rooted up; the city of Rome, the seat of the beast itself, where his house or palace is, shall be destroyed, and all that belong unto him, even all they that have destroyed the earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm">Revelation 11:18</a>; <p>but he will establish the border of the widow; whose advocate, judge, and defender he is; when men, rich, proud, and oppressive, attempt to remove the landmark of the widow's border, and so lessen her land and enlarge their own, God will not suffer it to be done, but will establish it in its place; that is, such who are weak and helpless, as widows are, and cannot defend themselves and their property, he will protect them and secure it for them. So the church of Christ, during the reign of antichrist, being obliged to flee into the wilderness, looks like a widow deprived of her husband, and has but "little strength" to support and defend herself, as is said of the church of Philadelphia, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-8.htm">Revelation 3:8</a>; yet the Lord will secure and preserve her, and firmly settle and establish her, yea, enlarge her borders, and make them of pleasant stones; spread the kingdom of Christ from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.

He will take the widow under his protection, and see that her landmark is not removed, and that her little portion is secured to her. The widow is taken as the type of weakness and desolation, as often in Scripture (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>). In a country where property was defined by landmarks - stones or some such objects - nothing was easier than to remove these altogether, or to alter their position. That this was a common form of fraud and oppression we gather from the stringency of the enactments against the offence (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-17.htm">Deuteronomy 27:17</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-28.htm">Proverbs 22:28</a>). In the Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions which have been preserved, there are many invoking curses, curious and multifarious, against the disturbers of boundaries. Such marks were considered sacred and inviolable by the Greeks and Romans (see Plato, 'De Leg.,' 8:842, 843; Ovid, 'Fast.,' 2:639, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>19 The way of the slothful is as hedged with thorns;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the path of the righteous is paved.<p>Hitzig misses the contrast between &#1488;&#1510;&#1500; (slothful) and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (upright), and instead of the slothful reads &#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;, the tyrannical.

The contrast is indeed not that of contradiction, but the slothful is one who does not act uprightly, a man who fails to fulfil the duty of labour common to man, and of his own special calling. The way of such an one is &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1514; &#1495;&#1491;&#1511;, like a fencing with thorns (from &#1495;&#1491;&#1511;, R. &#1495;&#1491;, to be pointed, sharp, distinguished from Arab. hadk&#803;, to surround, and in the meaning to fix with the look, denom. of khadak&#803;t, the apple of the eye), so that he goes not forwards, and sees hindrances and difficulties everywhere, which frighten him back, excusing his shunning his work, his remissness of will, and his doing nothing; on the contrary, the path of those who wait truly and honestly on their calling, and prosecute their aim, is raised up like a skilfully made street, so that unhindered and quickly they go forward (&#1505;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, R. &#1505;&#1500;, aggerare, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-15.htm">Jeremiah 18:15</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-4.htm">Isaiah 49:4</a> :8, &#1505;&#1500;&#1505;&#1500;, which was still in use in the common language of Palestine in the second cent., Rosch haschana, 26b). </body></html>
