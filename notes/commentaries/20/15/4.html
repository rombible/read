Secret sins, services, and sorrows, are under God's eye. This speaks comfort to saints, and terror to sinners. 4. A good tongue is healing to wounded consciences, by comforting them; to sin-sick souls, by convincing them; and it reconciles parties at variance. 5. If instruction is despised, reprove men rather than suffer them to go on undisturbed in the way to ruin. 6. The wealth of worldly men increases their fears and suspicions, adds strength to their passions, and renders the fear of death more distressing. 7. We use knowledge aright when we disperse it; but the heart of the foolish has nothing to disperse that is good. 8,9. The wicked put other things in the stead of Christ's atonement, or in the place of holy obedience. Praying graces are his gift, and the work of his Spirit, with which he is well pleased. 10.

A tongue that delivers out salutary instructions, wholesome advice and counsel; a "healing tongue" (w), as it may be rendered, which pacifies contending parties, and heals the divisions between them; to have the benefit of such a man's company and conversation is like being in paradise. Such is the tongue of a Gospel minister, which delivers out the wholesome words of our Lord Jesus Christ; sound speech and doctrines, which cannot be condemned; healing truths to wounded consciences, such as peace, pardon, righteousness, and atonement by the blood of Christ. These are the means of quickening dead sinners, reviving and comforting distressed ones, and show the way of eternal life unto them; <p>but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit; impure, unchaste, unsavoury, and corrupt language, does mischief to the spirits of men; evil communications corrupt the heart and manners, defile the soul and the conversation; these and unsound doctrines eat as a canker; and as they make the heart of God's people sad, whom he would not have made sad; so they bring distress and despair into the spirits of others, and make sad wounds and breaches there, which are never healed, and that both in the spirits of speakers and hearers; for damnable heresies bring swift destruction on the propagators of them, and them that receive them. <p>(w) "sanans", so some in Vatablus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">wholesome</span>] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-30.htm" title="A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.">Proverbs 14:30</a>, where the same Heb. word is rendered <span class="ital">sound</span>, and note there, and comp. <span class="greekheb">ὑγιαίνοντες λόγοι</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm" title="If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;">1 Timothy 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 1:13</a>, and <span class="greekheb">λόγος ὑγιής</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-8.htm" title="Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.">Titus 2:8</a>.

This is ruin and vexation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-14.htm">Isaiah 65:14</a>, where the same word is used) in the spirit, both in the liar himself, whose higher nature is thus terribly marred and spoiled, and in the case of his neighbour, who is injured by his slander and falsehood to the, very core. The LXX., with a different reading, translates, "But he who keepeth it [the tongue] shall be filled with the spirit." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>33 Wisdom rests in the heart of the man of understanding;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the heart of fools it maketh itself known.<p>Most interpreters know not what to make of the second line here. The lxx (and after it the Syr.), and as it appears, also Aquila and Theodotion, insert &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;; the Targ. improves the Peshito, for it inserts &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; (so that <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-23.htm">Proverbs 12:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-16.htm">Proverbs 13:16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a> are related). And Abulwald explains: in the heart of fools it is lost; Euchel: it reels about; but these are imaginary interpretations resting on a misunderstanding of the passages, in which &#1497;&#1491;&#1506; means to come to feel, and &#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506; to give to feel (to punish, correct). Kimchi rightly adheres to the one ascertained meaning of the words, according to which the Venet. &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. So also the translation of Jerome: et indoctos quosque (quoque) erudiet, is formed, for he understands the "and is manifest among fools" (Luther) not merely, as C. B. Michaelis, after the saying: opposita juxta se posita magis elucescunt, but of a becoming manifest, which is salutary to these. Certainly &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; can mean among  equals  in the circle, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-31.htm">Proverbs 15:31</a>; but if, as here and e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, &#1489;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; is interchanged with &#1489;&#1500;&#1489;, and if &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492; &#1489;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; is the subject spoken of, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-28.htm">1 Kings 3:28</a>, then &#1489;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489; does not mean among (in the midst of), but in the heart of the fool. According to this, the Talmud rightly, by comparison with the current proverb (Meza 85b): &#1488;&#1505;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;&#1500;&#1490;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488; &#1511;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1511;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488;, a stater in a flaggon cries Kish, Kish, i.e., makes much clatter. In the heart of the understanding wisdom rests, i.e., remains silent and still, for the understanding feels himself personally happy in its possession, endeavours always the more to deepen it, and lets it operate within; on the contrary, wisdom in the heart of fools makes itself manifest: they are not able to keep to themselves the wisdom which they imagine they possess, or the portion of wisdom which is in reality theirs; but they think, as it is said in Persius: Scire tuum nihil est nisi scire hoc te sciat alter. They discredit and waste their little portion of wisdom (instead of thinking on its increase) by obtrusive ostentatious babbling. </body></html>
