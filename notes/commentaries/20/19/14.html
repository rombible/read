A discreet and virtuous wife is more valuable than house and riches. 15. A sluggish, slothful disposition makes men poor; it brings them to want. And this applies both to the present life and that which is to come. 16. If we keep God's word, God's word will keep us from every thing really hurtful. We abuse the doctrine of free grace, if we think that it does away the necessity and advantage of obedience. Those that live at random must die. This truth is clearly taught in words enough to alarm the stoutest sinner. 17. God has chosen the poor of this world, to be rich in faith, and heirs of his kingdom. 18. When parents keep under foolish tenderness, they do their best to render children a comfort to them, and happy in themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Calamity - The Hebrew word is plural (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-3.htm">Psalm 91:3</a>), and seems to express the multiplied and manifold sorrow caused by the foolish son.<p>Continual dropping - The irritating, unceasing, sound of the fall, drop after drop, of water through the chinks in the roof. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.
