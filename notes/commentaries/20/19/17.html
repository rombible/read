A discreet and virtuous wife is more valuable than house and riches. 15. A sluggish, slothful disposition makes men poor; it brings them to want. And this applies both to the present life and that which is to come. 16. If we keep God's word, God's word will keep us from every thing really hurtful. We abuse the doctrine of free grace, if we think that it does away the necessity and advantage of obedience. Those that live at random must die. This truth is clearly taught in words enough to alarm the stoutest sinner. 17. God has chosen the poor of this world, to be rich in faith, and heirs of his kingdom. 18.

The word for "poor" is here <span class="accented">dal</span>, "feeble" (see on vers. 1 and 4). It is a beautiful thought that by showing mercy and pity we are, as it were, making God our debtor; and the truth is wonderfully advanced by Christ, who pronounces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>), "Inasmuch as ye have done it mite one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (see on Proverbs 11:24; 28:27). St. Chrysostom ('Hom.,' 15, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>), "To the more imperfect this is what we may say, Give of what you have unto the needy. Increase your substance. For, saith he, 'He that giveth unto the poor lendeth unto God.' But if you are in a hurry, and wait not for the time of retribution, think of those who lend money to men; for not even these desire to get their interest immediately; but they are anxious that the principal should remain a good long while in the hands of the borrower, provided only the repayment be secure, and they have no mistrust of the borrower. Let this be done, then, in the present case also. Leave them with God, that he may pay thee thy wages manifold. Seek not to have the whole here; for if you recover it all here, how will you receive it back there? And it is on this account that God stores them up there, inasmuch as this present life is full of decay. But he gives even here also; for, 'Seek ye,' saith he, 'the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you.' Well, then, let us look towards that kingdom, and not be in a hurry for the repayment of the whole, lest we diminish our recompense. But let us wait for the fit season. For the interest in these cases is not of that kind, but is such as is meet to be given by God. This, then, having collected together in great abundance, so let us depart hence, that we may obtain beth the present and the future blessings" (Oxford transl.). <span class="cmt_word">That which he hath given will he pay him again;</span> <span class="accented">Vicissitudinem suam reddet ei</span>, Vulgate, "According to his gift will he recompense him." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">gemul</span>), "good deed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>, where it is rendered "recompense"). Ecclus. 32(35):10, etc., "Give unto the Most High according as he hath enriched thee; and as thou hast gotten give with a cheerful eye. For the Lord recompenseth, and will give thee seven times as much." There are proverbs rife in other lands to the same effect. The Turk says, "What you give in charity in this world you take with you after death. Do good, and throw it into the sea if the fish does not know it, God does." And the Russian, "Throw bread and salt behind you, you get them before you" (Lane).  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>11 The discretion of a man maketh him long-suffering,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it is a glory for him to be forbearing toward transgression.<p>The Syr., Targum, Aquila, and Theodotion translate &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; &#1488;&#1508;&#1493; by &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, and thus read &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;; but Rashi, Kimchi, and others remark that &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; is here only another vocalization for &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498;, which is impossible. The Venet. also translates: &#x39d;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; the correct word would be &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;: the discretion (intellectus or intelligentia; vid., regarding &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-4.htm">Proverbs 3:4</a>) of a man extends his anger, i.e., brings it about that it continues long before it breaks out (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a>). One does not stumble at the perf. in view of <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-7.htm">Proverbs 19:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-8.htm">Proverbs 18:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a>, and the like; in the proverbial style the fut. or the particip. is more common. In the synonymous parallel member, &#1514;&#1508;&#1488;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; points to man as such: it is an honour to him to pass by a transgression (particularly that which affects himself), to let it go aside, i.e., to forbear revenge or punishment (cf.
