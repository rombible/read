In cold weather to keep it warm, and at other times, as unwilling to use it in labour; it is the proper posture and just attitude of a slothful man. The word for "bosom" is sometimes used for a "pot" or "platter" (u); and then the sense is, that he puts his hands under a pot over a fire to warm them; or in one removed at some distance from the fire, as Jarchi; or rather it may signify his putting his hand into a plate of food, and yet so slothful, as it follows, <p>and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again; so sluggish, that he will rather starve than be at the pains to feed himself; he will not take his hand out of his bosom, to take food out of the dish to feed himself with; and even when his hand is in the dish, he will not take it from thence again, and lift it to his mouth; an hyperbolical expression. Gussetius (w) thinks, it may have respect to such slothful men, who are careless and negligent to their souls; who, though they have the holy Scriptures in their hands, like a vessel full of wholesome food for the soul, yet will not make use of the least mite out of them, that they may receive eternal life. <p>(u) "in patinam", Tigurine version; "in lebete", Mercerus, Michaelis; "in patinia", Cocceius; "in paropsidem", Schultens.

At an Oriental meal the guests sit round a table, on which is placed a dish containing the food, from which every one helps himself with his fingers, knives, spoons, and forks being never used (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-14.htm">Ruth 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-23.htm">Matthew 26:23</a>).

An Arabic proverb says, "He dies of hunger under the date tree."

Though a son show obstinacy, and manifest a bad disposition, yet there is hope in the training of the youth of being able to break his self-will, and to wean him from his bad disposition; therefore his education should be carried forward with rigorous exactness, but in such a way that wisdom and love regulate the measure and limits of correction: ad eum interficiendum animam ne tollas (animum ne inducas). &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; is not the subject, for in that case the word would have been &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-10.htm">2 Kings 14:10</a>). It is the object: To raise the soul to something is equivalent to, to direct his desire to it, to take delight in it. The teacher should not seek correction as the object, but only as the means; he who has a desire after it, to put the child to death in the case of his guilt, changes correction into revenge, permits himself to be driven by passion from the proper end of correction, and to be pushed beyond its limits. The lxx translates freely &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, for &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; is unrestrained abuse, &#1502;&#1493;&#1505;&#1512; &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497; as Immanuel glosses. Besides, all the ancients and also the Venet. translate &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; as the inf. of &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;. But Oetinger (for he translates: lift not thy soul to his cry, for which Euchel: let not his complaining move thy compassion) follows the derivation from &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; suggested by Kimchi, Meri, and Immanuel, and preferred by Ralbag, so that &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; after the from &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1514; is equivalent to &#1492;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;. But leaving out of view that &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; means strepere, not lamentari, and that &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; means attention, not desire, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13</a> points out to us a better interpretation.</body></html>
