A discreet and virtuous wife is more valuable than house and riches. 15. A sluggish, slothful disposition makes men poor; it brings them to want. And this applies both to the present life and that which is to come. 16. If we keep God's word, God's word will keep us from every thing really hurtful. We abuse the doctrine of free grace, if we think that it does away the necessity and advantage of obedience. Those that live at random must die. This truth is clearly taught in words enough to alarm the stoutest sinner. 17. God has chosen the poor of this world, to be rich in faith, and heirs of his kingdom. 18. When parents keep under foolish tenderness, they do their best to render children a comfort to them, and happy in themselves.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Casteth into a deep sleep - Better, causeth deep sleep to fall. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. a deep sleep&#8212;a state of utter indifference.<p>idle soul&#8212;or, "person" (compare Pr 10:4; 12:24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/proverbs/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Casteth into a deep sleep; </span> maketh a man careless and, negligent, and like one asleep in his business, whereby he cometh to want, as it follows. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep,.... Slothful persons are generally sleepy, and are very desirous of sleep, and indulge themselves in it; they spend their time, day and night, in sleep and drowsiness; and are quite careless and unconcerned about either their temporal or eternal good; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9</a>; <p>and an idle soul shall suffer hunger; and perish with it, both in a temporal and spiritual sense: an idle person, that will not work, ought not to eat; and an idle soul, or one that is unconcerned about his soul, and the spiritual food of it, shall perish for want of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Slothfulness casteth into</span> <span class="cmt_word">a deep sleep;</span> "causes deep sleep to fall upon a man" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a>).
