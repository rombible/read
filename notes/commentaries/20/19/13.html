Such are the contentions of a peevish, ill natured, and brawling wife, who is always scolding; and which is a continual vexation to a man, and renders him very uneasy in life: such a continual dropping was Xantippe to Socrates, who teased him night and day with her brawls and contentions (r).

The flat roofs of Eastern houses, formed of planks loosely joined and covered with a coating of clay or plaster, were always subject to leakage in heavy rains. The irritating altercations and bickering of a cross-grained wife are compared to the continuous drip of water through an imperfectly constructed roof. <span class="accented">Tecta jugiter perstillantia</span>, as the Vulgate has it. The Scotch say, "A leaky house and a scolding wife are two bad companions." The two clauses of the verse are coordinate, expressing two facts that render home life miserable and unendurable, viz. the misbehaviour of a son and the ill temper of a wife. The Septuagint, following a different reading, has, "Nor are offerings from a harlot's hire pure," which is an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">Deuteronomy 23:18</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>7ab. We thus first confine our attention to these two lines - <p>All the brethren of the poor hate him;<p>How much more do his friends withdraw themselves from him?<p>Regarding &#1488;&#1507; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, quanto magis, vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-7.htm">Proverbs 17:7</a>. In a similar connection <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-20.htm">Proverbs 14:20</a> spake of hatred, i.e., the cooling of love, and the manifesting of this coldness. The brethren who thus show themselves here, unlike the friend who has become a brother, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>, are brothers-german, including kindred by blood relation. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; has Mercha, and is thus without the Makkeph, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-10.htm">Psalm 35:10</a> (vid., the Masora in Baer's Liber Psalmorum, 1861, p. 133). Kimchi (Michlol 205a), Norzi, and others think that ca&#772;l (with &#1511;&#1502;&#1509; &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;) is to be read as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-12.htm">Isaiah 40:12</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493; is a verb. But that is incorrect. The case is the same as with &#1488;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-12.htm">Proverbs 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-2.htm">Psalm 60:2</a>. As here e&#780; with Mercha remains, so o&#780; with Mercha in that twice occurring &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;; that which is exceptional is this, that the accentuated &#1499;&#1500; is written thus twice, not as the usual &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, but as &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; with the Makkeph. The ground of the exception lies, as with other peculiarities, in the special character of metrical accentuation; the Mercha represents the place of the Makkeph, and a&#772; thus remains in the unchanged force of a Kametz-Chatuph. The plur. &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; does not stamp &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; as the defectively written plur.; the suffix e&#772;hu is always sing., and the sing. is thus, like &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;, 6b, meant collectively, or better: generally (in the sense of kind), which is the linguistic usage of these two words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>. But it is worthy of notice that the Masoretic form here is not &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, but m&#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, with Sheva. The Masora adds to it the remark &#1500;&#1497;&#1514;, and accordingly the word is thus written with Sheva by Kimchi (Michlol 202a and Lex. under the word &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;), in Codd., and older editions. The Venet., translating by &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;, has not noticed that. But how? Does the punctuation &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493; mean that the word is here to be derived from &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, maleficus? Thus understood, it does not harmonize with the line of thought. From this it is much more seen that the punctuation of the inflected &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, amicus, fluctuates. This word &#1502;&#1512;&#1506; is a formation so difficult of comprehension, that one might almost, with Olshausen, 210; Bttcher, 794; and Lagarde, regard the &#1502; as the partitive &#1502;&#1503;, like the French des amis (cf. Eurip. Med. 560: &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), or: something of friend, a piece of friend, while Ewald and others regard it as possible that &#1502;&#1512;&#1506; is abbreviated from &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;. The punctuation, since it treats the Tsere in &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;, 4b<p>(Note: In vol. i. p. 266, we have acknowledged &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;, from &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;, friend, only for <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-7.htm">Proverbs 19:7</a>, but at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-4.htm">Proverbs 19:4</a> we have also found amicus ejus more probable than ab amico suo ( equals  &#1502;&#1503; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;).) and elsewhere, as unchangeable, and here in &#1502;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493; as changeable, affords proof that in it also the manner of the formation of the word was incomprehensible.<p>Seeking after words which are vain.<p>7c. If now this line belongs to this proverb, then &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1507; must be used of the poor, and &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, or &#1500;&#1493;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; (vid., regarding the 15 Kers, &#1500;&#1468;&#1493; for &#1500;&#1488;, at <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>), must be the attributively nearer designation of the &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. The meaning of the Ker&#305;&#770; would be: he (the poor man) hunts after mere words, which - but no actions corresponding to them - are for a portion to him. This is doubtful, for the principal matter, that which is not a portion to him, remains unexpressed, and the &#1500;&#1493;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; eht  [to him they belong] affords only the service of guarding one against understanding by the &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; the proper words of the poor. This service is not in the same way afforded by &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; they are not; but this expression characterizes the words as vain, so that it is to be interpreted according to such parallels as <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a> : words which are not, i.e., which have nothing in reality corresponding to them, verba nihili, i.e., the empty assurances and promises of his brethren and friends (Fl.). The old translators all<p>(Note: Lagarde erroneously calls Theodotion's &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; a translation of the Ker&#305;&#770;; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; is, however, &#1500;&#1488;, and instead of &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; the expression &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, which is the translation of &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, is also found.)<p>read &#1500;&#1488;, and the Syr. and Targ. translate not badly: &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497; &#1500;&#1488; &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1512;; Symmachus, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;. The expression is not to be rejected: &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; sometimes means to come to &#1500;&#1488;, i.e., to nothing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-21.htm">Job 6:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-32.htm">Ezekiel 21:32</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-6.htm">Isaiah 15:6</a>; and &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, he is not  equals  has no reality, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-12.htm">Jeremiah 5:12</a>, &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, may thus mean words which are nothing (vain). But how can it be said of the poor whom everything forsakes, that one dismisses him with words behind which there is nothing, and now also that he pursues such words? The former supposes always a sympathy, though it be a feigned one, which is excluded by &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; [they hate him] and &#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468; [withdraw themselves]; and the latter, spoken of the poor, would be unnatural, for his purposed endeavour goes not out after empty talk, but after real assistance. So 7c: pursuing after words which (are) nothing, although in itself not falling under critical suspicion, yet only of necessity is connected with this proverb regarding the poor. The lxx, however, has not merely one, but even four lines, and thus two proverbs following 7b. The former of these distichs is: &#x395;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;; it is translated from the Hebr. (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-2.htm">Proverbs 5:2</a>  equals  &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;), but it has a meaning complete in itself, and thus has nothing to do with the fragment 7c. The second distich is: &#x39f;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;. This &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; is, without doubt, a translation of &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1507; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (7c); &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; is probably a corruption of &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; (thus the Complut.), not, he who pursueth words, but he who incites by words, as Homer (Il. iv. 5f.) uses the expression &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;. The concluding words, &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, are a repetition of the Heb. &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1502;&#1500;&#1496; (cf. lxx 19:5 with 28:26), perhaps only a conjectural emendation of the unintelligible &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;. Thus we have before us in that &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;, &#x3ba;.&#x3c4;.&#x3bb;., the line lost from the Heb. text; but it is difficult to restore it to the Heb. We have attempted it, vol. i, p. 15. Supposing that the lxx had before them &#1500;&#1488; &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, then the proverb is - <p>"He that hath many friends is rewarded with evil,<p>Hunting after words which are nothing;"<p>i.e., since this his courting the friendship of as many as possible is a hunting after words which have nothing after them and come to nothing. </body></html>
