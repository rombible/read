The certainty of punishment in the case of transgressors is a truth often insisted on even by heathens. Examples will occur to all readers, from the old Greek oracle, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, to Horace's "Raro antecedentem scelestum," etc. (See on Proverbs 20:30, where, however, the punishment is of human infliction.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>23 The fear of Jahve tendeth to life;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Satisfied, one spendeth the night, not visited by evil.<p>The first line is a variation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>. How the fear of God thus reacheth to life, i.e., helps to a life that is enduring, free from care and happy, 23b says: the promises are fulfilled to the God-fearing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-15.htm">Deuteronomy 11:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>; he does not go hungry to bed, and needs fear no awakening in terror out of his soft slumber (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-24.htm">Proverbs 3:24</a>). With &#1493; explic., 23a is explained. &#1500;&#1497;&#1503; &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506; means to spend the night (the long night) hungry. as &#1500;&#1497;&#1503; &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-7.htm">Job 24:7</a>, to pass the night in nakedness (cold). &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;&#1491;, of visitation of punishment, we read also at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>, and instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;, as it might be according to this passage, we have here the accus. of the manner placing the meaning of the Niph. beyond a doubt (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>, &#1512;&#1506;, in an evil manner). All is in harmony with the matter, and is good Heb.; on the contrary, Hitzig's ingenuity introduces, instead of &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;, an unheard of word, &#1493;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1506;, "and he stretches himself." One of the Greeks excellently translates: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;. The lxx, which instead of &#1512;&#1506;, &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, translates thus, &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;, discredits itself. The Midrash - Lagarde says of its translation - varies in colour like an opal. In other words, it handles the text like wax, and forms it according to its own taste, like the Midrash with its "read not so, but so." </body></html>
