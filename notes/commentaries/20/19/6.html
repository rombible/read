Men run into troubles by their own folly, and then fret at the appointments of God. 4. Here we may see how strong is men's love of money. 5. Those that tell lies in discourse, are in a fair way to be guilty of bearing false-witness. 6. We are without excuse if we do not love God with all our hearts. His gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are fruits of his bounty. 7. Christ was left by all his disciples; but the Father was with him. It encourages our faith that he had so large an experience of the sorrows of poverty. 8. Those only love their souls aright that get true wisdom. 9. Lying is a damning, destroying sin. 10. A man that has not wisdom and grace, has no right or title to true joy.

Aben Ezra and Gersom interpret the many of great and honourable men, who are courtiers to kings and princes; who wait upon them, ask favours of them, and seek for places under them. The Targum is, <p>"there are many that minister before a prince;'' <p>he has many servants, and some of them nobles; <p>and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts; or "to a man of gift" (k): who has it in his power to give, and has a heart to it; who is both a rich man and a liberal man; who is both able and willing to communicate to the necessities of others: such a man not only has the poor his friends, but others will speak well of him, and will make application to him on account of the poor; and, for the sake of doing good to them, will court his friendship and acquaintance. Bayne interprets this "man of gift" of Christ, who ascended on high, and received gifts for men, and gives them to men. <p>(k)  "viro doni", Montanus, Vatablus, Michaelis. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">prince</span>] It is better to preserve the parallelism, and to render the Heb. word in its primary sense of princely disposition, <span class="bld">the liberal man</span>, R.V. text, than with A.V. and R.V. marg., of princely rank.

But will a German poet use in one line "itzt" [same as jetzt  equals  now], and in the next "jetzt"? and could the Hebrew poet prefer to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; its rarer, and her especially not altogether unambiguous form &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (cf. to the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>)? We write &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, because the Masora comprehends this passage, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-19.htm">2 Samuel 14:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>, as the &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; '&#1490;, i.e., as the three, where one ought to expect &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, and is thus exposed to the danger of falling into error in writing and reading; but erroneously &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; is found in all these three places in the Masora magna of the Venetian Bible of 1526; elsewhere the Masora has the defectiva scriptio with like meaning only in those two other passages. While &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, or properly &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, with equal possibility of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;,<p>(Note: One sees from this interchange how softly the &#1497; was uttered; cf. Wellhausen's Text der B. Samuel (1871) (Preface). Kimchi remarks that we say &#1488;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500; for &#1488;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;, because we would otherwise confound it with &#1497;&#1511;&#1496;&#1500;.)<p>and it makes no material difference in the meaning of 24a whether we explain: there are friends who serve to bring one to loss: or a man of many friends comes to loss, - the inf. with &#1500; is used in substantival clauses as the expression of the most manifold relations, Gesen. 132, Anm. 1((cf. at <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-17.htm">Habakkuk 1:17</a>), here in both cases it denotes the end, as e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/92-8.htm">Psalm 92:8</a>, to which it hastens with many friends, or with the man of many friends. It is true that &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (like &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;) is almost always connected only with genitives of things; but as one says &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;: a man belongs to God, so may one also say &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;: a man belongs to many friends; the common language of the people may thus have named a man, to whom, because he has no definite and decided character, the rule that one knows a man by his friends is not applicable, a so-called every-man's-friend, or all-the-world's-friend. Theodotion translates &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;; and thus also the Syr., Targ., and Jerome render (and among the moderns, Hitzig) &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1506;&#1506; as reflexive in the sense of to cherish social intercourse; but this reflexive is &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-24.htm">Proverbs 22:24</a>. That &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1506; is either Hithpa. of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;, to exult, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-10.htm">Psalm 60:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/65-14.htm">Psalm 65:14</a>, according to which the Venet. translates (contrary to Kimchi) &#x3c9;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;: such an one can exult, but which is not true, since, according to 24b, a true friend outweighs the many; or it is Hithpa. of &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;, to be wicked, sinful (Fl.: sibi perniciem paraturus est); or, which we prefer, warranted by <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19</a>, of &#1512;&#1506;&#1506;, to become brittle (Bttcher and others) - which not only gives a good sense, but also a similar alliteration with &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-29.htm">Proverbs 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>. In contradistinction to &#1512;&#1506;, which is a general, and, according to the usage of the language (e.g., 17b), a familiar idea, the true friend is called, in the antithetical parallel member, &#1488;&#1492;&#1489; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>); and after <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>, &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511; &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;, one who remains true in misfortune. To have such an one is better than to have many of the so-called friends; and, as appears from the contrast, to him who is so fortunate as to have one such friend, there comes a blessing and safety. Immanuel has given the right explanation: "A man who sets himself to gain many friends comes finally to be a loser (&#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1493; &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;), for he squanders his means, and is impoverished in favour of others." And Schultens: At est amicus agglutinatus prae fratre. Rarum et carum esse genus insinuatur, ac proinde intimam illam amicitiam, quae conglutinet compingatque corda, non per multos spargendam, sed circumspecte et ferme cum uno tantum ineundam. Thus closes this group of proverbs with the praise of friendship deepened into spiritual brotherhood, as the preceding, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19</a>, with a warning against the destruction of such a relation by a breach of trust not to be made good again. </body></html>
