His gifts to us are past number, and all the gifts of men to us are fruits of his bounty. 7. Christ was left by all his disciples; but the Father was with him. It encourages our faith that he had so large an experience of the sorrows of poverty. 8. Those only love their souls aright that get true wisdom. 9. Lying is a damning, destroying sin. 10.

"Wisdom" is, in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">leb.</span> "heart;" it is a matter, not of intellect only. but of will and affections (see on Proverbs 15:32). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "loveth himself." The contrary, "hateth his own soul," occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-24.htm">Proverbs 29:24</a>. By striving to obtain wisdom a man shows that he has regard for the welfare of his soul and body. Hence St. Thomas Aquinas ('Sum. Theol.,' 1:2, qu. 25, art. 7, quoted by Corn. a Lapide) takes occasion to demonstrate that only good men are really lovers of themselves, while evil men are practically self-haters, proving his position by a reference to Arislotle's numeration of the characteristics of friendship, which the former exhibit, and none of which the latter can possess ('Eth. Nic.,' 9:4). <span class="cmt_word">He that keepeth understanding shall find</span> <span class="cmt_word">good</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>). A man must not only strive hard and use all available means to get wisdom and prudence, he must guard them like a precious treasure, not lose them for want of care or let them lie useless; and then he will find that they bring with themselves innumerable benefits. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>2 The not-knowing of the soul is also not good,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And he who hasteneth with the legs after it goeth astray.<p>Fleischer renders &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; as the subj. and &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; as neut. pred.: in and of itself sensual desire is not good, but yet more so if it is without foresight and reflection. With this explanation the words must be otherwise accentuated. Hitzig, in conformity with the accentuation, before us: if desire is without reflection, it is also without success. But where &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; denotes desire or sensuality, it is always shown by the connection, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-2.htm">Proverbs 23:2</a>; here &#1491;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;, referring to the soul as knowing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-14.htm">Psalm 139:14</a>), excludes this meaning. But &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is certainly gen. subjecti; Luzzatto's "self-knowledge" is untenable, for this would require &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;; Meri rightly glosses &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; by &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1500;. After this Zckler puts Hitzig's translation right in the following manner: where there is no consideration of the soul, there is no prosperity. But that also is incorrect, for it would require &#1488;&#1497;&#1503;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; is always pred., not a substantival clause. Thus the proverb states that &#1489;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is not good, and that is equivalent to &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; (for the subject to &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489; is frequently, as e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-26.htm">Proverbs 17:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-5.htm">Proverbs 18:5</a>, an infinitive); or also: &#1489;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; is a virtual noun in the sense of the not-knowing of the soul; for to say &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514; was syntactically inadmissible, but the expression is &#1489;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;, not &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1491;&#1506;&#1514; (&#1489;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;), because this is used in the sense unintentionally or unexpectedly. The &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; which begins the proverb is difficult. If we lay the principal accent in the translation given above on "not good," then the placing of &#1490;&#1501; first is a hyperbaton similar to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-26.htm">Proverbs 17:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11</a>; cf. &#1488;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-11.htm">Proverbs 17:11</a>; &#1512;&#1511;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-10.htm">Proverbs 13:10</a>, as if the words were: if the soul is without knowledge, then also (eo ipso) it is destitute of anything good. But if we lay the principal accent on the "also," then the meaning of the poet is, that ignorance of the soul is, like many other things, not good; or (which we prefer without on that account maintaining<p>(Note: The old interpreters and also the best Jewish interpreters mar the understanding and interpretation of the text, on the one side, by distinguishing between a nearest and a deeper meaning of Scripture (&#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492; and &#1491;&#1512;&#1498; &#1504;&#1505;&#1514;&#1512;); on the other by this, that they suppose an inward connection of all the proverbs, and expend useless ingenuity in searching after the connection. The former is the method especially adopted by Immanuel and Meri, the latter has most of all been used by Arama.)<p>the original connection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-1.htm">Proverbs 19:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-2.htm">Proverbs 19:2</a>), that as on the one side the pride of wisdom, so on the other ignorance is not good. In this case &#1490;&#1501; belongs more to the subject than to the predicate, but in reality to the whole sentence at the beginning of which it stands. To hasten with the legs (&#1488;&#1509;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-20.htm">Proverbs 28:20</a>) means now in this connection to set the body in violent agitation, without direction and guidance proceeding from the knowledge possessed by the soul. He who thus hastens after it without being intellectually or morally clear as to the goal and the way, makes a false step, goes astray, fails (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-36.htm">Proverbs 8:36</a>, where &#1495;&#1496;&#1488;&#1497; is the contrast to &#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;). </body></html>
