The spared and spoiled child is likely to become a man of great wrath. 20. Those that would be wise in their latter end, must be taught and ruled when young. 21. What should we desire, but that all our purposes may agree with God's holy will? 22. It is far better to have a heart to do good, and want ability for it, than to have ability for it, and want a heart to it. 23. Those that live in the fear of God, shall get safety, satisfaction, and true and complete happiness. 24. Indolence, when indulged, so grows upon people, that they have no heart to do the most needful things for themselves. 25. A gentle rebuke goes farthest with a man of understanding. 26.

"Godliness", of which the fear of the Lord is a principal part, has "the promise of this life and that to come", <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>, the fear of God is the beginning of a spiritual life; and it leads to eternal life, as Gersom observes, and is connected with it; <p>and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; with his lot and portion in this life; with the good things of it he has, being content therewith and "godliness with contentment is great gain", <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-6.htm">1 Timothy 6:6</a>, such a man has enough; he has all things in a spiritual sense; he is full of the blessings of goodness; he is blessed with all spiritual blessings; his mouth is satisfied, and his mind is filled with good things; and so he rests and abides night after night, and day after day; <p>he shall not be visited with evil; nothing shall hurt him; all his afflictions, his worst things, his evil ones: work together for his good; and they shall never separate from the love of God, nor anything that befalls him in this life, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-10.htm">Psalm 91:10</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fear of the Lord tendeth to life</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>). True religion, obedience to God's commandments, was, under a temporal dispensation, rewarded by a long and happy life in this world, an adumbration of the blessedness that awaits the righteous in the world to come. <span class="cmt_word">And he that hath it shall abide satisfied.</span> The subject passes from "the fear" to its possessor. Perhaps better, <span class="accented">and satisfied he shall pass the night</span>, which is the usual sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lun</span>), the verb here translated "abide" (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-31.htm">Proverbs 15:31</a>). God will satisfy the good man's hunger, so that he lays him down in peace and takes his rest (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-3.htm">Proverbs 10:3</a>). Vulgate<span class="accented">, In plenitudine commorabitur</span>, "He shall dwell in abundance." <span class="cmt_word">He shall not be visited with evil,</span> according to the, promises (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-15.htm">Deuteronomy 11:15</a>, etc.). Under our present dispensation Christians expect not immunity from care and trouble, but have hope of protection and grace sufficient for the occasion, and conducive to edification and advance in holiness. The LXX. translates thus: "The fear of the Lord is unto life for a man; but he that is without fear (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) shall sojourn in places where knowledge is not seen;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall go from bad to worse, till he ends in society where Divine knowledge is wholly absent, and lives without God in the world. The Greek interpreters read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">dea</span>), "knowledge," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">ra</span>), "evil." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These verses we take together. But we have no other reason for making a pause at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>, than that <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-22.htm">Proverbs 19:22</a> is analogous to <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>, and thus presents itself to us as an initial verse.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a><p>17 He lendeth to Jahve who is compassionate to the lowly,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his bounty He requites to him.<p>As at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>, &#1495;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; is part. Kal. The Masoretically exact form of the word is &#1495;&#1493;&#1504;&#1503; (as &#1493;&#1488;&#1493;&#1494;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-14.htm">Proverbs 20:14</a>) with Mercha on the first syllable, on which the tone is thrown back, and the &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1492; on the second. The Roman legal phrase, mutui datione contrahitur obligatio, serves to explain the fundamental conception of &#1500;&#1493;&#1492;, mutuo accipere, and &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;, mutuum dare (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>). The construction, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>, "to make any one bound as a debtor, obligare," lies at the foundation of the genitive connection '&#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492; &#1492; (not &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;). With 17b cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>, where the subject of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; (Ker&#305;&#770;) remains in the background. &#1490;&#1502;&#1500;&#1493; (not &#1490;&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;) is here his work done in the sense of good exhibited. "Love," Hedinger once said, "is an imperishable capital, which always bears interest." And the Archbishop Walther: nam Deo dat qui dat inopibus, ipse Deus est in pauperibus. Dr. Jonas, as Dchsel relates, once gave to a poor man, and said, "Who knows when God restores it!" There Luther interposed: "As if God had not long ago given it beforehand!" This answer of Luther meets the abuse of this beautiful proverb by the covetous.</body></html>
