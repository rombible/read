Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward?

The extreme tendency of men, and especially young men, to sins of impurity is no doubt, as Delitzsch remarks, the reason why this subject is again resumed. The subject is gradually worked up to the preceding admonitions in vers. 20-23, pointing out that the way of life, the way of safety, is to be secured by obedience to the precepts of parents, whose commandment and law illumine the perilous road of life, and whose reproofs are salutary to the soul. The arguments against the sin of adultery are cogent in their dissuasiveness, and none stronger of a purely temporal nature could be devised. It may be objected that the sin is not put forward in the higher light, as an offence before God. and that the appeal is made simply on the lines of self-interest; but who will deny that the scope of the teaching is distinctly moral, or that mankind is not influenced and dissuaded from sin by such a category of evils as includes personal beggary, dishonour, and death? <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - The first part of this verse is couched in almost the same terms as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>, except that <span class="accented">mitz'rath</span>, "precept," <span class="accented">preceptum</span>, is here used instead of <span class="accented">musar, eruditio</span>, or "disciplinary instruction," while the latter part of the two verses are identical. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this verse is continued the description of the subject, only once returning to the particip. The clauses are arranged independently, but logically according to the complex conception of the subject. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514; .tce are just the knaveries, i.e., the malicious wickedness which comes to light in word and deportment as &#1506;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; &#1508;&#1492;.

The phrase &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495; &#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (as <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a>), to let loose disputes, so that they break forth, reminds us rather of the unfettering of the winds by Aeolus than of the casting in of the apple of discord. Instead of &#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; the Ker&#305;&#770; has &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; on the other hand, &#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; remains uncorrected <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-19.htm">Proverbs 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>.

The forms &#1502;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; and &#1502;&#1491;&#1503; are also recognised: the former stands alone without any analogous example; the latter is compared at least with &#1502;&#1510;&#1491;, Arab. masa&#770;d (Psalmen, p. 163, 3).
