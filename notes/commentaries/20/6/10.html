The ants are more diligent than slothful men. We may learn wisdom from the meanest insects, and be shamed by them. Habits of indolence and indulgence grow upon people. Thus life runs to waste; and poverty, though at first at a distance, gradually draws near, like a traveller; and when it arrives, is like an armed man, too strong to be resisted. All this may be applied to the concerns of our souls. How many love their sleep of sin, and their dreams of worldly happiness! Shall we not seek to awaken such? Shall we not give diligence to secure our own salvation?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words express the wonder with which the Hebrew observer looked on the phenomena of insect life.

Or, "little sleeps, little slumbers" (s). These are the words of the sluggard, in answer to the call of him to awake and arise, desiring he might not be disturbed, but be suffered to sleep on longer: there is a very beautiful climax or gradation in the words, aptly expressing the disposition and actions of a sluggard; he first desires a "few sleeps" more, some sound sleeps one after another; which is quite agreeable to his character: and if he cannot be allowed them, then he requests a "few slumbers" at least, some dozings, till he can get himself thoroughly awake; and if these cannot be granted, yet he prays however that this might be admitted, <p>a little folding of the hands to sleep; or, "to lie down" (t); a few tossings and tumblings upon the bed more, with his hands folded about his breast; a sleeping gesture, and the posture of sluggards. The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, "a little thou wilt embrace the breast with the hands"; and the Syriac version, "and a little thou wilt put thine hand upon thy breast". The Jewish commentators understand this as a direction and command to sleep and slumber but little, since a little sleep is sufficient for nature; or otherwise poverty will come, &amp;c. but the former sense is best. <p>(s)    "parvis somnis, parvis dormitationibus", Pagninus; "pauculis somnis, pauculis dormitationibus", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator.

The Vulgate favours the latter view, "Thou shalt sleep a little, thou shalt slumber a little, thou shalt fold thy hands to sleep, and then," etc. Habits, as Aristotle in his 'Ethics' has shown, are the resultant of repeated acts, and habits entail consequences. So here the inspired teacher would have it learnt, from the example of the sluggard, that the self-indulgence which he craves leads on to a confirmed indolence, which in the end leaves him powerless. "Yet a little" is the phrase on the lips of every one who makes but a feeble resistance, and yields supinely to his darling vice. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The new commencement needs no particle denoting a conclusion; the &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488;, making the summons emphatic (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-10.htm">2 Kings 10:10</a>, frequently in interrogative clauses), connects it closely enough. &#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, neut., refers to what follows. The &#1493; before &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500; is explanatory, as we say in familiar language: Be so good as tell me, or do me the favour to come with me; while no Frenchman would say, Faites-moi le (ce) plaisir et venez avec moi (Fl.).<p>(Note: For the right succession of the accents here (three serviles before the Pazer), vid., Torath Emeth, p. 30; Accentuationssystem, xii. 4. According to Gen-Naphtali, Mercha is to be given to the &#1494;&#1488;&#1514;.)<p>The clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1488;&#1514;<p>(Note: The Zinnorith before the Mahpach in these words represents at the same time the Makkeph and rejects the Zinnorith; vid., Torath Emeth, p. 16, and my Psalmencomm. Bd. ii.((1860), p. 460, note 2.)<p>is not to be translated: in case thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour; for this is represented (<a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2</a>) as having already in fact happened. On two sides the surety is no longer sui juris: the creditor has him in his hand; for if the debtor does not pay, he holds the surety, and in this way many an honourable man has lost house and goods, Sirach 29:18, cf. 8:13; - and the debtor has him, the surety, in his hand; for the performance which is due, for which the suretyship avails, depends on his conscientiousness. The latter is here meant: thou hast made thy freedom and thy possessions dependent on the will of thy neighbour for whom thou art the surety. The clause introduced with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; gives the reason for the call to set himself free (&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500; from &#1504;&#1510;&#1500;, R. &#1510;&#1500;, &#1513;&#1500;, to draw out or off); it is a parenthetical sentence. The meaning of &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1508;&#1468;&#1505; is certain. The verb &#1512;&#1508;&#1505; (&#1512;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474;, &#1512;&#1508;&#1505;) signifies to stamp on, calcare, conclucare; the Kams<p>(Note: el-Feyroozbdee's Kmus, a native Arabic Lexicon; vid., Lane's Arab. Lex. Bk. i. pt. 1, p. xvii.)<p>explains rafas by rakad balarjal. The Hithpa. might, it is true, mean to conduct oneself in a trampling manner, to tread roughly, as &#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, and the medial Niph. &#1504;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;, to conduct oneself speaking (in an impassioned manner); but <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-31.htm">Psalm 68:31</a> and the analogy of &#1492;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1505; favour the meaning to throw oneself in a stamping manner, i.e., violently, to the ground, to trample upon oneself - i.e., let oneself be trampled upon, to place oneself in the attitude of most earnest humble prayer. Thus the Graec. Venet. &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;, Rashi ("humble thyself like to the threshold which is trampled and trode upon"), Aben-Ezra, Immanuel ("humble thyself under the soles of his feet"); so Cocceius, J. H. Michaelis, and others: conculcandum te praebe. &#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;&#1489; is more controverted. The Talmudic-Midrash explanation (b. Joma, 87a; Bathra, 173b, and elsewhere): take with thee in great numbers thy friends (&#1512;&#1492;&#1489;  equals  &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;), is discredited by this, that it has along with it the explanation of &#1492;&#1514;&#1512;&#1508;&#1505; by (&#1497;&#1491;) &#1508;&#1468;&#1505; &#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1512;, solve palmam (manus), i.e., pay what thou canst. Also with the meaning to rule (Parchon, Immanuel), which &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; besides has not, nothing is to be done. The right meaning of &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468; is to rush upon one boisterously, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a>. &#1512;&#1492;&#1489; means in general to be violently excited (Arab. rahiba, to be afraid), and thus to meet one, here with the accusative: assail impetuously thy neighbour (viz., that he fulfil his engagement). Accordingly, with a choice of words more or less suitable, the lxx translates by &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;, Symm., Theodotion by &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the Graec. Venet. by &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the Syr. (which the Targumist copies) by &#1490;&#1512;&#1490; (solicita), and Kimchi glosses by: lay an arrest upon him with pacifying words. The Talmud explains &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498; as plur.;<p>(Note: There is here no distinction between the Kethb and the Ker&#305;&#770;. The Masora remarks, "This is the only passage in the Book of Proverbs where the word is written with Yod (&#1497;);" it thus recognises only the undisputed &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1498;.)<p>but the plur., which was permissible in <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-28.htm">Proverbs 3:28</a>, is here wholly inadmissible: it is thus the plena scriptio for &#1512;&#1506;&#1498; with the retaining of the third radical of the ground-form of the root-word (&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;  equals  &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;), or with &#1497; as mater lectionis, to distinguish the pausal-form from that which is without the pause; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-34.htm">Proverbs 24:34</a>. lxx, Syr., Jerome, etc., rightly translate it in the sing. The immediateness lying in &#1500;&#1498; (cf. &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-24.htm">Matthew 5:24</a>) is now expressed as a duty, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-4.htm">Proverbs 6:4</a>. One must not sleep and slumber (an expression quite like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>), not give himself quietness and rest, till the other has released him from his bail by the performance of that for which he is surety. One must set himself free as a gazelle or as a bird, being caught, seeks to disentangle itself by calling forth all its strength and art.</body></html>
