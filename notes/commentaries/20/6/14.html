Observe how such a man is described. He says and does every thing artfully, and with design. His ruin shall come without warning, and without relief. Here is a list of things hateful to God. Those sins are in a special manner provoking to God, which are hurtful to the comfort of human life. These things which God hates, we must hate in ourselves; it is nothing to hate them in others. Let us shun all such practices, and watch and pray against them; and avoid, with marked disapproval, all who are guilty of them, whatever may be their rank.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A naughty person - literally, "a man of Belial," i. e., a worthless man (see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a> note).

The Targum is, "he casteth out strifes", as firebrands among men. The words in the Hebrew text are, "he sendeth out discord", or "strife" (a); these are the messengers sent out by him to make mischief. <p>(z) "contentiones", Pagninus, Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator, Mercerus, Gejerus; "jurgia", V.

In this respect we observe a striking correspondence with the method adopted by our Saviour in his leaching, who referred everything to the heart, as the true seat of all that was good or bad in man. <span class="cmt_word">Frowardness is in his heart</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">tah'pukoth b'libbo</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his heart is full of perverse imaginations, it is there he nourishes his jealousy, his hatred, his malice, his ill will. It is there, too, <span class="cmt_word">he deviseth mischief continually.</span> "Devising mischief" carries us one step further back in the history of evil. It is this feature, this deliberate premeditation to plot mischief and to devise means to carry it into execution, which makes the character of the man simply diabolical. He makes his heart as it were the workshop wherein he fabricates and prepares his villainy. The Hebrew <span class="accented">kharash</span> (to which the participle <span class="accented">khoresh</span> belongs) is equivalent to the Vulgate <span class="accented">machinari</span>, and the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to fabricate, devise, plot." (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-29.htm">Proverbs 3:29</a> and ver. 18; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-4.htm">Psalm 36:4</a>, "He deviseth mischief upon his bed.") The LXX. combines the two statements in one proposition: "A perverse heart deviseth evil at all  times." Similarly the Vulgate, which, however, joins "continually" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">b'koleth</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">omni tempore</span>) to the second hemistich, thus: "And at all times he sows discord (<span class="accented">et omni tempore jurgia seminat</span>)." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>He soweth discord</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">mid'-yanim</span> (Keri) <span class="accented">y'shalleakh</span>); literally, <span class="accented">he sends forth</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> excites) <span class="accented">strife</span>; or, as the margin, <span class="accented">he casteth forth strife.</span> The Keri reading <span class="accented">mid'yanim</span>, for the Khetib <span class="accented">m'danim</span>, is probably, as Hitzig suggests, derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>. The phrase occurs again as <span class="accented">shallakh m'danim</span> in ver. 19, and as <span class="accented">shillakh madon</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-28.htm">Proverbs 16:28</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>). This is the culminating point in the character of the wicked man. He takes delight in breaking up friendship and in destroying concord among brethren (see ver. 19), and thus destroys one of the most essential elements for promoting individual happiness and the welfare of the community at large. This idea of the community is introduced into the LXX., which reads, "Such an one brings disturbance to the city (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>)." The motive cause may be either malice or self-interest. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In this verse the change of the time cannot be occasioned by this, that &#1511;&#1497;&#1509; and &#1511;&#1510;&#1497;&#1512; are distinguished as the earlier and the later period of the year; for &#1511;&#1497;&#1509; ( equals  Arab. k&#803;ayt, from k&#803;a&#770;t, to be glowing hot, cf. Arab. kghyyt&#803; of the glow of the mid-day heat) is the late summer, when the heat rises to the highest degree; but the son of the Shunammite succumbed to the sun-stroke in the time of harvest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-18.htm">2 Kings 4:18</a>.). Lwenstein judiciously remarks that &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503; refers to immediate want, &#1488;&#1504;&#1512;&#1492; to that which is future; or, better, the former shows them engaged in persevering industry during the summer glow, the latter as at the end of the harvest, and engaged in the bringing home of the winter stores. The words of the procuring of food in summer are again used by Agur, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25</a>; and the Aramaic fable of the ant and the grasshopper,<p>(Note: Vid., Goldberg's Chofes Matmonim, Berlin 1845; and Landsberger's Berlin Graduation Thesis, Fabulae aliquot Aramaeae, 1846, p. 28.)<p>which is also found among those of Aesop and of Syntipas, serves as an illustration of this whole verse. The lxx has, after the "Go to the ant," a proverb of five lines, &#x3b7;&#787;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;. Hitzig regards it as of Greek origin; and certainly, as Lagarde has shown, it contains idiomatic Greek expressions which would not occur to a translator from the Hebrew. In any case, however, it is an interpolation which disfigures the Hebrew text by overlading it. </body></html>
