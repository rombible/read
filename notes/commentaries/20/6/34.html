Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward? May we closely watch every sense by which poison can enter our minds or affections.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The two forms of evil bring, each of them, their own penalty.

The first hemistich is adduced as a reason for what has preceded, while the concluding hemistich and the following and last verses are a deduction strengthening what has been stated before, and also showing that the punishment will be inevitable. The general <span class="accented">consensus</span> of commentators and texts is to connect the two hemistiches of this verse. Thus the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "For the wrath of her husband filled with jealousy shall not spare in the day of judgment;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quia zelus et furor viri non parcet in die vindictae</span>, "For the jealousy and rage of a man shall not spare in the day of vengeance;" the Syriac, <span class="accented">Nam</span> <span class="accented">quia furor mariti plenus est zelotypia non parcet in die retributionis</span>, "For because rage of a husband is full of jealousy he shall not spare in the day of retribution." So the Arabic, and the Tigarina Versio, and among the commentators Durandus. Dathe, Doderlein, Holden. But the Hebrew simply makes the statement, <span class="accented">ki-kimah khamath-gaver, quia zelus excandescentia viri, i.e.</span>, as in the Authorized Version, "for jealousy is the rage of a man," <span class="accented">ki</span>, equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, "for" and <span class="accented">kinah is</span> the subject of the sentence. The Hebrew <span class="accented">kinah</span> is "jealousy" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-4.htm">Proverbs 27:4</a>, "Who is able to stand before envy?" or, as margin, "jealousy." The ordinary copulative verb "is" is best understood as connecting the subject and the predicate; "the rage of a man," Hebrew <span class="accented">kamath-gaver</span>, as above, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the glow of a man's anger" (Delitzsch), or "a man's fierce anger" (Zockler). Jealousy awakens and inflames the wrath and anger of a man or husband to its highest pitch. It evokes the strongest feelings for revenge. <span class="accented">Man</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">gaver</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">ish</span>, "a man," in opposition to "a wife" - "a <span class="accented">husband</span>," as here. The word is chiefly found in poetry. Its derivation, from <span class="accented">gavar</span>, "to be strong," serves to bring out the idea also of the intensity or force of the jealousy - it burns or rages with all the might of the man. The latter part of the verse in the Hebrew is simply, "and he will not spare (<span class="accented">v'lo-yakh'mol</span>) in the day of vengeance." The Authorized Version "therefore" serves to bring out the deduction, though it does net occur in the original. <span class="accented">He will not spare</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the injured husband will not show any clemency or mercy to the adulterer, the man who has wronged him so deeply. <span class="accented">In the day of vengeance</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">b'yom nakam.</span> The expression may refer to the time when the adulterer is brought before the judges, but more probably to every occasion on which the husband can exercise his vengeance. So Gejerus. For the expression, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a>, "The day of the Lord's vengeance;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-28.htm">Job 20:28</a>, "The day of his wrath;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>, "The day of wrath." Jealousy is implacable (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6</a>, "Jealousy is cruel as the grave"). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A second example of destructive consequences naturally following a certain course is introduced with &#1488;&#1501; of the double question. &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (from &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;, after the form &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;, but for which &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; is used) is the regular modification of gah&#803;h&#803;al&#305;&#770;m (Gesen. 27, 2).
