Observe how such a man is described. He says and does every thing artfully, and with design. His ruin shall come without warning, and without relief. Here is a list of things hateful to God. Those sins are in a special manner provoking to God, which are hurtful to the comfort of human life. These things which God hates, we must hate in ourselves; it is nothing to hate them in others. Let us shun all such practices, and watch and pray against them; and avoid, with marked disapproval, all who are guilty of them, whatever may be their rank.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A new section, but not a new subject.

With the recognized Hebrew form of climax (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-18.htm">Proverbs 30:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-24.htm">Proverbs 30:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1-15</a>; 2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>), the teacher here enumerates six qualities as detestable, and the seventh as worse than all (seven represents completeness), but all the seven in this instance belong to one man, the man of Belial <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. proud look&#8212;literally, "eyes of loftiness" (Ps 131:1).

The same expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a> is rendered "thoughts of iniquity." (On <span class="accented">deviseth</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">khoresh</span>, see ver. 14 and ch. 3:29.) The thought is a repetition of ver. 14<span class="accented">a</span>. There are evil thoughts in all men's hearts; but the devising, fabricating of them, and thus making the heart into a devil's workshop, is the mark of utter depravity and wickedness, and is abhorrent to God. The devices of the heart, though planned in secret, are clear to him "to whom all hearts are open, all desires known, and from whom no secrets are bid." The peculiar position which the heart occupies in the enumeration is to be accounted for on the ground that it is the fountain, not only of those vices which have been already mentioned, but of those which follow. The fifth thing is <span class="cmt_word">feet that be swift in running to mischief.</span> Again we are reminded of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-7.htm">Isaiah 59:7</a>, "Their feet run to evil." "Mischief" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ra</span>) is a re-echo of ver. 14 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-16.htm">Proverbs 1:16</a>. "To run to mischief" is to carry out with alacrity and without delay what has already been devised in the heart. It implies more than falling or sliding into sin, which is common to all. It denotes, Cornelius a Lapide remarks, "inexplebilem sceleris aviditatem, et destinatum studium." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There follows now a third brief series of instructions, which run to a conclusion with a deterring prospect similar to the foregoing.<p>12 A worthless man, a wicked man,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is he who practiseth falsehood with his mouth;<p>13 Who winketh with his eyes, scrapeth with his foot,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pointeth with his fingers.<p>14 Malice is in his heart,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He deviseth evil at all times,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spreadeth strife.<p>15 Therefore suddenly his destruction shall come,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly shall he be destroyed, and there is no remedy.<p>It is a question, what is the subject and what the predicate in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12</a>. Thus much is clear, that upon him who is here described according to his deceitful conduct the sentence of condemnation shall fall. He who is so described is thus subject, and &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; is without doubt predicate. But does the complex subject begin with &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;? Thus e.g., Hitzig: "A worthless man is the wicked man who...." But the interchange of &#1506;&#1491;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is a sign of parallel relation; and if 12b belonged attributively to &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, then since &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; is not used, it ought at least to have been continued by &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498;. The general moral categories, 12a, are thus predicates, as was indeed besides probable; the copious division of the subject demands also in point of style a more developed predicate. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-27.htm">Proverbs 16:27</a> is simpler in plan, and also logically different. There the expression is, as is usual, &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1500;. Since &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; is not possible, the author uses instead &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1500;. This word, composed of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; and &#1497;&#1506;&#1500; (from &#1497;&#1506;&#1500;, &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;, to be useful, to be good for), so fully serves as one word, that it even takes the article, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>. It denotes worthlessness, generally in a chain of words in the genitive, but also the worthless, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-18.htm">Job 34:18</a>; and it is to be so taken here, for &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; does not form a constructivus, and never governs a genitive. &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1500; is thus a virtual adjective (as nequam in homo nequam); the connection is like that of &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-7.htm">Proverbs 11:7</a>, and elsewhere, although more appositional than this pure attributive. Synonymous with &#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1506;&#1500; is &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (from an, to breathe), wickedness, i.e., want of all moral character. Thus worthless and wicked is he who practises deceit with his mouth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-24.htm">Proverbs 4:24</a>), i.e., who makes language the means of untruthfulness and uncharitableness. &#1506;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; is meant in a moral sense, but without excluding that distortion of the mouth which belongs to the mimicry of the malicious. It is the accus. of the object; for &#1492;&#1500;&#1498; is also bound in a moral sense with the accusative of that which one practises, i.e., dealing with, exercises himself in, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-7.htm">Proverbs 2:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-18.htm">Proverbs 28:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>.</body></html>
