We are stewards of our worldly substance, and have to answer to the Lord for our disposal of it; to waste it in rash schemes, or such plans as may entangle us in difficulties and temptations, is wrong. A man ought never to be surety for more than he is able and willing to pay, and can afford to pay, without wronging his family; he ought to look upon every sum he is engaged for, as his own debt. If we must take all this care to get our debts to men forgiven, much more to obtain forgiveness with God. Humble thyself to him, make sure of Christ as thy Friend, to plead for thee; pray earnestly that thy sins may be pardoned, and that thou mayest be kept from going down to the pit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Better, "Do this now, O my son, and free thyself when thou hast come into thy friend's house; go, how thyself down (perhaps "stamp with thy foot," or "hasten"), press hotly upon thy friend.

Take the following advice, as the best that can be given in such circumstances, in order to be freed from such an obligation, or to be safe and easy under it; <p>when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; or, <p>"because or seeing thou art fallen into the hand of thy friend,'' <p>as the Targum; or <p>"though thou art,'' &amp;c. <p>as Aben Ezra; which may be understood either of the creditor to whom a man is bound, or of the debtor for whom he is bound, or of both; for a surety is in the hands or power of both: he is in the hands of the creditor, who may demand payment of the debt of him; and he is in the hands of the debtor, who, if a careless or crafty and deceitful man, may leave him to the payment of it. The Septuagint and Arabic versions are, <p>"for thou art come into the hands of evil men for thy friend;'' <p>and the Syriac version, <p>"seeing for thy friend thou art fallen into the hands of thine enemy;'' <p>and therefore must make the best of it thou canst, and in the following way: <p>go, humble thyself; that is, to the creditor, prostrate thyself before him; lie down upon the ground to be trodden on, as the word (d) signifies; fall down on thine knees, and entreat him to discharge thee from the bond, or give longer time for payment, if up; for thou art in his hands, and there is no carrying it with a high hand or a haughty spirit to him; humility, and not haughtiness, is most likely to be serviceable in such a case; <p>and make sure thy friend; for whom thou art become a surety, as the Syriac and Arabic versions add; solicit him, as the former of these versions render it; stimulate him, as the Septuagint; stir him up, urge him to pay off the debt quickly, and discharge the bond, or give thee security and indemnity from it. Or, "magnify thy friend" (e); that is, to the creditor; speak of him as a very able and responsible man, and as an honest and faithful one, that will pay in due time. Some render it "magnify", and speak well of the debtor to thy friend, which may please and appease him: or, "multiply thy friends" (f); get as many as thou canst to intercede for thee, and get thee discharged from the obligation by some means or another; to this purpose Jarchi. <p>(d) "praebe conculcandum te", Montanus, Vatablus, Michaelis. (e)  "evehe proximum tuum", Tigurine version; "magnifica", so some in Vatablus.

The surety is to take immediate steps to be set free. The urgency of the advice is to be explained by the serious consequences which would follow in the event of the debtor not satisfying the creditor in due time. The surety became liable to the penalties inflicted by the Hebrew law of debt. His property could be distrained. His bed and his garment could be taken from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-27.htm">Proverbs 22:27</a> and Proverbs 20:16), and he was liable as well as his family to be reduced to the condition of servitude. So we find the son of Sirach saying, "Suretyship hath undone many of good estate, and shaken them as a wave of the sea: mighty men hath it driven from their houses, so that they wandered among strange nations" (Ecclus. 29:18; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3-5</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25</a>). Compare the dictum of Thales, the Greek philosopher, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "Give surety, and ruin is near;" and that of Chilo (Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 6:32), "Sponsioni non deest jactura" - "Loss is not wanting to a surety." The same idea is conveyed in the modern German proverb, "Burgen soll man wurgen" - "Worry a surety" <span class="cmt_word">Do this now;</span> or, <span class="accented">therefore.</span> The particle <span class="accented">epho</span> is intensive, and emphasizes the command, and in this sense is of frequent occurrence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-32.htm">Genesis 27:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-10.htm">2 Kings 10:10</a>, etc.). It appears to be equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">quod dico.</span> So the Vulgate, "Do therefore what I say;" similarly the LXX. renders, "Do, my son, what I bid thee (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." It carries with it the sense of instant and prompt action. <span class="cmt_word">And deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> set thyself free when thou findest thou art actually at the mercy of thy friend for whom thou hast become surety. The <span class="accented">ki</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) is not hypothetical, but actual; it is not "if" you are, but "when" or because you actually are in his power. The Vulgate and LXX. render <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> respectively by <span class="accented">quia</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Go, humble thyself;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> present thyself as a suppliant, prostrate thyself, offer thyself to be trodden upon (Michaelis), or humble thyself like to the threshold which is trampled and trode upon (Rashi). or humble thyself under the soles of his feet (Aben Ezra). The expression implies the spirit of entire submission, in which the surety is to approach his friend in order to be released from his responsibility. The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">hith'rappes</span> has, however, been rendered differently. Radically <span class="accented">raphas</span> signifies "to tread or trample with the feet," and this has been taken to express haste, or the bestirring of one's self. So the Vulgate reads <span class="accented">festina</span>, "hasten;" and the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "be not remiss." But the hithp, clearly determines in favour of the reflexive rendering; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>, "Till every one submit himself with pieces of silver" - the only other passage where <span class="accented">raphas</span> occurs. <span class="cmt_word">And make sure thy friend</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">r'hav reeyka</span>); rather, <span class="accented">importune thy friend</span>, be urgent with him, press upon him to fulfil his engagement. The verb <span class="accented">rahav</span> is properly "to be fierce," "to rage," and hence with the accusative, as here, "to assail with impetuosity." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a> it is used with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">b</span>), and signifies to act fiercely against any one. The meaning of the passage is that if abject submission or persuasion does not avail, then sterner measures are to be resorted to to gain the desired end. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The answer to the Why? in this verse is: no reasonable cause - only beastly sensuality, only flagitious blindness can mislead thee. The &#1489; of &#1489;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; is, as 19b and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>, that of the object through which one is betrayed into intoxication. &#1495;&#1511; (thus, according to the Masora, four times in the O.T. for &#1495;&#1497;&#1511;) properly means an incision or deepening, as Arab. hujr (from hjr, cohibere), the front of the body, the part between the arms or the female breasts, thus the bosom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a> (with the swelling part of the clothing, sinus vestis, which the Arabs call jayb), and the lap; &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511; (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-8.htm">Proverbs 4:8</a>), to embrace, corresponds here more closely with the former of these meanings; also elsewhere the wife of any one is called &#1488;&#1513;&#1514; &#1495;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493; or &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489;&#1514; &#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;, as she who rests on his breast. The ancients, also J. H. Michaelis, interpret <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15-20</a> allegorically, but without thereby removing sensual traces from the elevated N.T. consciousness of pollution, striving against all that is fleshly; for the castum cum Sapientia conjugium would still be always represented under the figure of husband and wife dwelling together. Besides, though &#1494;&#1512;&#1492; might be, as the contrast of &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, the personified lust of the world and of the flesh, yet 19a is certainly not the &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, but a woman composed of flesh and blood. Thus the poet means the married life, not in a figurative sense, but in its reality - he designedly describes it thus attractively and purely, because it bears in itself the preservative against promiscuous fleshly lust. </body></html>
