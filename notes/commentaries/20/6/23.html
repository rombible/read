The servant of God may often feel much perplexity as to his duty, darkness may seem to have settled down upon his path. But there is always some “commandment,” or positive order, about which he can have no doubt, calling for his immediate obedience; there is always some “law,” or rather “instruction” in God’s Word offering itself as his guide; there are always some “reproofs of discipline,” that is, he knows he has certain things to shun, others to follow, for the purpose of self-discipline. It is by following out these parts of his duty that he does know, which are, as it were, a “light shining in a dark place “(<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>), that man prepares himself for more light and clearer vision; then God “opens his eyes” that he may “behold wondrous things out of His law” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-18.htm" title="Open you my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.">Psalm 119:18</a>); because he has some knowledge of God’s will and desire to do it, more is given unto him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm" title="For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that he has.">Matthew 13:12</a>), and his path becomes continually clearer, shining “more and more unto the perfect day” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-18.htm" title="But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more to the perfect day.">Proverbs 4:18</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:20-35 The word of God has something to say to us upon all occasions. Let not faithful reproofs ever make us uneasy. When we consider how much this sin abounds, how heinous adultery is in its own nature, of what evil consequence it is, and how certainly it destroys the spiritual life in the soul, we shall not wonder that the cautions against it are so often repeated. Let us notice the subjects of this chapter. Let us remember Him who willingly became our Surety, when we were strangers and enemies. And shall Christians, who have such prospects, motives, and examples, be slothful and careless? Shall we neglect what is pleasing to God, and what he will graciously reward?

The "law" is the whole law of God in its entirety; not here the Law of Moses technically, but the whole system of generalized instruction; They stand, therefore, in the same relation to each other as "a lamp" and "light," the one being particular, and the other general. "Light" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">or</span>) is light in general, as the light of the day and the sun, while "a lamp" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ner</span>, from <span class="accented">nur</span>, "to shine) is a particular light like that of a candle, which is enkindled at some other source. The "commandment" and the "law" alike enlighten the conscience and enable one to walk in his way of life. On this passage Le Clerc remarks, "Ut in tenebris lucerna, aut fax ostendit nobis, qua eundam sit: in ignorantiae humanae caligine, quae nos per hanc totam vitam cingit, revelatio divina nos docet, quid sit faciendum, quid vitandum." So the psalmist says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a>, "The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;" and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, "Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they direct and show the true way of faith and life (Gejerus). The "commandment" and the "law" may stand for the whole revelation of God without reference to any particular precept (as Scott), but they have here a specific bearing on a particular form of human conduct, as appears from the following verses. <span class="cmt_word">And reproofs of instruction are the way of life.</span> <span class="accented">Reproofs of instruction</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">tok'khoth musar</span>, disciplinary reproofs, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> reproofs whose object is the discipline of the soul and the moral elevation of the character. The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; thus connecting it with education in its highest sense. Such reproofs are a way of life (Hebrew, <span class="accented">derek khayyim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> they lead to life; they conduce to the prolongation of life. This view of the subject, so prominent in the mind of the teacher in other passages (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a> and 19), must not be lost sight of, though the words are susceptible of another interpretation, as indicating that the severest reproofs, inasmuch as they correct errors and require obedience, conduce to the greatest happiness (Patrick). Or again, it may mean that disciplinary reproofs are necessary to life. The soul to arrive at perfection must undergo them as part of the conditions of its existence, and, consequently, they are to be submitted to with the consciousness that, however irksome they may be, they are imposed for its eventual benefit (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>). But this interpretation is unlikely from what follows. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>What now follows is not a separate section (Hitzig), but the corroborative continuation of that which precedes. The last word (&#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, strife) before the threatening of punishment, 14b, is also here the last. The thought that no vice is a greater abomination to God than the (in fact satanical) striving to set men at variance who love one another, clothes itself in the form of the numerical proverb which we have already considered, pp. 12, 13. From that place we transfer the translation of this example of a Midda: - <p>16 There are six things which Jahve hateth,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And seven are an abhorrence to His soul:<p>17 Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hands that shed innocent blood;<p>18 An heart that deviseth the thoughts of evil,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feet that hastily run to wickedness,<p>19 One that uttereth lies as a false witness,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he who soweth strife between brethren.<p>The sense is not, that the six things are hateful to God, and the seventh an abomination to Him besides (Lwenstein); the Midda-form in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3-2:6</a>, and in the proverb in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a>, shows that the seven are to be numbered separately, and the seventh is the non plus ultra of all that is hated by God. We are not to translate: sex haecce odit, for &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, (&#1492;&#1501;, &#1492;&#1503;) points backwards and hitherwards, but not, as &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, forwards to that immediately following; in that case the words would be &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, or more correctly &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;. But also Hitzig's explanation, "These six things (viz., <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12-15</a>) Jahve hateth," is impossible; for (which is also against that haecce) the substantive pronoun &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; nuonorp , &#1492;&#1504;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, &#1492;&#1492;&#1504;&#1492;) is never, like the Chald. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;), employed as an accus. in the sense of &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1501;, &#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1503;, it is always (except where it is the virtual gen. connected with a preposition) only the nom., whether of the subject or of the predicate; and where it is the nom. of the predicate, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-15.htm">Deuteronomy 20:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-19.htm">Isaiah 51:19</a>, substantival clauses precede in which &#1492;&#1504;&#1492; (&#1492;&#1502;&#1492;) represents the substantive verb, or, more correctly, in which the logical copula resulting from the connection of the clause itself remains unexpressed. Accordingly, '&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488; &#1492; is a relative clause, and is therefore so accentuated here, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15</a> and elsewhere: sex (sunt) ea quae Deus odit, et septem (sunt) abominatio animae ejus. Regarding the statement that the soul of God hates anything, vid., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a>. &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, an error in the writing occasioned by the numeral (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-25.htm">Proverbs 26:25</a>), is properly corrected by the Ker&#305;&#770;; the poet had certainly the singular in view, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-32.htm">Proverbs 3:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>, when he wrote &#1514;&#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1514;. The first three characteristics are related to each other as mental, verbal, actual, denoted by the members of the body by means of which these characteristics come to light. The virtues are taken all together as a body (organism), and meekness is its head. Therefore there stands above all, as the sin of sins, the mentis elatae tumor, which expresses itself in elatum (grande) supercilium: &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the feature of the &#1512;&#1501;, haughty (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-28.htm">Psalm 18:28</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-28.htm">2 Samuel 22:28</a>), is the opposite of the feature of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1495; &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-29.htm">Job 22:29</a>; &#1506;&#1497;&#1503; is in the O.T. almost always (vid., Sol 4:9) fem., and adjectives of course form no dual. The second of these characteristics is the lying tongue, and the third the murderous hands. &#1491;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1504;&#1511;&#1497; is innocent blood as distinguished from &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1511;&#1497;, the blood of the innocent, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-13.htm">Deuteronomy 19:13</a>.<p>(Note: The writing &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; follows the Masoretic rule, vid., Kimchi, Michlol 205b, and Heidenheim under <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-10.htm">Deuteronomy 19:10</a>, where in printed editions of the text (also in Norzi's) the irregular form &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1504;&#1511;&#1497; is found. Besides, the Metheg is to be given to &#1491;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;, so that one may not read it dom, as e.g., &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>, that one may not read it &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;.)</body></html>
