This character of a malicious mischief-maker would seem to be especially hateful to God; it is described in like terms in Psalms 64 and a similar fate foretold of it; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-19.htm" title="A false witness that speaks lies, and he that sows discord among brothers.">Proverbs 6:19</a> also it is held up as the very worst of the seven detestable things there mentioned.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:12-19 If the slothful are to be condemned, who do nothing, much more those that do all the ill they can. Observe how such a man is described. He says and does every thing artfully, and with design. His ruin shall come without warning, and without relief. Here is a list of things hateful to God. Those sins are in a special manner provoking to God, which are hurtful to the comfort of human life. These things which God hates, we must hate in ourselves; it is nothing to hate them in others. Let us shun all such practices, and watch and pray against them; and avoid, with marked disapproval, all who are guilty of them, whatever may be their rank.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The duper and the dupe shall share the same calamity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

The idea seems to be taken from the shattered fragments of a potter's vessel, which it is impossible to reunite. So in the case of the man whose life has been one of fraud, deceit, and malice, there is for him no hope of any recovery. The language may seem exaggerated, but the picture is painted with this high colouring to exhibit a strong deterrent to such a line of conduct, and further, it may be remarked that, in the present day, only the most confiding would again put trust in a man who has wilfully and maliciously deceived them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>). The second hemistich of this verse occurs again <span class="accented">verbatim</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After the poet has admonished the sluggard to take the ant as an example, he seeks also to rouse him out of his sleepiness and indolence:<p>9 How long, O sluggard, wilt thou lie?<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When wilt thou rise up from thy sleep?<p>10 "A little sleep, a little slumber,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A little folding of the hands to rest!"<p>11 So comes like a strong robber thy poverty,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy want as an armed man.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9-10</a><p>The awakening cry, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9</a>, is not of the kind that Paul could have it in his mind, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>. &#1506;&#1510;&#1500; has, as the vocative, Pasek after it, and is, on account of the Pasek, in correct editions accentuated not with Munach, but Mercha. The words, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>, are not an ironical call (sleep only yet a little while, but in truth a long while), but per mimesin the reply of the sluggard with which he turns away the unwelcome disturber. The plurals with &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; sound like self-delusion: yet a little, but a sufficient! To fold the hands, i.e., to cross them over the breast, or put them into the bosom, denotes also, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5</a>, the idler. &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1511;, complicatio (cf. in Livy, compressis quod aiunt manibus sidere; and Lucan, 2:292, compressas tenuisse manus), for formed like &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-8.htm">Proverbs 3:8</a>, and the inf. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1489; like &#1495;&#1505;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-21.htm">Proverbs 10:21</a>, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-19.htm">Proverbs 16:19</a>. The perf. consec. connects itself with the words heard from the mouth of the sluggard, which are as a hypothetical antecedent thereto: if thou so sayest, and always again sayest, then this is the consequence, that suddenly and inevitably poverty and want come upon thee. That &#1502;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498; denotes the grassator, i.e., vagabond (Arab. dawwar, one who wanders much about), or the robber or foe (like the Arab.
