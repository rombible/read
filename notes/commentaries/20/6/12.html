Here, however, the word “Belial” is in apposition with “man,” “a man (who is) worthless, a good-for-nothing fellow.” The word appears to have been personified by the later Jews, and is used in the form Belial, or Beliar, to denote Satan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>, where see note in this Series).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">walketh</span>] The R.V., following the Heb. pointing, is more abrupt and forcible:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A worthless person, a man of iniquity;</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He walketh with a froward mouth.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thirteenth Address.

Warning against mischievousness as a thing hateful to God.</span> The connection of this with the preceding discourse is not at first sight very clear, but it may be found in the fact, attested only too unhappily by experience, that sloth leads those who indulge in it to such vices as are next enumerated. The sluggard may develop into a treacherous and deceitful man, and even if such should not happen, the characteristics of the two are nearly allied, and their end is much the same. St. Paul, in his First Epistle to Timothy, observes this same combination of character, and remarks that idlers are "tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>). The intention of the discourse is obviously to dissuade all, and especially the young, from the vices, and to preserve them from the ruin, of those men of whom "the naughty person and wicked man" is the type. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</span> The teacher begins by stating in general terms the nature and character of the man whom he now holds up as a warning to others, and then proceeds to point out the various features in his conduct and behaviour by which he may be known. In concise terms he is described as "a naughty person, a wicked man." This is pre-eminently his character, and the first feature in it is that his life is one of wilful and injurious misreprescntation of the truth. <span class="accented">A naughty person, a wicked man.</span> In apposition and mutually explanatory. The grammatical arrangement of the sentences which follow, each of which is introduced by a participle, and is thus coordinate to the ethers, as well as the parallel terms, "person" (<span class="accented">adam</span>) and "man" (<span class="accented">ish</span>), determine this apposition. So Bertheau and Delitzsch. Others (as Zockler, Noyes, Kamph), however, connect the second expression with the series of characteristics which follow, and render, "A worthless person is a deceiver, who," etc., but wrongly. <span class="accented">A naughty person</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">adam b'liyyaal</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a man of Belial</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">homo apostata</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. The word "Belial" is derived from <span class="accented">b'li</span>, "without," and <span class="accented">yaal</span>, "profit" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "without profit"), or from <span class="accented">b'li</span> and <span class="accented">ol</span>, "yoke" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "without yoke"), and strictly signifies either a worthless or a lawless person. The latter derivation is, however, rejected by Gesenius and others. Its abstract signification is worthlessness, uselessness; its concrete or adjectival, worthless. The word "naughty" (Anglo-Saxon, <span class="accented">naht, ne aht</span>, "not anything," equivalent to "nothing"), in the sense of good-for-nothing, ne'er-do-well, adopted in the Authorized Version, exactly reproduces its strict etymological meaning. The word, however, always carries with it the idea of moral turpitude. In the present instance its meaning is determined by the appositional phrase, "a man of iniquity," or "a wicked man," and such iniquity as takes the form of mischief making, deceit, and sowing discord among brethren. The "man of Belial" is not therefore simply, as its etymological derivation would imply, a worthless individual, one who is of no use either to himself or to the community at large, but a positively wicked, iniquitous, and despicable character. The meaning of the word varies in other passages. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>, where it first occurs, it is used to designate those who have fallen sway into idolatry, and induce others to follow their example. In this sense it corresponds with the Vulgate, <span class="accented">apostata, as</span> signifying a defection from the worship of the true God. Again, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-16.htm">1 Samuel 1:16</a> it is applied to the profanation of sacred places. When Hannah is accused by Eli of drunkenness in God's house at Shiloh, she replies, "Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial." In the historical books (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Judges, 1 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Chronicles), where it is of frequent occurrence, it has the general meaning of "wickedness," under whatever form it appears. So in the Psalms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-4.htm">Psalm 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-8.htm">Psalm 41:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-3.htm">Psalm 101:3</a>) and Nahum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-11.htm">Nahum 1:11, 15</a>). In the Book of Job (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-18.htm">Job 34:18</a>, once only) it is used adjectively and as a term of reproach, "Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked [<span class="accented">b'liyyaal</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'worthless']?" Individuals possessing the qualities of worthlessness, profanity, or wickedness are designated in Holy Scripture either as "sons," "children," "daughters," or "men of Belial." The word only occurs in two other passages in the Proverbs - <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-27.htm">Proverbs 16:27</a> and Proverbs 19:28. In the New Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-15.htm">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>) the word "Belial" (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span>) appears as an appellative of Satan, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, "the evil one," as the representative of all that is bad, and as antichrist. <span class="accented">A wicked man</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ish aven</span>); literally, <span class="accented">a man of vanity</span> or <span class="accented">iniquity</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">vir inutilis</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The radical idea of <span class="accented">aven</span> (from <span class="accented">un</span>, "nothing") is that of emptiness or vanity, and has much, therefore, in common with <span class="accented">b'liyaal.</span> Its secondary  meaning, and that which it usually bears in Scripture, is iniquity. "A man of iniquity" is one who is altogether deficient in moral consciousness, and who goes about to work wickedness and do hurt and injury to others (cf. ver. 18 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15</a>). <span class="accented">Walketh with a froward mouth.</span> His first characteristic, as already observed. His whole life and conduct are marked by craftiness, deceit, perversion, and misrepresentation, and an utter want of truth. "Walking" is here, as elsewhere in Scripture, used of some particular course of conduct. So we find the LXX. paraphrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>. "he enters or walks not in good ways." <span class="accented">With a froward mouth</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ik'shuth peh</span>); literally, <span class="accented">with perversity of mouth</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">ore perverse.</span> Symmachus has <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "with perversity of mouth." The mouth, or speech, is the vehicle by which this person gives outward expression to the evil thoughts which are inwardly filling his heart. The phrase occurs before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-24.htm">Proverbs 4:24</a>. The meaning of the passage is well illustrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-7.htm">Psalm 10:7</a>, "His mouth is full of misery, deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Elihu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-11.htm">Job 35:11</a>) says that God has set the beasts as our teachers, so he sends the sluggard to the school of the ant (Ameise), so named (in Germ.) from its industry (Emsigkeit):<p>6 Go to the ant, sluggard;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider her ways, and be wise!<p>7 She that hath no judge,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Director, and ruler:<p>8 She prepareth in summer her food,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Has gathered in harvest her store.<p>The Dech written mostly under the &#1500;&#1498; separates the inseparable. The thought, Go to the ant, sluggard! permits no other distinction than in the vocative; but the Dech of &#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1492; is changed into Munach<p>(Note: Cod. 1294 accentuates &#1500;&#1498; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1492;; and that, according to Ben-Asher's rule, is correct.)<p>on account of the nature of the Athnach-word, which consists of only two syllables without the counter-tone. The ant has for its Hebrew-Arabic name &#1504;&#1502;&#1500;&#1492;, from the R. &#1504;&#1501; (Isaiah, p. 687), which is first used of the sound, which expresses the idea of the low, dull, secret - thus of its active and yet unperceived motion; its Aramaic name in the Peshto, u&#770;menaa', and in the Targ. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1488; (also Arab. sumsum, simsim, of little red ants), designates it after its quick activity, its busy running hither and thither (vid., Fleischer in Levy's Chald. Wrterb. ii. 578). She is a model of unwearied and well-planned labour. From the plur. &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492; it is to be concluded that the author observed their art in gathering in and laying up in store, carrying burdens, building their houses, and the like (vid., the passages in the Talmud and Midrash in the Hamburg Real-Encyclopdie fr Bibel und Talmud, 1868, p. 83f.). To the ant the sluggard (&#1506;&#1510;&#1500;, Aram. and Arab. &#1506;&#1496;&#1500;, with the fundamental idea of weight and dulness) is sent, to learn from her to be ashamed, and to be taught wisdom.</body></html>
