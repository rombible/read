The same lesson was repeated by our Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-10.htm" title="But when you are bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher: then shall you have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with you.">Luke 14:10</a>, <span class= "ital">sqq., and </span>enforced on the ground of His own example.

But it is the honour of rulers to search out matters, to bring to light hidden works of darkness. 4,5. For a prince to suppress vice, and reform his people, is the best way to support his government. 6,7. Religion teaches us humility and self-denial. He who has seen the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus, will feel his own unworthiness. 8-10. To be hasty in beginning strife, will bring into difficulties. War must at length end, and might better be prevented. It is so in private quarrels; do all thou canst to settle the matter. 11,12. A word of counsel, or reproof, rightly spoken, is especially beautiful, as fine fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets. 13. See what ought to be the aim of him that is trusted with any business; to be faithful. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, should be thus acceptable to us. 14. He who pretends to have received or given that which he never had, is like the morning cloud, that disappoints those who look for rain. 15. Be patient to bear a present hurt. Be mild to speak without passion; for persuasive language is the most effectual to prevail over the hardened mind. 16. God has given us leave to use grateful things, but we are cautioned against excess.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The pushing, boastful temper is, in the long run, suicidal. It is wiser as well as nobler to take the lower place at first in humility, than to take it afterward with shame. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/14-8.htm">Luke 14:8-10</a>, which is one of the few instances in which our Lord's teaching was fashioned, as to its outward form, upon that of this book. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7.

It is much more to thine honour and credit to seat thyself in a place rather beneath than above thee; which being observed by some of the officers at court, or by him whose business it is to look after such things, he will beckon or call to thee to come up to a higher and more honourable place: <p>than that thou shouldest be put lower, in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen; than that thou shouldest be thrust away with a severe rebuke for thy boldness and arrogance, in approaching too near the king's person, and taking the place of some great man, which did not become thee, and be forced down to a lower place, to thy great mortification; and the more, as this will be in the presence of the prince thou hadst the curiosity of seeing, and the ambition of making thyself acceptable to, by a gay and splendid appearance; and now with great disgrace turned out of his presence, or at least driven to a great distance from him. Our Lord seems to refer to this passage, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-8.htm">Luke 14:8</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Come up hither</span>] Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/14-8.htm" title="When you are bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honorable man than you be bidden of him;...">Luke 14:8-10</a>, and Introd. p. 33.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whom thine eyes have seen</span>] This aggravates the disgrace: you have pressed presumptuously into the inner circle, so as to stand face to face with the prince, and there “in his presence” shalt thou be humiliated.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither.</span> It is better for the prince to select you for elevation to a high post; to call you up near his throne. The reference is not necessarily to position at a royal banquet, though the maxim lends itself readily to such application. This warbling against arrogance and presumption was used by our blessed Lord in enforcing a lesson of humility and self-discipline (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-7.htm">Luke 14:7</a>, etc ). Septuagint, "For it is better for thee that it should be said, Come up unto me (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span>)" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-7.htm">Luke 14:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</span> The last words have been variously interpreted:  "to whom thou hast come with a request for preferment;" "into whose august presence thou hast been admitted, so as to see his face" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-24.htm">2 Samuel 14:24</a>); "who knows all about thee, and will thus make thee feel thy humiliation all the more." But <span class="accented">nadib</span>, rendered "prince," is not the king, but any noble or great man; and what the maxim means is this - that it is wise to save yourself from the mortification of being turned out of a place which you have knowingly usurped. Your own eyes see that he is in the company; you are aware of what is his proper position; you have occupied a post which belongs to another; justly you are removed, and all present witness your humiliation. The moralist knew that the bad spirit of pride was fostered and encouraged by every act of self-assertion; hence the importance of his warning. The Septuagint makes a separate sentence of these last words, "Speak thou of what thine eyes saw," or, perhaps, like St. Jerome, the Syriac, and Symmachus, attach them to the next verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>1 These also are proverbs of Solomon,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Which the men of Hezekiah the king of Judah have collected.<p>Hezekiah, in his concern for the preservation of the national literature, is the Jewish Pisistratos, and the "men of Hezekiah" are like the collectors of the poems of Homer, who were employed by Pisistratos for that purpose. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; is the subject, and in Cod. 1294, and in the editions of Bomberg 1515, Hartmann 1595, Nissel, Jablonsky, Michaelis, has Dech.
