In whose house he has often been, and whom he has frequently visited; and, observing what was done there, not only discovers and tells abroad the secrets of his family, but even things which are false; yea, in a court of judicature, appears a witness against him, and swears falsely to his hurt and prejudice. Such a man <p>is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow; that is, to his neighbour, against whom he bears false witness; and, by so doing, he mauls his fame, his credit, character, and reputation; and, as with a sword, takes away his life; and against whom there is no more guarding than against a sharp arrow, that comes from afar, suddenly and swiftly. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/25.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">a maul</span>] “i.e. a hammer, a variation of mall, from <span class="ital">malleus</span> … The Hebrew and English alike occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-18.htm" title="A man that bears false witness against his neighbor is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.">Proverbs 25:18</a> only.

One who bears false witness against his neighbour prepares for him the instruments of death, such as those mentioned here. "A maul" (<span class="accented">mephits</span>), usually a heavy wooden hammer (compare <span class="accented">malleus</span> and "mallet"); here a club, or mace, used in battle, <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a>). There is a kind of climax in the three offensive weapons named - the club bruises, the sword inflicts wounds, the arrow pierces to the heart; and the three may represent the various baneful effects of false testimony, how it bruises reputation, spoils possessions, deprives of life. The second clause is from the Decalogue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Another proverb continues the commendation of the effective word; for it represents, in emblem, the interchangeable relation of speaker and hearer:<p>A golden earring and an ornament of fine gold - <p>A wise preacher to an ear that heareth;<p>i.e., as the former two ornaments form a beautiful ensemble, so the latter two, the wise preacher of morality and an attentive ear, form a harmonious whole: &#1506;&#1500;, down upon, is explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>. &#1504;&#1494;&#1501;, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-12.htm">Proverbs 11:12</a>, standing along with &#1489;&#1488;&#1507;, meant a ring for the nose; but here, as elsewhere, it means an earring (lxx, Jerome, Venet.), translated by the Syr. and Targ. by &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, because it serves as a talisman. A ring for the nose<p>(Note: Vid., Gieger's Zeitschrift, 1872, pp. 45-48, where it is endeavoured to be shown that &#1504;&#1494;&#1501;, as an earring, is rejected from the later biblical literature, because it had become "an object used in the worship of idols," and that the word was used only of a ring for the nose as a permissible ornament, while &#1506;&#1490;&#1497;&#1500; was used for the earring. But that does not apply to the Solomonic era; for that, in the passage under review, &#1504;&#1494;&#1501; signifies a ring for the nose, is only a supposition of Geiger's, because it accords with his construction of history.)<p>cannot also be here thought of, because this ornament is an emblem of the attentive ear: willingly accepted chastisement or instruction is an ear-ornament to him who hears (Stier). But the gift of the wise preacher, which consists in rightly dividing the word of truth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>, is as an ornament for the neck or the breast &#1495;&#1500;&#1497; ( equals  Arab. khaly, fem. &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;  equals  h&#803;ilyt), of fine gold (&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501;, jewel, then particularly precious gold, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501;, Arab. katam, recondere).<p>(Note: Hitzig compares Arab. kume&#770;t; but this means bayard, as Lagarde remarks, the Greek &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; and if by &#1499;&#1514;&#1501; gold foxes (gold money) are to be thought of, yet they have nothing whatever to do with bayards (red-brown horses); cf. Beohmer, de colorum nominibus equinorum, in his Roman. Stud.

This &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; is a philological mystery, the solution of which has been attempted by Bochart, Letronne, and Field.)<p>It looks well when two stand together, the one of whom has golden earrings, and the other wears a yet more precious golden necklace - such a beautiful mutual relationship is formed by a wise speaker and a hearer who listens to his admonitions. </body></html>
