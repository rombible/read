To his care we probably also owe the compilation of Books II. (Psalms 42-72) and III. (73-89) of the Psalter, in the former of which are included several psalms of David’s which had not found a place in Book I., though this last-named book consists almost, if not entirely, of psalms ascribed to him. In the same manner the present book (Proverbs 25-29) contains proverbs of Solomon which apparently were not known to the compiler of the previous collection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/proverbs/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-1.htm" title="These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.">Proverbs 25:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">These — </span>Which are contained in this and the following chapters; <span class="ital">are also the proverbs of Solomon — </span>Lessons on piety and virtue, sententiously delivered by Solomon, and collected out of his works by some of the servants of that good king, Hezekiah; who, setting himself with all his heart to reform the people of Judah, among other things which he did for that purpose, and wherein God blessed his endeavours, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-21.htm" title="And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.">2 Chronicles 31:21</a>,) caused these proverbs to be transcribed out of the ancient records, for their fuller instruction.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-3 God needs not search into any thing; nothing can be hid from him.

For a prince to suppress vice, and reform his people, is the best way to support his government. 6,7. Religion teaches us humility and self-denial. He who has seen the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus, will feel his own unworthiness. 8-10. To be hasty in beginning strife, will bring into difficulties. War must at length end, and might better be prevented. It is so in private quarrels; do all thou canst to settle the matter. 11,12. A word of counsel, or reproof, rightly spoken, is especially beautiful, as fine fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets. 13. See what ought to be the aim of him that is trusted with any business; to be faithful. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, should be thus acceptable to us. 14. He who pretends to have received or given that which he never had, is like the morning cloud, that disappoints those who look for rain. 15. Be patient to bear a present hurt. Be mild to speak without passion; for persuasive language is the most effectual to prevail over the hardened mind. 16.

Who these men were is not certain; perhaps his ministers of state, Eliakim, Sheban, and Joah; or the prophets of his time, Isaiah, Micah, and Hosea: the Targum and Syriac version call them his "friends". Whoever they were, no doubt they were employed by Hezekiah; and which is recorded to his honour, that he was so careful to preserve such useful sayings, and annex them to those that were already collected and put together as above.

Fourth Collection of Proverbs. Chaps. 25–29<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. The Title. See Introd., ch. iii. p. 24.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This Title is interesting as affording a proof that a revival of literary activity accompanied the revival of religion and of national prosperity which marked the reign of Hezekiah. Hezekiah himself was a poet of no mean order (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-9.htm" title="The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness:">Isaiah 38:9</a> ff.); and “the men of Hezekiah” were doubtless a body of scribes engaged under the direction of the king in literary labours. But beside this, this brief title is one of those “fragments of history,” which, as Professor Sayce has shown, “have been illuminated by the progress of oriental research,” and “the importance and true significance of which can now be realised for the first time.” This Title points, he thinks, to the existence of a royal library in Jerusalem, into which these proverbs, never before edited, were now gathered and “copied out,” and similar to the libraries which are now known to have existed in the cities of Babylonia and Assyria. “The vassalage of Judah to the king of Assyria in the reign of Ahaz had necessarily led to the introduction of Assyrian culture into Jerusalem. Ahaz himself had led the way. In the court of the palace he had erected a sundial, a copy of the gnomons which had been used for centuries in the civilised kingdoms of the Euphrates and the Tigris. But the erection of the sundial was not the only sign of Assyrian influence. The most striking feature of Assyrian and Babylonian culture was the libraries, where scribes were kept constantly employed, not only in writing and compiling new books, but in copying and re-editing older ones. The ‘men of Hezekiah’ who ‘copied out’ the proverbs of Solomon performed duties exactly similar to the royal scribes in Nineveh.” (<span class="ital">The Higher Criticism and the Verdict of the Monuments</span>, pp. 475, 476, 4th edition.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">copied out</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐξεγράψαντο</span>, LXX.; transtulerunt, Vulg.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 29.</span> - Part VI. SECOND GREAT COLLECTION OF SOLOMONIC PROVERBS, gathered by "the men of Hezekiah," in which wisdom is set forth as the greatest blessing to the king and his subjects. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">superscription: <span class="cmt_word"></span>These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah King of Judah copied out.</span> The word "also" implies that a previous collection was known to the compiler of the present book - probably the one which we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10.htm">Proverbs 10-22:16</a>, of which nine proverbs are inserted here. But there was still a large number of proverbial sayings attributed to Solomon, and preserved partly by oral tradition and partly in writing, which it was advisable to collect and secure before they were lost. The zeal of Hezekiah took this in hand. He was not, as far as we know, an author himself, but he evidently felt a warm interest in literature, and "the men of Hezekiah," not mentioned elsewhere, must have been his counsellors and scholars, to whom was entrusted the duty of gathering together into a volume the scattered sayings of the wise king. Among those contemporaries, doubtless, Isaiah was eminent, and it is not improbable that Shebna the scribe and Josh the chronicler were members of the learned fraternity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>). The verb rightly translated "copied out" (<span class="accented">athak</span>) means, properly, "to remove," "to transfer" from one place to another (<span class="accented">transtulerunt</span>, Vulgate); hence it signifies here to copy into a book words taken from other writings or people's mouths. The sayings thus collected, whether truly Solomon's or not, were extant under his name, and were regarded as worthy of his reputation for wisdom. The title is given in the Septuagint, thus: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>.

It has been translated "impossible to distinguish," equivalent to "miscellaneous;" "beyond doubt," equivalent to "genuine," "hard to interpret," as in Polyb., 15:12, 9. St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>) applies the term to wisdom, but the interpreters there are not agreed as to the meaning, it being rendered "without partiality," "without variance," "without doubtfulness," etc. It seems best to take the word as used by the LXX. to signify "mixed," or "miscellaneous." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The following proverb is connected as to its subject with the foregoing: one ought not to do evil to his neighbour without necessity; even evil which has been done to one must not be requited with evil:<p>Say not, "As he hath done to me, so I do to him:<p>I requite the man according to his conduct."<p>On the ground of public justice, the talio is certainly the nearest form of punishment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-19.htm">Leviticus 24:19</a>.; but even here the Sinaitic law does not remain in the retortion of the injury according to its external form (it is in a certain manner practicable only with regard to injury done to the person and to property), but places in its stead an atonement measured and limited after a higher point of view. On pure moral grounds, the jus talionis ("as thou to me, so I to thee") has certainly no validity. Here he to whom injustice is done ought to commit his case to God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-22.htm">Proverbs 20:22</a>, and to oppose to evil, not evil but good; he ought not to set himself up as a judge, nor to act as one standing on a war-footing with his neighbour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-11.htm">Judges 15:11</a>); but to take God as his example, who treats the sinner, if only he seeks it, not in the way of justice, but of grace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>.). The expression 29b reminds of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-12.htm">Proverbs 24:12</a>. Instead of &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, there is used here, where the speaker points to a definite person, the phrase &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;. Jerome, the Venet., and Luther translate: to each one, as if the word were vocalized thus, &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/62-13.htm">Psalm 62:13</a>). </body></html>
