Thus the Chaldee renders the first clause, <span class="ital">The north wind, </span><span class="greekheb">משׂנא</span>, <span class="ital">concipit, conceives, </span>or produces, <span class="ital">rain: </span>and the Seventy, <span class="greekheb">ανεμος βορεας εξεγειρει νεφη</span>, <span class="ital">the north wind raises clouds. </span>Undoubtedly the north wind brings clouds and rain in some climates, and if, as some assert, it generally does so in Judea, as according to Aristotle it does in those parts of Africa which border on the Mediterranean sea, this interpretation ought certainly to be preferred. Either of them, however, shows the odious disposition and character of backbiters; and that they ought to be discountenanced and frowned upon by all that love their fellow-creatures, and wish peace to be promoted among men.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:19. Confidence in an unfaithful man is painful and vexatious; when we put any stress on him, he not only fails, but makes us feel for it. 20. We take a wrong course if we think to relieve those in sorrow by endeavouring to make them merry. 21,22. The precept to love even our enemies is an Old Testament commandment. Our Saviour has shown his own great example in loving us when we were enemies. 23. Slanders would not be so readily spoken, if they were not readily heard. Sin, if it receives any check, becomes cowardly. 24. It is better to be alone, than to be joined to one who is a hinderance to the comfort of life. 25. Heaven is a country afar off; how refreshing is good news from thence, in the everlasting gospel, which signifies glad tidings, and in the witness of the Spirit with our spirits that we are God's children! 26. When the righteous are led into sin, it is as hurtful as if the public fountains were poisoned. 27. We must be, through grace, dead to the pleasures of sense, and also to the praises of men. 28. The man who has no command over his anger, is easily robbed of peace.

So the geographer (w) says, the swift north wind drives away the moist clouds; which usually come from the opposite quarter, the south. The word used has the signification of conceiving, and begetting, and bringing forth; hence some (x) render it to a different sense, and so the Targum, <p>"the north wind bringeth forth rain;'' <p>and in this sense Gersom interprets it, and says, <p>"the north wind produces rain in Jerusalem, because it brings there the vapours that ascend from the sea, which lies north unto it;'' <p>and the philosopher (y) says, that in the northern parts of the world the south wind produces rain; and in the southern parts the north wind produces it, as in Judea. But in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a>, fair, fine, golden, serene, "weather", is said to "come out of the north"; agreeably to which, the north wind is by Homer (z) called  the producer of serene weather; and by Virgil (a) "clarus aquilo", i.e. what makes serene. The Arabic version reads it, "the south wind"; and that does bring rain, and, as that version has it, excites the clouds. But the first reading and sense of the words seem best (b), and agree with what follows: <p>so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue; drives it away, discourages and silences it. When a man puts on a stern countenance, a frowning and angry look, on such who bring him slanderous reports and idle tales of their neighbours, and reproach and backbite them, it checks them, and puts a stop to their practices; whereas listening to them, and especially with an air of pleasure, encourages them in them; were there not so many that take pleasure in hearing those talebearers and backbiters, were they more roughly dealt with, as the blustering north wind does with the rain, there would not be so much of this evil practised. <p>(w) Dionysii Perieg. v. 532.

The rendering of A.V. text follows the Vulg., dissipat pluvias, and is apparently supported by <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-22.htm" title="Fair weather comes out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.">Job 37:22</a> : “Fair weather,” or “golden brightness, cometh out of the north,” a phenomenon which is there attributed to the action of the wind blowing from that quarter (see <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-21.htm" title="If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:">Proverbs 25:21</a></span> and note in this Series). But by “north” may perhaps here be meant “north-west.” (“Intelligendus ille ventus qui inter aquilonem et occasum flat, Thrascias sive Caurus, qui a Seneca in Hippol. 25:1130 <span class="ital">imbrifer</span> dicitur,” Rosenm.) The comparison thus becomes clear and forcible: <span class="bld">The north wind bringeth forth rain</span>. The secret action of the wind covers the heaven with clouds, <span class="bld">so doth</span> (adopting R.V. in preference to A.V.) <span class="bld">a backbiting tongue an angry countenance</span>; its secret malignity is sure to be discovered and to clothe the countenance of its victim with dark anger.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The north wind driveth away rain.</span> So St. Jerome (<span class="accented">Ventus</span> <span class="accented">Aquilo dissipat pluvias</span>), Symmachus, Aben Ezra, and others. The north wind is called by the natives of Palestine "the heavenly," from the bright effect which it produces in the sky. "By means of the north wind cometh he (the sun) forth as gold" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a>). But the verb here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) means "to bring forth, produce" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>); hence the Revised Version rightly renders, "The north wind bringeth forth rain." This is quite true if "north wind" be taken as equivalent to "wind from the dark quarter" (Umbreit), like <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in Greek; and, in fact, the northwest wind in Palestine does bring rain. Septuagint, "The north wind arouseth (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) clouds." <span class="cmt_word">So doth an angry countenance a backbiting, tongue.</span> Carrying on the interpretation intended by the Authorized Version, this clause means that an angry leer will check a slanderer and incline him to hold his peace from prudential motives. But with the rendering given above, "bringeth forth," another explanation is involved, viz. "So does a secret, slandering tongue cause a troubled countenance." When a man discovers that a secret slanderer is working against him, he shows it by his gloomy and angry look, as the sky is dark  with clouds when a storm is threatened. "Countenance" is plural in the Hebrew, denoting, as Hitzig points out, that the calumniator does not affect one person only, but occasions trouble far and wide, destroys friendly relations between many, excites suspicion and enmity in various quarters Septuagint, "An impudent countenance provokes the tongue." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This proverb is of a kindred character to the foregoing. "If thy comrade eats honey," says an Arabic proverb quoted by Hitzig, "do not lick it all up." But the emblem of honey is not continued in this verse:<p>Make rare thy foot in thy neighbour's house,<p>Lest he be satiated with thee, and hate thee.<p>To make one's foot rare or dear from a neighbour's house is equivalent to: to enter it seldom, and not too frequently; &#1492;&#1493;&#1511;&#1512; includes in itself the idea of keeping at a distance (Targ. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; &#1512;&#1490;&#1500;&#1498;; Symmachus, &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;; and another: &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;), and &#1502;&#1503; has the sense of the Arab. 'an, and is not the comparative, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a> : regard thy visit dearer than the house of a neighbour (Heidenheim). The proverb also is significant as to the relation of friend to friend, whose reciprocal love may be turned into hatred by too much intercourse and too great fondness. But &#1512;&#1506;&#1498; is including a friend, any one with whom we stand in any kind of intercourse. "Let him who seeks to be of esteem," says a German proverb, "come seldom;" and that may be said with reference to him whom his heart draws to another, and also to him who would be of use to another by drawing him out of the false way and guiding on the right path - a showing of esteem, a confirming of love by visiting, should not degenerate into forwardness which appears as burdensome servility, as indiscreet self-enjoyment; nor into a restless impetuosity, which seeks at once to gain by force that which one should allow gradually to ripen. </body></html>
