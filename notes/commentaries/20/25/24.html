Confidence in an unfaithful man is painful and vexatious; when we put any stress on him, he not only fails, but makes us feel for it. 20. We take a wrong course if we think to relieve those in sorrow by endeavouring to make them merry. 21,22. The precept to love even our enemies is an Old Testament commandment. Our Saviour has shown his own great example in loving us when we were enemies. 23. Slanders would not be so readily spoken, if they were not readily heard. Sin, if it receives any check, becomes cowardly. 24. It is better to be alone, than to be joined to one who is a hinderance to the comfort of life. 25. Heaven is a country afar off; how refreshing is good news from thence, in the everlasting gospel, which signifies glad tidings, and in the witness of the Spirit with our spirits that we are God's children! 26. When the righteous are led into sin, it is as hurtful as if the public fountains were poisoned. 27. We must be, through grace, dead to the pleasures of sense, and also to the praises of men. 28. The man who has no command over his anger, is easily robbed of peace. Let us give up ourselves to the Lord, and pray him to put his Spirit within us, and cause us to walk in his statutes.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

The first of the group represents a false tongue:<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-18.htm">Proverbs 25:18</a><p>18 A hammer, and a sword, and a sharp arrow - <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour.<p>An emblematic, or, as we might also say, an iconological proverb; for 18a is a quodlibet of instruments of murder, and 18b is the subscription under it: that which these weapons of murder accomplish, is done to his neighbour by a man who bears false witness against him - he ruins his estate, takes away his honour, but yet more: he murders him, at one time more grossly, at another time with more refinement; at one time slowly, at another time more quickly. &#1502;&#1508;&#1497;&#1509;, from &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509;, is equivalent to &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509;, and &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1509; from &#1504;&#1508;&#1509;; the Syr. and Targ. have instead &#1508;&#1491;&#1493;&#1506;&#1488; (&#1508;&#1491;&#1497;&#1506;&#1488;) from &#1508;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506;  equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1510;&#1506;; the word &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1488;, on which Hitzig builds a conjecture, is an error of transcription (vid., Lagarde and Levy). The expression, 18b, is from the decalogue, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-17.htm">Deuteronomy 5:17</a>. It is for the most part translated the same here as there: he who speaks against his neighbour as a false witness. But rightly the lxx, Jerome, the Venet., and Luther: false testimony. As &#1488;&#1500; sA .y signifies both that which is mighty  equals  power, and Him who is mighty  equals  God, so &#1506;&#1491; signifies both him who bears testimony and the testimony that is borne, properly that which repeats itself and thereby strengthens itself; accordingly we say &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1506;&#1491;, to give testimony in reply - viz. to the judge who asks - or generally to offer testimony (even unasked); as well as &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; &#1500;&#1506;&#1491;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-21.htm">Deuteronomy 31:21</a>, i.e., as evidence (Jerome, pro testimonio). The prep. &#1489; with this &#1506;&#1504;&#1492; has always the meaning of contra, also at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-33.htm">Genesis 30:33</a> is, however, open to question.</body></html>
