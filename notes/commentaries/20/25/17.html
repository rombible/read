Do not pay too frequent visits  to your neighbors' house, or make yourself too much at home there. The Son of Sirach has an utterance on a somewhat similar subject, "Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house.

The defective writing is like, e.g., &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1495;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a>, and gives no authority to prefer &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;  equals  &#1502;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (Bttcher). That &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;, corresponding to the plur. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;, is not used, arises from this, that &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; is here manifestly not a word without connection, but a sentence of motive, contents, and aim united. For &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, the meaning of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; presents itself from <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>, according to which, among the old interpreters, Symmachus, Jerome, and Luther render "at its time." Abulwald compared the Arab. a&#770;iffan (a&#770;ibban, also 'iffan, whence 'aly 'iffanihi, justo tempore), which, as Orelli has shown in his Synon. der Zeitbegriffe, p. 21f., comes from the roots af ab, to drive (from within) going out, time as consisting of individual moments, the one of which drives on the other, and thus denotes time as a course of succession. One may not hesitate as to the prep. &#1506;&#1500;, for &#1488;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; would, like &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, denote the circumstances, the relations of the time, and &#1506;&#1500; would, as e.g., in &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;, have the meaning of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;. But the form &#1488;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, which like &#1495;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a>, sounds dualistic, appears to oppose this. Hitzig supposes that &#1488;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; may designate the time as a circle, with reference to the two arches projecting in opposite directions, but uniting themselves together; but the circle which time describes runs out from one point, and, moreover, the Arab. names for time a&#770;faf, a&#770;ifaf, and the like, which interchange with a&#770;iffan, show that this does not proceed from the idea of circular motion. Ewald and others take for &#1488;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; the meaning of wheels (the Venet., after Kimchi, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;), whereby the form is to be interpreted as dual of &#1488;&#1508;&#1503;  equals  &#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503;, "a word driven on its wheels," - so Ewald explains: as the potter quickly and neatly forms a vessel on his wheels, thus a fit and quickly framed word. But &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; signifies to drive cattle and to speak  equals  to cause words to follow one another (cf. Arab. sya&#770;k&#803;, pressing on  equals  flow of words), but not to drive  equals  to fashion in that artisan sense. Otherwise Bttcher, "a word fitly spoken, a pair of wheels perfect in their motion," to which he compares the common people "in their jesting," and adduces all kinds of heterogeneous things partly already rejected by Orelli (e.g., the Homeric &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;, which is certainly no commendation). But "jesting" is not appropriate here; for what man conceives of human speech as a carriage, one only sometimes compares that of a babbler to a sledge, or says of him that he shoves the cart into the mud.<p>(Note: It is something different when the weaver's beam, minwa&#770;l in Arab., is metaph. for kind and manner: they are 'aly minwa&#770;l wa&#770;h&#803;ad, is equivalent to they are of a like calibre, Arab. kalib, which is derived from &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), a shoemaker's last.)<p>Is it then thus decided that &#1488;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; is a dual? It may be also like &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, the plur. especially in the adverbial expression before us, which readily carried the abbreviation with it (vid., Gesen. Lehrgebr. 134, Anm. 17). On this supposition, Orelli interprets &#1488;&#1508;&#1503; from &#1488;&#1508;&#1503;, to turn, in the sense of turning about, circumstances, and reminds of this, that in the post-bibl. Heb. this word is used as indefinitely as &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, e.g., &#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1508;&#1503; &#1502;&#1492;, quodammodo (vid., Reland's Analecta Rabbinica, 1723, p. 126). This late Talm. usage of the word can, indeed, signify nothing as to the bibl. word; but that &#1488;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, abbreviated &#1488;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, can mean circumstances, is warranted by the synon. &#1488;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;. Aquila and Theodotion appear to have thus understood it, for their &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;, which they substitute for the colourless &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; of the lxx, signifies: under the circumstances, in accordance therewith. So Orelli thus rightly defines: "&#1488;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; denote the a&#770;h&#803;wa&#770;l, circumstances and conditions, as they form themselves in each turning of time, and those which are ascribed to &#1491;&#1489;&#1512; by the suffix are those to which it is proper, and to which it fits in. Consequently a word is commended which is spoken whenever the precise time arrives to which it is adapted, a word which is thus spoken at its time as well as at its place (van Dyk, fay mahllah), and the grace of which is thereby heightened." Aben Ezra's explanation, &#1506;&#1500; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501;, in the approved way, follows the opinion of Abulwald and Parchon, that &#1488;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; is equivalent to &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; (cf. aly wajhihi, sua ratione), which is only so far true, that both words are derived from R. &#1508;&#1503;, to turn. In the figure, it is questionable whether by &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; &#1494;&#1492;&#1489;, apples of gold, or gold-coloured apples, are meant (Luther: as pomegranates and citrons); thus oranges are meant, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-12.htm">Zechariah 4:12</a>. &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;&#1489; denotes golden oil. Since &#1499;&#1505;&#1507;, besides, signifies a metallic substance, one appears to be under the necessity of thinking of apples of gold; cf. the brazen pomegranates. But (1) apples of gold of natural size and massiveness are obviously too great to make it probable that such artistic productions are meant; (2) the material of the emblem is usually not of less value than that of which it is the emblem (Fleischer); (3) the Scriptures are fond of comparing words with flowers and fruits, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-31.htm">Proverbs 10:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-2.htm">Proverbs 13:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-20.htm">Proverbs 18:20</a>, and to the essence of the word which is rooted in the spirit, and buds and grows up to maturity through the mouth and the lips, the comparison with natural fruits corresponds better in any case than with artificial. Thus, then, we interpret "golden apples" as the poetic name for oranges, aurea mala, the Indian name of which with reference to or (gold) was changed into the French name orange, as our pomeranze is equivalent to pomum aurantium. &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is the plur. of &#1502;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, already explained, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-11.htm">Proverbs 18:11</a>; the word is connected neither with &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1498;, to twist, wreathe (Ewald, with most Jewish interpreters)<p>(Note: On this proceeds also the beautiful interpretation by Maimuni in the preface to More Nebuchim: Maskiyyth sont des ciselures rticulaires, etc., according to Munk's translation from the Arab. text, vid., Kohut's Pers. Pentateuch-Uebers. (1871), p. 356. Accordingly Jewish interpreters (e.g., Elia Wilna) understand under &#1488;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; the four kinds of writing: &#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;, &#1512;&#1502;&#1494;, &#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, and &#1505;&#1493;&#1491;, which are comprehended under the memorial word &#1508;&#1512;&#1491;&#1505;.)<p>nor with &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492;, to pierce, infigere (Redslob, vid., under <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-7.htm">Psalm 73:7</a>); it signifies medal or ornament, from &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1492;, to behold (cf. &#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;  equals  &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6</a>), here a vessel which is a delight to the eyes. In general the Venet. rightly, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; Symmachus and Theodotion, more in accordance with the fundamental idea, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; the Syr. and Targ. specially: in vessels of embossed work (&#1504;&#1490;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;, from &#1504;&#1490;&#1491;, to draw, to extend); yet more specially the lxx, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, on a chain of cornelian stone, for which, perhaps, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#837; (Jger) &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, in a little silver basket, is the original phrase. Aquila, after Bereschith rabba c. 93, translates by &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;. Jerome: in lectis argenteis, appears to have fallen into the error of taking &#1502;&#1513;&#1489; for &#1502;&#1513;&#1499;&#1489;, lectus. Hitzig here emends a self-made &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. Luther's "golden apples in silver baskets" is to be preferred.<p>(Note: A favourite expression of Goethe's, vid., Bchmann's Geflgelte Worte, 1688.)<p>A piece of sculpture which represents fruit by golden little disks or points within groups of leaves is not meant - for the proverb does not speak of such pretty little apples - but golden oranges are meant. A word in accordance with the circumstances which occasion it, is like golden oranges which are handed round in silver salvers or on silver waiters. Such a word is, as adopting another figure we might say, like a well-executed picture, and the situation into which it appropriately fits is like its elegant frame. The comparison with fruit is, however, more significant; it designates the right word as a delightful gift, in a way which heightens its impression and its influences. </body></html>
