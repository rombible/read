But it is the honour of rulers to search out matters, to bring to light hidden works of darkness. 4,5. For a prince to suppress vice, and reform his people, is the best way to support his government. 6,7. Religion teaches us humility and self-denial. He who has seen the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus, will feel his own unworthiness. 8-10. To be hasty in beginning strife, will bring into difficulties. War must at length end, and might better be prevented. It is so in private quarrels; do all thou canst to settle the matter. 11,12. A word of counsel, or reproof, rightly spoken, is especially beautiful, as fine fruit becomes still more beautiful in silver baskets. 13. See what ought to be the aim of him that is trusted with any business; to be faithful. A faithful minister, Christ's messenger, should be thus acceptable to us. 14. He who pretends to have received or given that which he never had, is like the morning cloud, that disappoints those who look for rain. 15. Be patient to bear a present hurt. Be mild to speak without passion; for persuasive language is the most effectual to prevail over the hardened mind. 16. God has given us leave to use grateful things, but we are cautioned against excess.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The interpretation of the proverb of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-4.htm">Proverbs 25:4</a>.

Wicked ministers and counsellors; they are the "dross", worthless and useless; yea, hurtful and pernicious. The king is the "refiner", for whom the vessel is; the kingdom is the silver vessel refined; and which becomes much the better, when wicked men are removed from the court and cabinet council of kings; as well as the king is the happier, and his throne more firm and secure, as follows: <p>and his throne shall be established in righteousness; which he shall execute, wicked ministers being removed from him, who advised him to take unrighteous measures; and others being put in their room, who counsel him to do acts of justice; whereby his throne is secured, and he sits firm upon it, which before was tottering and shaking, and lie in great danger of being removed from it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Take <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> away the wicked <i>from</i> before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</span><p>(g) It is not enough that he is pure himself, but that he put away others who are corrupted.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take away the wicked from before the king.</span> Let the wicked be removed from the presence of the king, as dross is separated from the pure silver (see the same metaphor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-29.htm">Jeremiah 6:29</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And his throne shall be established in righteousness</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-12.htm">Proverbs 16:12</a>: 29:14).

The form of the narrative in which this warning against drowsy slothfulness is clothed, is like <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-35.htm">Psalm 37:35</a>. The distinguishing of different classes of men by &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-20.htm">Proverbs 24:20</a>) is common in proverbial poetry. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, at the close of the first parallel member, retains its Pathach unchanged.
