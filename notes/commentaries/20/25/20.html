Confidence in an unfaithful man is painful and vexatious; when we put any stress on him, he not only fails, but makes us feel for it. 20. We take a wrong course if we think to relieve those in sorrow by endeavouring to make them merry. 21,22. The precept to love even our enemies is an Old Testament commandment. Our Saviour has shown his own great example in loving us when we were enemies. 23. Slanders would not be so readily spoken, if they were not readily heard. Sin, if it receives any check, becomes cowardly. 24. It is better to be alone, than to be joined to one who is a hinderance to the comfort of life. 25. Heaven is a country afar off; how refreshing is good news from thence, in the everlasting gospel, which signifies glad tidings, and in the witness of the Spirit with our spirits that we are God's children! 26.

Either takes it off of himself, or another person, when it would be rather more proper to put another garment on, and so is exposed to the injury of cold weather; <p>and as vinegar upon nitre: nitre was found in Egypt, beyond Memphis, as Strabo says (p); there were two mines of nitre, which produced much, and thence it was called the Nitriotic Nome: others say, nitre has its name from Nitria, a town in Egypt (q), which gives name to the Nitrian desert, where there is a lake called Latron; from the bottom of which, that sort of nitre, called Natron, arises to the top, as is apprehended, and there, by the heat of the sun, condenses into this kind of substance (r), which will react with an acid; and so vinegar poured upon it will irritate and disturb it, cause it to react, and make a noise and a hissing. This must be understood only of this sort of nitre, of the nitre of the ancients; not of the moderns, which is no other than saltpetre; for though this will ferment with vinegar, saltpetre will not (s): nitre is dissolved by a liquid, but not any, only that which is cold, as Aristotle observes (t), as is vinegar; and therefore, with great propriety, this is joined to what goes before; <p>so is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart; rather distresses and afflicts him the more; as he cannot sing himself, he cannot bear to hear others sing; such rather should be condoled and wept with than to have songs sung to them. Some understand the words in a sense the reverse; the word rendered taketh away, in the first clause, has the signification of adorning with a garment; hence they render it, "as he that putteth on a garment (u) for ornament in cold weather, and as vinegar to nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart"; that is, as an additional garment drives away cold, and vinegar dissolves nitre, so singing songs to a heavy hearted man drives away sorrow; as in the case of Saul, such an effect had music on him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>; or rather, to put on a thin garment for ornament in cold weather is as absurd and unseasonable as to put vinegar to nitre, or to a wound, as Schultens, and to sing songs to a heavy heart; all absurd. <p>(p) Geograph. l. 17. p. 552.

The substance meant is not saltpetre, which is now what we understand by nitre, but native carbonate of soda, which was found, as Pliny tells us, in the Soda Lakes of Egypt (Smith’s <span class="ital">Dict. of Bible</span>, Art. <span class="bld">nitre</span>). The <span class="ital">untimeliness</span> of singing songs to a heavy heart is illustrated by the first comparison. It is doing exactly the opposite of that which the circumstances demand. It is like taking off a garment just when one ought to put it on. The second comparison teaches vividly that the action which is thus untimely is also irritating when it ought to be soothing, and hurtful when it ought to be helpful. It is like “vinegar on nitre,” like acid on soda, which produces effervescence, calling into active exercise the natural antipathies of the substances, and destroying the virtue of the soda.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather.</span> The proverb gives three instances of what is wrong, incongruous, or unwise, the first two leading up to the third, which is the pith of the maxim. But them is some doubt about the rendering of the first clause. The Authorized Version has the authority of the Syriac, Aquila, and others, and gives an appropriate sense, the unreasonable proceeding being the laying aside of some of one's own clothes in cold weather. But the verb here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">adah</span>), may also mean "to adorn," <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, with fine garments; hence some expositors understand the incongruity to be the dressing one's self in gay apparel in winter. But, as Delitzsch remarks, there is no reason why fine clothes should not be warm; and if they are so, there is nothing unreasonable in wearing them. The rendering of our version is probably correct. St. Jerome annexes this line to the preceding verse, as if it confirmed the previous instances of misplaced confidence, <span class="accented">Et amittit pallium in die frigoris</span>. "Such a one loses his cloak in a day of frost." <span class="cmt_word">Vinegar upon nitre.</span> Our nitre, or saltpetre, is nitrate of potash, which is not the substance intended by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">nether</span>). The substance signified by this term is a natural alkali, known to the ancients as natron, and composed of carbonate of soda with some other admixture. It was used extensively for washing purposes, and in cookery and bread making. It effervesces with an acid, such as vinegar, and changes its character, becoming a salt, and being rendered useless for all the purposes to which it was applied in its alkaline condition. So he who pours vinegar on natron does a foolish thing, for he spoils a highly useful article, and produces one which is of no service to him. Septuagint, "As vinegar is inexpedient for a wound (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), so suffering falling on the body pains the heart." Schulteus, Ewald, and others, by referring <span class="accented">nether</span> to an Arabic source, obtain the meaning "wound," or "sore," titus: "As vinegar on a sore." This gives a most appropriate sense, and might well be adopted if it had sufficient authority. But this is doubtful. Cornelius a Lapide translates the Septuagint rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f6d;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Sicut acetum trahit inutile;" and explains that vinegar draws from the soil the nitre which is prejudicial to vegetation, and thus renders ground fertile - a fact in agricultural chemistry not generally known, though Columella vouches for it. A somewhat similar fact, however, is of common experience. Land occasionally becomes what farmers term "sour," and is thus sterile; if it is then dressed with salt. its fertillity is restored. So is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart. The inconsistency lies in thinking to cheer a sorrowful heart by singing merry songs. "A tale out of season," says Siracides, "is as music in mourning" (Ecclus. 22:6). The Greeks denoted cruel incongruity by the proverb, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; "Ludere inter maerentes." As the old hymn says -  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Strains of gladness<br />Suit not souls with anguish torn."</span> The true Christian sympathy teaches to "rejoice with them that rejoice, to weep with them that weep" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>). Plumptre, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' suggests that the effervescence caused by the mixture of acid and alkali is taken as a type of the irritation produced by the inopportune songs. But this is importing a modern view into a paragraph, such as would never have occurred to the writer. The Septuagint, followed partially by Jerome, the Syriac, and the Targum, introduces another proverb not found in the Hebrew, "As a moth in a garment, and a worm in wood, so the sorrow of a man hurts his heart." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This proverb relates to the word which promises much, but remains unaccomplished:<p>Clouds and wind, and yet no rain - <p>A man who boasteth with a false gift.<p>Incorrectly the lxx and Targ. refer the predicate contained in the concluding word of the first line to all the three subjects; and equally incorrectly Hitzig, with Heidenheim, interprets &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;, of a gift that has been received of which one boasts, although it is in reality of no value, because by a lying promise a gift is not at all obtained. But as &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1499;&#1494;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-3.htm">Proverbs 23:3</a>, is bread which, as it were, deceives him who eats it, so &#1502;&#1514;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512; is a gift which amounts to a lie, i.e., a deceitful pretence. Rightly Jerome: vir gloriosus et promissa non complens. In the Arab. s&#803;alid&#803;, which Fleischer compares, the figure 14a and its counterpart 14b are amalgamated, for this word signifies both a boaster and a cloud, which is, as it were, boastful, which thunders much, but rains only sparsely or not at all. Similar is the Arab. khullab, clouds which send forth lightning, and which thunder, but yet give no rain; we say to one, magno promissor hiatu: thou art (Arab.) kabarak&#803;n khullabin, i.e., as Lane translates it: "Thou art only like lightning with which is no rain." Schultens refers to this proverbial Arabic, fulmen nubis infecundae. Liberality is called (Arab.) nadnay, as a watering, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>. The proverb belongs to this circle of figures. It is a saying of the German peasants, "Wenn es sich wolket, so will es regnen" [when it is cloudy, then there will be rain]; but according to another saying, "nicht alle Wolken regnen" [it is not every cloud that yields rain]. "There are clouds and wind without rain." </body></html>
