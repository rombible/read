He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head. 3. Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God, are changed. 4,5. We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his conscience, so as may best end the debate. 6-9. Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings, as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness. 10. This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among men should disgrace and punish the wicked. 11. The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their vices, 2Pe 2:22. 12. We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really it is very bad. 13. The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion. 14. Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they are not the nearer to heaven. 15. The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer. 16. He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master, and that his labour shall not be in vain. 17. To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves into temptation. 18,19. He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. 20-22. Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers and backbiters. 23. A wicked heart disguising itself, is like a potsherd covered with the dross of silver.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal reference note.

And moves this way and that way, and opens and shuts, and yet hangs where it did, is not moved from its place: <p>so doth the slothful upon his bed; he turns himself from side to side, but is still on his bed, and does not move out of it, and go about his business. Aben Ezra makes mention of another reading and sense, "the door turneth upon his hinges", and is opened to let men out, one and another, to his work; "but yet the slothful man is upon his bed"; though one and another rise and go about business, and he hears the door open again and again, he stirs not, but keeps his, bed. So profane sinners lie on the bed of sinful lusts and sensual pleasures, indulge themselves in chambering and wantonness, and do not care to rise from hence, and walk honestly as in the daytime; and though their consciences are sometimes jogged by inward pricks, and they are moved a little by the reproofs of their friends, or awakened by the judgments of God; yet these are quickly over, and they give themselves a turn and go to sleep again: sometimes there are some motions in them, some thoughts and resolutions of amendment, some purposes to do good works; but, alas! their slothfulness is so great, and the habits and customs of sin so strong, that they cannot break through them, shake off their sloth, and come out, but remain as they were: and so it is with carnal professors, resting in their own works, and in a round of duties; and after ten, twenty, thirty years' profession, or more, they are just where they were; have no spiritual knowledge, judgment, and experience. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. “He will not get up in the morning; he turns from side to side, just like a door which swings backward and forward upon its hinges, but of course never gets any further.” Horton, ch. xx. p. 263, where a graphic picture of the sluggard is drawn by bringing together the different notices of him in the Book of Proverbs.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the door turneth upon its hinges.</span> The door moves on its hinges and makes no progress beyond its own confined sphere of motion; so the slothful man turns himself on his bed from side to side, but never leaves it to do his. work. Other analogies have been found in this proverb. Thus: The door opens to let the diligent go forth to his daily business, while the sluggard is rolling upon his bed; the door creaks when it is moved, so the lazy man groans when he is aroused; the door now is opened, now is shut, so the sluggard at one time intends to rise, and then falls back in his bed, and returns to his sleep (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-9.htm">Proverbs 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/24-33.htm">Proverbs 24:33</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This proverb presents to us a new difficulty.<p>As one binds a stone in a sling,<p>So is he who giveth honour to a fool.<p>This translation is warranted by tradition, and is in accordance with the actual facts. A sling is elsewhere called &#1511;&#1500;&#1506;; but that &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; also in the passage before us signifies a sling (from &#1512;&#1490;&#1501;, to throw with stones  equals  to stone or to throw stones  equals  to sling, cf. Targ. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-14.htm">Esther 5:14</a> &#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, of David's slinging stones against Goliath), is supported by the lxx, Syr., and Targ. on the one side, and the Jewish Glossists on the other (Rashi: fronde, Ital. frombola). Rightly the lxx renders &#1499;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512; as a verb: &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;; on the contrary, the Syr. and Targ. regard it as a substantive: as a piece of stone; but &#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512; as a substantive does not mean a piece, as one would put into a sling to use as a weapon, but a grain, and thus a little piece, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-13.htm">2 Samuel 17:13</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>. Erroneously Ewald: "if one binds to the sling the stone which he yet seeks to throw, then all this throwing and aiming are in vain; so it is in vain to give to a fool honour which does not reach him." If one seeks to sling a stone, he must lay the lapis missilis so in the sling that it remains firm there, and goes forth only by the strong force of the slinging; this fitting in (of the stone), so that it does not of itself fall out, is expressed by &#1510;&#1512;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-8.htm">Job 26:8</a>). The giving is compared to the binding, the stones to the honour, and the sling to the fool: the fool is related to the honour which one confers on him, as the stone to the sling in which one lays it - the giving of honour is a slinging of honour. Otherwise (after Kimchi) the Venet. &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;, i.e., as Fleischer translates: ut qui crumenam gemmarum plenam in acervum lapidum conjicit. Thus also Ralbag, Ahron b. Josef, and others, and lastly Zckler. The figure is in the form of an address, and &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; (from &#1512;&#1490;&#1501;, accumulare, congerere, vid., under <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/67-1.htm">Psalm 67:1-7</a> :28) might certainly mean the heaping of stones. But &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; is not used in the sense of &#1488;&#1489;&#1503; &#1497;&#1511;&#1512;&#1492; (precious stone); also one does not see why one precious stone is not enough as the figure of honour, and a whole heap is named; but in the third place, &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1503; requires for &#1499;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512; a verbal signification. Therefore Jerome translates: sicut qui mittit lapidem in acervum Mercurii; in this the echo of his Jewish teacher, for the Midrash thus explains literally: every one who gives honour to a fool is like one who throws a stone on a heap of stones consecrated to Mercury. Around the Hermes (&#x3b5;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;), i.e., pillars with the head of Mercury (statuae mercuriales or viales), were heaps of stones (&#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;), to which the passer-by was wont to throw a stone; it was a mark of honour, and served at the same time to improve the way, whose patron was Mercurious (&#1502;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;). It is self-evident that this Graeco-Roman custom to which the Talm. makes frequent reference, cannot be supposed to have existed in the times of Solomon. Luther translates independently, and apparently rendering into German that in acervum Mercurii: that is as if one threw a precious stone on the "Rabenstein," i.e., the heap of stones raised at the foot of the gallows. This heap of stones is more natural and suitable to the times of Solomon than the heap of stones dedicated to Mercury, if, like Gussetius, one understands &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1502;&#1492; of a heap of stones, supra corpus lapidatum. But against this and similar interpretations it is enough to remark that &#1499;&#1510;&#1512;&#1493;&#1512; cannot signify sicut qui mittit. Had such a meaning been intended, the word would have been &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; or &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;. Still different is the rendering of Joseph Kimchi, Aben Ezra, and finally Lwenstein: as when one wraps up a stone in a piece of purple stuff. But &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503;, purple, has nothing to do with the verb &#1512;&#1490;&#1501;; it is, as the Aramaic &#1488;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; shows, a compound word; the supposition of a denom. &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; thus proceeds from a false etymological supposition. And Hitzig's combination of &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1502;&#1492; with (Arab.) munjam, handle and beam of a balance (he translates: as a stone on the beam of a balance, i.e., lies on it), is nothing but refined ingenuity, since we have no need at all of such an Arab. word for a satisfactory clearing up of &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1502;&#1492;. We abide by the rendering of the sling. Bttcher translates: a sling that scatters; perhaps &#1502;&#1512;&#1490;&#1502;&#1492; in reality denotes such a sling as throws many stones at once. Let that, however, be as it may: that he who confers a title of honour, a place of honour, and the like, on a fool, is like one who lays a stone in a sling, is a true and intelligibly formed thought: the fool makes the honour no honour; he is not capable of maintaining it; that which is conferred on him is uselessly wasted. </body></html>
