Always distrust when a man speaks fair unless you know him well. Satan, in his temptations, speaks fair, as he did to Eve; but it is madness to give credit to him. 27. What pains men take to do mischief to others! but it is digging a pit, it is rolling a stone, hard work; and they prepare mischief to themselves. 28. There are two sorts of lies equally detestable. A slandering lie, the mischief of this every body sees. A flattering lie, which secretly works ruin.

That is, a man of a lying tongue, that is given to lying, hates those that are hurt and crushed by his lies; the reason why he hurts them with his lies is because he hates them; and, having hurt them, he hates them, being made his enemies, and from whom he may expect and be in fear of revenge: moreover, he hates those that are troubled at and disturbed with his lies; or the "contrite" (p) and humble men: or those who "smite" or "strike" (q) him, as some render the word, actively; that is, reprove him, and bring him to shame for lying. The words are by some translated, a "contrite" person, or everyone of "the contrite ones, hateth a lying tongue" (r); such as are of a broken and of a contrite spirit, and that tremble at the word of God, or are hurt by lies, these abhor a liar. The Targum is, <p>"a lying tongue bates the ways of truth;'' <p>and the Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, render it, "a lying tongue hate truth"; and so the Vulgate Latin version, "a lying tongue loves not truth"; for nothing is more contrary to a lie than truth; <p>and a flattering mouth worketh ruin; both to itself and to the persons flattered by it: or, "makes an impulse" (s); a pushing, a driving away; it drives away such as cannot bear its flatteries: and pushes on such that are taken with it, both into sin and into ruin. <p>(p) "contritos suos", Montanus, Michaelis.

There is a consensus of the Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac, and Targum to translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5db;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> "truth," thinking apparently of the Aramaean <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> "that which is pure." But the hemistich would thus state the baldest truism, and modern commentators unite in assigning to the word some such sense as that given above in the Authorized Version. A liar shows his want of charity by slandering his neighbour; and that men dislike those whom they have injured is a common experience. "It is a characteristic of human nature," says Tacitus ('Agric.,' 42), "to hate those whom one has injured." Seneca, 'De Ira,' 2:83, "Hoe habent pessimum animi magna fortuna insolentes, quos laeserunt, et oderunt." <span class="cmt_word">A flattering mouth worketh ruin</span>; brings destruction on those who succumb to its seductive words. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Os lubricum operatur ruinas</span>; Septuagint, "A mouth uncovered (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) causeth tumults." (For "the smooth mouth," comp. ch. 5:3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-3.htm">Psalm 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-21.htm">Psalm 55:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>.) The word for "tumults" is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which does not occur elsewhere in the Septuagint, but is common in the New Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-9.htm">Luke 21:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>22 The words of the tale-bearer are like dainty morsels;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they glide down into the innermost parts.<p>A repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-8.htm">Proverbs 18:8</a>. </body></html>
