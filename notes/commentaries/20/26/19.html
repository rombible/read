He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head. 3. Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God, are changed. 4,5. We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his conscience, so as may best end the debate. 6-9. Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings, as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness. 10. This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among men should disgrace and punish the wicked. 11. The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their vices, 2Pe 2:22. 12. We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really it is very bad. 13. The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion. 14. Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they are not the nearer to heaven. 15. The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer. 16. He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master, and that his labour shall not be in vain. 17. To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves into temptation. 18,19. He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. 20-22. Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers and backbiters. 23. A wicked heart disguising itself, is like a potsherd covered with the dross of silver.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The teacher cuts off the plea which people make when they have hurt their neighbor by lies, that they "did not mean mischief," that they were "only in fun."

By telling him a lie; or by reporting false things concerning him; or by cheating him in trade and commerce; or by taking his goods privately from him; and, when caught in either of these, <p>and saith, Am not I in sport? do not be angry, I designed no hurt; it is all in jest, a mere joke: but, had he not been apprehended, it would have been in earnest, as he was. This is only an excuse, and as absurd an one as if a man should set fire to his neighbour's house and barns, or throw arrows at him, or strike him with any instrument of death, as the sword, &amp;c. and then say he was only in jest, or pretend madness. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> deceiveth <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?</span><p>(i) Who disguises himself to be that which he is not.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">in sport</span>] Fatal mischief may come of thoughtlessness apart from malice.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There follows now a group of proverbs regarding the slothful:<p>13 The slothful saith there is a lion without,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lion in the midst of the streets;<p>cf. the original of this proverb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-13.htm">Proverbs 22:13</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, to say nothing of &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1500;, is not the jackal; &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1500; is the bibl. name for the lion. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; is the more general expression for &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; by the streets he thinks of the rows of houses that form them. </body></html>
