Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:2</a> might be quoted in illustration of it. If fools and transgressors will set their mind upon “husks” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-16.htm" title="And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave to him.">Luke 15:16</a>) instead of the food God has provided for His children, He does not deny it to them; they have the reward they seek for. But the Hebrew can hardly yield this meaning. Of all the various renderings suggested, perhaps the most unobjectionable is as follows. <span class= "ital">A master </span>(one skilled in his art), <span class= "ital">produces everything </span>(by his own care and oversight he sees himself that it is properly done); <span class= "ital">but a fool hires </span>(others to do his work), <span class= "ital">and he hires passers by., </span>i.e., any casual person that comes in his way, whether skilled or not, and so the work is done badly.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/proverbs/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-10.htm" title="The great God that formed all things both rewards the fool, and rewards transgressors.">Proverbs 26:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">The great God formed all things, </span>&c. — The Hebrew text of this verse will admit of different translations, as the reader may see by the margin, and commentators are much divided in their opinions of its meaning. The Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">רב</span>, <span class="ital">rab, </span>here rendered <span class="ital">great, </span>may be applied either to God or to a prince, and the proverb may be considered as declaring either how God the Creator and Governor of the universe will deal with sinners, or how kings and princes ought to act toward their subjects. Bishop Patrick’s paraphrase, which includes both, seems to give the most probable sense of the verse, thus: “The great God, who made all things, governs them also most wisely and equally; dispensing, for instance, his punishments suitable to men’s sins, whether out of ignorance, or of wilful wickedness; whom a good prince imitates; but a bad one proves a universal grievance, by employing either fools or profane persons in his service, who vex the rest of his subjects.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/proverbs/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:2. He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head. 3. Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God, are changed. 4,5. We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his conscience, so as may best end the debate. 6-9. Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings, as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness. 10. This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among men should disgrace and punish the wicked. 11. The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their vices, 2Pe 2:22. 12. We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really it is very bad. 13. The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion. 14. Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they are not the nearer to heaven. 15. The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer. 16. He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master, and that his labour shall not be in vain. 17. To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves into temptation. 18,19. He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. 20-22. Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers and backbiters. 23.

So the sense is, It is the manner of many princes to vex and oppress their subjects, which because they cannot do by themselves alone, they hire others, both fools, who do not know or consider what they do, and transgressors, who are ready to execute all their commands, right or wrong, that they may be their instruments in that work. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The great God, that formed all things,....

The number and variety of interpretations which have been given to this verse justify the remark of R.V. marg. that “The Hebrew is obscure.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The rendering of R.V. text is: As <span class="ital">an archer</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm" title="His archers compass me round about, he splits my reins asunder, and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.">Job 16:13</a>, where the same Heb. word is so rendered) <span class="ital">that woundeth all, so is he that hireth the fool</span> and he that <span class="ital">hireth them that pass by</span>. But the objection to this is that instead of <span class="ital">the fool</span> being the main subject, as he is in all this group of proverbs, he is out of place, and the introduction of him mars the symmetry of the proverb, which should run: As an archer who wounds every one within his reach, friend and foe alike, so is a master who hires all who pass by, good workman and bad indifferently.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For this reason, if for no other, the rendering of R.V. margin is to be preferred: <span class="bld">A master-worker formeth all things</span> (we may supply in thought, either (1) and in order to do so makes wise choice of his instruments, or (2) he therefore is wise who employs such an one); <span class="bld">but he that hireth the fool is as he that hireth them that pass by</span>—every unskilled instrument that comes to his hand.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The introduction of the word <span class="ital">God</span> in A.V. is without authority, and the sense given by it to the proverb is less pertinent.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Few passages have given greater difficulty than this verse; almost every word has been differently explained. The Authorized Version is, <span class="cmt_word">The great God that formed all things</span> <span class="cmt_word">both rewardeth the fool, and</span> re-<span class="cmt_word">wardeth</span> transgressors; Revised Version, <span class="accented">As an archer</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-13.htm">Job 16:13</a>) <span class="accented">that woundeth all</span>, <span class="accented">so is he that hireth the fool and he that hireth thorn that pass by</span>. At first sight one would hardly suppose that these could be versions of the same passage. To show the diversity that obtained in early times we quote the Greek and Latin versions. Septuagint, "All the flesh of fools is much distressed (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), for their distraction (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is brought to nought;" Vulgate, "Judgment decides causes, and he who imposes silence on a fool appeases wrath." From the various interpretations of which this proverb is capable, it may be surmised that it was originally one of those hard sayings which were intended to exercise the ingenuity of auditors. It has certainly had that effect in modern times. We may at once eliminate the rendering of the Authorized Version, though the sense is good and scriptural, denoting that the great Creator recompenses the good and punishes sinners. So the medieval jingle - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ante Dei vultum nihil unquam restat inultum."</span> God is not in the Hebrew, and <span class="accented">rab</span>, "great," is never used absolutely as equivalent to "God." Nor is the word used elsewhere to mean "head workman;" so the Revised Version margin, "a master worker formeth all things," is suspicious. Some translate, "A great man woundeth [equivalent to 'punisheth'] all; he renders their due to fools and to transgressors." One does not see why this should be attributed to the great man; it certainly is not generally true. Rosenmuller, "The mighty man causes terror; so does he who hires the fool and the transgressor;" but it is not clear why the hiring of a fool should occasion terror. The rendering in the Revised Version, or something very similar, has found favour with many modern commentators, though quite unknown to the mere ancient versions. According to this interpretation, the proverb says that a careless, random way of doing business, taking into one's service fools, or entrusting matters of importance to any chance loiterer, is as dangerous as shooting arrows about recklessly without caring whither they flew or whom they wounded. To this view Nowack objects that it is unparalleled to present an archer as a picture of what is unusual and profitless; that it does not explain why "hireth" is twice repeated; that the connection between shooter and the hire of fool and loiterer is net obvious; and that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> does not mean "vagabonds" or "passers by." None of these objections are of much importance; and this interpretation still holds its ground. There is also much to be said for the rendering of the Revised Version margin, which is virtually that of Gesenius, Fleischer, Wordsworth, Nutt, and others: A skilful man, a master workman, produces, makes, everything by his own care and superintendence; but he that hires a fool to do his work hires, as it were, any casual vagabond who may know nothing of the business. One objection to this interpretation is that the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, does not elsewhere have the meaning here attributed to it. Considering all the above interpretations unsatisfactory, Hitzig, after Umbreit, followed herein by Delitzsch and Nowack, translates, "Much bringeth forth all," which means that he who possesses much can do anything, or, as St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>, "Whosoever hath, to him shall be given" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>). But the second hemistich comes in rather lamely, "But he who hires a fool is as one who hires a vagabond." Hence Delitzsch reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> for the first <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>, and renders, "But the hire and the hirer of the fool pass away," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. what the fool gets as wages is soon squandered, and the person who took him into his service is ruined by his incapacity. In this case the connection of the two clauses would be this: A rich man, in the nature of things, grows richer; but there are exceptions to this rule; for he who employs stupid and incapable people to do his business suffers for it in property, reputation, and probably in person also; and the incompetent person derives no benefit from the connection. It is impossible to give a decided preference to any of these expositions; and the passage must be left as a crux. It is most probable that the Hebrew text is defective. This would account for the great variations in the versions. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>4 Answer not the fool according to his folly,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest thou thyself also become like unto him.<p>After, or according to his folly, is here equivalent to recognising the foolish supposition and the foolish object of his question, and thereupon considering it, as if, e.g., he asked why the ignorant man was happier than the man who had much knowledge, or how one may acquire the art of making gold; for "a fool can ask more than ten wise men can answer." He who recognises such questions as justifiable, and thus sanctions them, places himself on an equality with the fool, and easily himself becomes one.
