He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head. 3. Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God, are changed. 4,5. We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his conscience, so as may best end the debate. 6-9. Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings, as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness. 10. This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among men should disgrace and punish the wicked. 11. The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their vices, 2Pe 2:22. 12. We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really it is very bad. 13. The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion. 14. Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they are not the nearer to heaven. 15. The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer. 16. He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master, and that his labour shall not be in vain. 17. To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves into temptation. 18,19. He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. 20-22. Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers and backbiters. 23.

Either burning with wrath and malice; breathing out threatenings and slaughter; pursuing men with reproaches and slanders, arising from a wicked heart: or rather, burning with profession of love to God, and affection to good men; with great pretensions of kindness, and promises of good things, when their hearts are wicked, and they design noticing less; say one thing with their lips, with the greatest show of affection and sincerity, and mean another in their hearts. These <p>are like a potsherd covered with silver dross: which at a distance, or to less discerning persons, looks like silver, and is taken for it; when the covering is only dross, and what is within is only a potsherd, Or a piece of an earthen vessel, good for nothing: such are the specious professions and deceitful words, which flow from a wicked heart. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Burning lips and <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> a wicked heart <i>are like</i> a potsherd covered with silver dross.</span><p>(k) They will soon break out and utter themselves.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">burning</span>] Better, <span class="bld">fervent</span>, R.V., with protestations of affection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a potsherd covered</span>] The rendering, <span class="bld">an earthen vessel overlaid</span>, R.V. makes the meaning clearer.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - The next proverbs are concerned with hypocrisy. The Hebrew denotes the comparison simply by position (see on Proverbs 25:11), thus: <span class="cmt_word">An earthen vessel</span> (or, <span class="accented">potsherd</span>) <span class="cmt_word">overlaid with silver dross</span> - <span class="cmt_word">growing lips and a wicked heart.</span> So called "silver dross" is litharge, an oxide of lead used to this day to put a glaze on pottery (comp. Ecclus. 38:30). The comparatively worthless article is thus made to assume a fine appearance. Thus lips that seem to burn with affection, and give the kiss of glowing, love, may mask a heart filled with envy and hatred Judas kisses and words of friendship hide the bad feelings that lurk within. Septuagint, "Silver given with guile is to be considered as a potsherd; smooth (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) lips hide a grievous heart" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A series of proverbs which recommend the love of peace, for they present caricatures of the opposite:<p>17 He seizeth by the ears of a dog passing by,<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is excited by a strife which concerns him not.<p>According to the accentuation in the text, the proverb is to be translated with Fleischer: Qualis est qui prehendit aures canis, talis est qui forte transiens ira abripitur propter rixam alienam (eique temere se immiscent). Since he is cautioned against unwarranted interference, the expression &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1503; might have been used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-10.htm">Proverbs 14:10</a>), according to which the Syr. translates; but &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; substantiates the originality of &#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a>). On the other hand, the placing together, without any connection of the two participles, is perplexing; why not &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;? For it is certainly not meant, that falling into a passion he passes by; but that passing by, he falls into a passion; for he stands to this object. The Targumist, feeling this also, renders &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; in the sense of being angry, but contrary to the usus loq. Wherefore the conjecture of Euchel and Abramsohn commends itself, that &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; belongs to &#1499;&#1500;&#1489; - the figure thereby becomes more distinct. To seize one's own dog by the ear is not dangerous, but it is not advisable to do this with a strange dog. Therefore &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; belongs as a necessary attribute to the dog. The dog accidentally passing by corresponds to the strife to which one stands in no relation (&#1512;&#1497;&#1489; &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1493;&#1500;, vid., regarding the Makkeph, Baer's Genesis, p. 85, not. 9). Whoever is excited to passion about a strife that does not belong to him, is like one who lays hold by the ears (the lxx arbitrarily: by the tail) of a dog that is passing by - to the one or to the other it happens right when he brings evil upon himself thereby. </body></html>
