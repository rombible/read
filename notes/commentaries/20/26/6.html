He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head. 3. Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God, are changed. 4,5. We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his conscience, so as may best end the debate. 6-9. Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings, as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness. 10. This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among men should disgrace and punish the wicked. 11. The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their vices, 2Pe 2:22. 12. We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really it is very bad. 13. The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion. 14. Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they are not the nearer to heaven. 15. The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer. 16. He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master, and that his labour shall not be in vain. 17. To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves into temptation. 18,19. He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. 20-22. Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers and backbiters. 23. A wicked heart disguising itself, is like a potsherd covered with the dross of silver.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cutteth off the feet - Mutilates him, spoils the work which the messenger ought to fulfill.<p>Drinketh damage - i. e., "has to drink full draughts of shame and loss" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Who knows not how to deliver it in a proper manner, and is incapable of taking the answer, and reporting it as he should; or unfaithful in it, and brings a bad or false report, as the spies did upon the good land; <p>cutteth off the feet; he may as well cut off his feet before he sends him, or send a man without feet, as such an one; for prudence, diligence, and faithfulness in doing a message, and bringing back the answer, are as necessary to a messenger as his feet are; <p>and drinketh damage; to himself; his message not being rightly performed, and business not done well; which is a loss to the sender, as well as to his credit and reputation with the person to whom he sends him; he hereby concluding that he must be a man of no great judgment and sense to send such a fool on his errand. Such are the unskilful ambassadors of princes; and such are unfaithful ministers, the messengers of the churches; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-26.htm">Proverbs 10:26</a>. The words in the original are three sentences, without a copulative, and stand in this order, "he that cutteth off feet; he that drinketh damage; he that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool"; that is, they are alike. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/proverbs/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> the feet, <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> <i>and</i> drinketh damage.</span><p>(c) That is, of the messenger whom he sends.<p>(d) That is, receives damage by it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/proverbs/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">the feet</span>] Rather <span class="ital">his own</span> <span class="bld">feet</span>, R.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By choosing such a messenger he robs himself by his own act of the means of attaining his end, and suffers accordingly.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool.</span> This clause comes in the Hebrew after the next. <span class="cmt_word">Cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.</span> To entrust an important commission to a fool is to deprive one's self of the means of having it properly executed, and to bring upon one's self shame and injury. A man who is so silly as to employ such an unfit messenger, as it were, cuts off the feet which should bear him on his errand, and, instead of enjoying the satisfaction of seeing the business well performed, he will be mortified and damaged by the blunder and stupidity of his emissary. Septuagint, "He maketh for himself reproach from his own ways (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>,? <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) who sendeth a word by a foulish messenger." The Vulgate reads the first participle in a passive sense, <span class="accented">claudus pedibus</span>; but this is uneccessary. We have similar phrases to "drinketh damage" elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a> "drinketh in iniquity;" 34:7, "drinketh up scorn;" and with a different word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-28.htm">Proverbs 19:28</a>, "devoureth iniquity." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This verse, counselling restraint as to the spirit, is connected with the foregoing, which counsels to self-control as to enjoyment:<p>A city broken through, now without walls - <p>A man without self-control over his spirit.<p>A "city broken down" is one whose wall is "broken," <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>, whether it has met with breaches (&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;), or is wholly broken; in the former case also the city is incapable of being defended, and it is all one as if it had no wall. Such a city is like a man "who hath no control over his own spirit" (for the accentuation of the Heb. words here, vid., Thorath Emeth, p. 10): cujus spiritui nulla cohibitio (Schultens), i.e., qui animum suum cohibere non potest (Fleischer: &#1506;&#1510;&#1512;, R. &#1510;&#1512;, to press together, to oppress, and thereby to hold back). As such a city can be plundered and laid waste without trouble, so a man who knows not to hold in check his desires and affections is in constant danger of blindly following the impulse of his unbridled sensuality, and of being hurried forward to outbreaks of passion, and thus of bringing unhappiness upon himself. There are sensual passions (e.g., drunkenness), intellectual (e.g., ambition), mingled (e.g., revenge); but in all of these a false ego rules, which, instead of being held down by the true and better ego, rises to unbounded supremacy.<p>(Note: Vid., Drbal's Empirische Psychologie, 137.)<p>Therefore the expression used is not &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, but &#1500;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;; desire has its seat in the soul, but in the spirit it grows into passion, which in the root of all its diversities is selfishness (Psychol. p. 199); self-control is accordingly the ruling of the spirit, i.e., the restraining (keeping down) of the false enslaved ego-life by the true and free, and powerful in God Himself. </body></html>
