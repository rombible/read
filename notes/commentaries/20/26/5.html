He that is cursed without cause, the curse shall do him no more harm than the bird that flies over his head. 3. Every creature must be dealt with according to its nature, but careless and profligate sinners never will be ruled by reason and persuasion. Man indeed is born like the wild ass's colt; but some, by the grace of God, are changed. 4,5. We are to fit our remarks to the man, and address them to his conscience, so as may best end the debate. 6-9. Fools are not fit to be trusted, nor to have any honour. Wise sayings, as a foolish man delivers and applies them, lose their usefulness. 10. This verse may either declare how the Lord, the Creator of all men, will deal with sinners according to their guilt, or, how the powerful among men should disgrace and punish the wicked. 11. The dog is a loathsome emblem of those sinners who return to their vices, 2Pe 2:22. 12. We see many a one who has some little sense, but is proud of it. This describes those who think their spiritual state to be good, when really it is very bad. 13. The slothful man hates every thing that requires care and labour. But it is foolish to frighten ourselves from real duties by fancied difficulties. This may be applied to a man slothful in the duties of religion. 14. Having seen the slothful man in fear of his work, here we find him in love with his ease. Bodily ease is the sad occasion of many spiritual diseases. He does not care to get forward with his business. Slothful professors turn thus. The world and the flesh are hinges on which they are hung; and though they move in a course of outward services, yet they are not the nearer to heaven. 15. The sluggard is now out of his bed, but he might have lain there, for any thing he is likely to bring to pass in his work. It is common for men who will not do their duty, to pretend they cannot. Those that are slothful in religion, will not be at the pains to feed their souls with the bread of life, nor to fetch in promised blessings by prayer. 16. He that takes pains in religion, knows he is working for a good Master, and that his labour shall not be in vain. 17. To make ourselves busy in other men's matters, is to thrust ourselves into temptation. 18,19. He that sins in jest, must repent in earnest, or his sin will be his ruin. 20-22. Contention heats the spirit, and puts families and societies into a flame. And that fire is commonly kindled and kept burning by whisperers and backbiters. 23. A wicked heart disguising itself, is like a potsherd covered with the dross of silver.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Two sides of a truth. To "answer a fool according to his folly" is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-4.htm">Proverbs 26:4</a> to bandy words with him, to descend to his level of coarse anger and vile abuse; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-5.htm">Proverbs 26:5</a> it is to say the right word at the right time, to expose his unwisdom and untruth to others and to himself, not by a teaching beyond his reach, but by words that he is just able to apprehend. The apparent contradiction between the two verses led some of the rabbis to question the canonical authority of this book. The Pythagoreans had maxims expressing a truth in precepts seemingly contradictory. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/proverbs/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The Venet. translates 27b literally: &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769; &#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;; but what is the reference of this &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501;? Euchel and others refer it to men, for they translate: "to set a limit to the glory of man is true glory;" but the "glory of man" is denoted by the phrase &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, not by &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501;; and, besides, &#1495;&#1511;&#1512; does not mean measure and limit. Oetinger explains: "To eat too much honey is not good; whereas the searching after their glory, viz., of pleasant and praiseworthy things, which are likened to honey, is glory, cannot be too much done, and is never without utility and honour;" but how can &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501; be of the same meaning as &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; &#1492;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; or &#1492;&#1504;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; - such an abbreviation of the expression is impossible. Schultens, according to Rashi: vestigatio gravitatis eorum est gravitas, i.e., the searching out of their difficulty is a trouble; better Vitringa (since &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; nowhere occurs in this sense of gravitas molesta ac pondere oppressura): investigatio praestantiae eorum est gloriosa; but Vitringa, in order to gain a connection to 27a, needs to introduce etiamsi, and in both explanations the reference of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501; is imaginary, and it by no means lies near, since the Scripture uses the word &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; of God, and His kingdom and name, but never of His law or His revelation. Thus also is an argument against Bertheau, who translates: the searching out of their glory (viz., of the divine law and revelation) is a burden, a strenuous occupation of the mind, since &#1495;&#1511;&#1512; does not in itself mean searching out, and is equivocally, even unintelligibly, expressed, since &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; denotes, it is true, here and there, a great multitude, but never a burden (as &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;). The thought which Jerome finds in 27b: qui scrutator est majestatis opprimetur a gloria, is judicious, and connects itself synonym. with 27a; but such a thought is unwarranted, for he disregards the suff. of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501;, and renders &#1499;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; in the sense of difficulty (oppression). Or should it perhaps be vocalized &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501; (Syr., Targ., Theodotion, &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;  equals  &#1504;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;)? Thus vocalized, Umbreit renders it in the sense of honores; Elster and Zckler in the sense of difficultates (difficilia); but this plur., neither the biblical, nor, so far as I know, the post-bibl. usage of the word has ever adopted. However, the sense of the proverb which Elster and Zckler gain is certainly that which is aimed at. We accordingly translate:<p>To surfeit oneself in eating honey is not good,<p>But as an inquirer to enter on what is difficult is honour.<p>We read &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501; instead of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501;. This change commends itself far more than &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491; &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491; (&#1493;&#1495;&#1511;&#1512;), according to which Gesenius explains: nimium studium honoris est sine honore - impossible, for &#1495;&#1511;&#1512; does not signify nimium studium, in the sense of striving, but only that of inquiry: one strives after honour, but does not study it. Hitzig and Ewald, after the example of J. D. Michaelis, Arnoldi, and Ziegler, betake themselves therefore to the Arabic; Ewald explains, for he leaves the text unchanged: "To despise their honour (that is, of men) is honour (true, real honour);" Hitzig, for he changes the text like Gesenius: "To despise honour is more than honour," with the ingenious remark: To obtain an order [insigne ordinis] is an honour, but not to wear it then for the first time is its bouquet. Nowhere any trace either in Hebrew or in Aramaic is to be found of the verb &#1495;&#1511;&#1512;, to despise (to be despised), and so it must here remain without example.<p>(Note: The Hebrew meaning investigare, and the equivalent Arabic h&#803;ak&#803;r, contemnere (contemtui esse), are derivations from the primary meaning (R. &#1495;&#1511;): to go down from above firmly on anything, and thus to press in (to cut in), or also to press downward.)<p>Nor have we any need of it. The change of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501; into &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501; is enough. The proverb is an antithetic distich; 27a warns against inordinate longing after enjoyments, 27b praises earnest labour. Instead of &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, if honey in the mass were intended, the words would have been &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-10.htm">1 Kings 10:10</a>), or at least &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>); &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; can only be a n. actionis, and &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; its inverted object (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-4.htm">Jeremiah 9:4</a>), as Bttcher has discerned: to make much of the eating of honey, to do much therein is not good (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-16.htm">Proverbs 25:16</a>). In 27b Luther also partly hits on the correct rendering: "and he who searches into difficult things, to him it is too difficult," for which it ought to be said: to him it is an honour. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501;, viz., &#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, signifies difficult things, as &#1512;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/12-11.htm">Proverbs 12:11</a>, vain things. The Heb. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;, however, never means difficult to be understood or comprehended (although more modern lexicons say this),<p>(Note: Cf. Sir. 3:20f. with Ben-Sira's Heb. text in my Gesch. der jd. Poesie, p. 204 (vv. 30-32); nowhere does this adj. &#1499;&#1489;&#1491; appears here in this warning against meditating over the transcendental.)<p>but always only burdensome and heavy, gravis, not difficilis. &#1499;&#1489;&#1491;&#1501; are also things of which the &#1495;&#1511;&#1512;, i.e., the fundamental searching into them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-2.htm">Proverbs 25:2</a>.), costs an earnest effort, which perhaps, according to the first impression, appears to surpass the available strength (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-18.htm">Exodus 18:18</a>). To overdo oneself in eating honey is not good; on the contrary, the searching into difficult subjects is nothing less than an eating of honey, but an honour. There is here a paronomasia. Fleischer translates it: explorare gravia grave est; but we render grave est not in the sense of molestiam creat, but gravitatem parit (weight  equals  respect, honour). </body></html>
