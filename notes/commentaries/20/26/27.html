Always distrust when a man speaks fair unless you know him well. Satan, in his temptations, speaks fair, as he did to Eve; but it is madness to give credit to him. 27. What pains men take to do mischief to others! but it is digging a pit, it is rolling a stone, hard work; and they prepare mischief to themselves. 28. There are two sorts of lies equally detestable. A slandering lie, the mischief of this every body sees. A flattering lie, which secretly works ruin. A wise man will be more afraid of a flatterer than of a slanderer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/proverbs/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rolleth a stone - The illustration refers, probably, to the use made of stones in the rough warfare of an earlier age.

It is a metaphor from hunters, who used to dig deep pits, and then to cover them slightly with earth, that wild beasts passing that way might fall into them, and sometimes in the heat of pursuit fell into them themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That rolleth a stone, </span> to wit, up the hill, with design to do mischief to some person or thing with it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/proverbs/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein,.... That devises mischief against others, it shall come upon himself. The allusion is to the digging of pits for catching wild beasts, which are slightly covered with earth; and which sometimes the pursuers, through inadvertency, fall into themselves; the passage seems to be taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>; <p>and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him; that rolls a stone up hill, if he does not take care, it will return back, and fall with great force upon himself; so the mischief which a wicked man labours hard at, as men do in digging a pit, or rolling a stone, in time rolls back upon themselves; the measure they mete out to others is measured to them. Jarchi makes mention of an "hagadah", or exposition, which illustrates this passage, by the case of Abimelech; who slew threescore and ten persons on one stone, and was himself killed with a piece of a millstone cast upon him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-18.htm">Judges 9:18</a>; this may put in mind of the fable of Sisyphus (o), feigned in hell to roll a great stone to the top of a mountain, which presently falling down on his head, made his labour fruitless. <p>(o) "Aut petis aut urges ruitum, Sisyphe, saxum", Ovid.

St. Chrysostom speaks of the blindness of malice: "Let us not plot against others, lest we injure ourselves. When we supplant the reputation of others, let us consider that we injure ourselves, it is against ourselves that we plot. For perchance with men we do him harm, if we have power, but ourselves in the sight of God, by provoking him against us. Let us not, then, injure ourselves. For as we injure ourselves when we injure our neighbours, so by benefiting them we benefit ourselves" ('Hom. 14, in Phil.,' Oxford transl.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/proverbs/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21 Black coal to burning coal, and wood to fire;<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a contentious man to stir up strife.<p>The Venet. translates &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501; by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;, and &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1514; by &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;; the former (from &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;, Arab. fah&#803;uma, to be deep black) is coal in itself; the latter (from &#1490;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;, jaham, to set on fire, and intrans. to burn), coal in a glowing state (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-13.htm">Ezekiel 1:13</a>). Black coal is suited to glowing coal, to nourish it; and wood to the fire, to sustain it; and a contentious man is suited for and serves this purpose, to kindle up strife. &#1495;&#1512;&#1512; signifies to be hot, and the Pilpel &#1495;&#1512;&#1495;&#1512;, to heat, i.e., to make hot or hotter. The three - coal, wood, and the contentious man - are alike, in that they are a means to an end. </body></html>
