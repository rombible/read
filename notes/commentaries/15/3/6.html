They could not at once have a temple, but they would not be without an altar. Fear of danger should stir us to our duty. Have we many enemies? Then it is good to have God our Friend, and to keep up communion with him. Our fears should drive us to our knees. The sacrifices for all these solemnities were a heavy expense for so poor a company; yet besides those expressly appointed, many brought free-will offerings to the Lord. And they made preparation for the building of the temple without delay: whatever God calls us to do, we may depend upon his providence to furnish us with the needful means.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon his bases - They restored the old altar of burnt-offerings, which stood directly in front of the temple-porch, upon the old foundation.

Comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-70.htm">Nehemiah 7:70-73</a>. - Some of the heads of houses, when they came to the house of Jahve, i.e., arrived at the site of the temple, brought free-will offerings (&#1492;&#1514;&#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-5.htm">1 Chronicles 29:5</a>) to set it up in its place (&#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491;, to set up, i.e., to rebuild; identical in meaning both here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-9.htm">Ezra 9:9</a> with &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;). After their ability (&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1495;&#1501;; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>) they gave unto the treasure of the work, i.e., of restoring the temple and its services, 61,000 darics of gold  equals  68,625, and 5000 mina of silver, above 30,000, and 100 priests' garments. The account of these contributions is more accurately given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-70.htm">Nehemiah 7:70-72</a>, according to which some of the heads of houses gave unto the work (&#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1514; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a> and elsewhere); the Tirshatha gave to the treasure 1000 darics of gold, 50 sacrificial vessels (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>), 30 priests' garments, and 500 ... This last statement is defective; for the two <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30.htm">Numbers 30</a> and 500 must not be combined into 530, as in this case the hundreds would have stood first. The objects enumerated were named before 500, and are omitted through a clerical error, &#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1493;&#1499;&#1505;&#1507; "and silver (500) mina." And some of the heads of houses (others than the Tirshatha) gave of gold 20,000 darics, of silver, 2200 mina; and that which the rest of the people gave was-gold, 20,000 darics, silver, 2000 mina, and 67 priests' garments. According to this statement, the Tirshatha, the heads of houses, and the rest of the people, gave together 41,000 darics in gold, 4200 mina in silver, 97 priests' garments, and 30 golden vessels. In Ezra the vessels are omitted; and instead of the 30 + 67  equals  97 priests' garments, they are stated in round numbers to have been 100. The two other differences have arisen from textual errors. Instead of 61,000 darics, it is evident that we must read with Nehemiah, 41,000 (1000 + 20,000 + 20,000); and in addition to the 2200 and 2000 mina, reckon, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-70.htm">Nehemiah 7:70</a>, 500 more, in all 4700, for which in the text of Ezra we have the round sum of 5000. The account of the return of the first band of exiles concludes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-70.htm">Ezra 2:70</a>, and the narrative proceeds to the subsequent final statement: "So the priests, etc ... .dwelt in their cities." &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1503;, those of the people, are the men of the people of Israel of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>, the laity as distinguished from the priests, Levites, etc. In Nehemiah the words are transposed, so that &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; &#1502;&#1503; stand after the Levitical door-keepers and singers. Bertheau thinks this position more appropriate; but we cannot but judge otherwise. The placing of the people, i.e., the laity of Israel, between the consecrated servants of the temple (the priests and their Levitical assistants in the sacrificial service) and the singers and door-keepers, seems to us quite consistent; while, on the other hand, the naming of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; before the &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in Nehemiah seems inappropriate, because the performance of the choral service of the temple was a higher office than the guardianship of the doors. Neither can we regard Bertheau's view, that &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, which in the present verse follows &#1493;&#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, should be erased, as a correct one. The word forms a perfectly appropriate close to the sentence beginning with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;; and the sentence following, "And all Israel were in their cities," forms a well-rounded close to the account; while, on the contrary, the summing up of the different divisions by the words &#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; in Nehemiah, after the enumeration of those divisions, has a rather heavy effect.<p>(Note: In 1 Esdr. 5:46, this verse, freely carrying out the texts of Ezra and Nehemiah, with regard also to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-30</a>, runs thus: "And so dwelt the priests, and the Levites, and the people, in Jerusalem and in the country, the singers also and the porters, and all Israel in their villages.") </body></html>
