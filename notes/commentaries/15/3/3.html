(<span class="ital">a</span>) There is a difference of reading. The C’thib gives the singular, the K’ri the plural. The word occurs frequently in the plur. (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-17.htm" title="And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brazen oxen that were under it, and put it on the pavement of stones.">2 Kings 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-13.htm" title="And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.">2 Kings 25:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-19.htm" title="For thus said the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city.">Jeremiah 27:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-17.htm" title="Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 52:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-20.htm" title="The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.">Jeremiah 52:20</a>), it is probable that the singular has been altered into the more familiar plural usage. (<span class="ital">b</span>) The meaning of the word is much controverted. On the one hand it is supposed that having cleared away the rubbish and <span class="ital">débris</span> the leaders of the people came upon the old foundations or ‘base’ of the former altar and erected the new altar upon the spot. But the translation ‘upon its base’ scarcely admits of such latitude of interpretation; although the sentiment is most suitable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the other hand, if to ‘set upon its base’ merely means to erect, the term is unnecessarily ponderous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The translation of the R.V. margin ‘in its place’ seems to be the best. It is very probable that the word in the verse is identical with that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-68.htm" title="And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place:">Ezra 2:68</a>. The altar was set up in the place which it was permanently to occupy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for fear</span> was <span class="ital">upon them because of the people of</span> those <span class="ital">countries</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">the countries.</span> The condensed language of this clause in the original has occasioned much perplexity. Literally it runs ‘for in fear upon them because of &c.’. (i) Another rendering has been proposed ‘for they (set up the altar) in fear, which came upon them because of the people of the countries’, but this leaves the word ‘for’ unexplained and supposes a very awkward construction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(ii) The translation of the A.V. and R.V. cuts the grammatical knot contained in the words ‘in fear’ by translating them as the subject. Accepting this translation ‘for fear was upon them &c.’, a further question is raised by the motive of their action. The following answers have been given: (<span class="ital">a</span>) they set up the altar hoping to obtain thereby assistance from God, for they were in a state of fear: (<span class="ital">b</span>) they set up the altar in haste, for they feared the neighbouring peoples lest their interference at the court of Cyrus should check the work at its outset.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(iii) Quite a different turn to the verse is given by another rendering (? that of Ewald). ‘They set up the altar (and they were able to do so), for there was a fear felt toward them (the Jews) on the part of the people of the country’. This would be a fear such as we read of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-5.htm" title="And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.">Genesis 35:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-16.htm" title="Fear and dread shall fall on them; by the greatness of your arm they shall be as still as a stone; till your people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which you have purchased.">Exodus 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-11.htm" title="And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.">Joshua 2:11</a>. It is to be noticed that in the last two passages the same rather unusual word for terror is used as we find in this verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(iv) Supposing that there has been a corruption of the text, it has been suggested that some important words have fallen out and that we should read ‘And the people of the countries gathered themselves together against them, and they (the Jews) set up the altar in its place, for in a moment of terror at them did they set it up’. (Ryssel.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(v) The suggestion is here made that a very slight alteration—the omission of one letter (the preposition = ‘because of’)—will supply a good sense and remove the grammatical difficulty, i.e. ‘<span class="ital">for the people of the countries were a terror to them</span>’. The accidental repetition of this one letter has probably given rise to the whole difficulty. The meaning of the verse then will be ‘they set up the altar, for their neighbours were a source of terror to them,’ and the erection of the altar gave them religious confidence, it constituted a national rallying point; it was a beginning, and the success of the first movement might be decisive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the people of</span> those <span class="ital">countries</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">the people of the countries.</span> It is to be regretted that the R.V. has not here rendered this phrase (’ammê ha-arâçoth) by ‘the peoples of the lands’ as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/9-1.htm" title="Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites....">Ezra 9:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-11.htm" title="Which you have commanded by your servants the prophets, saying, The land, to which you go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.">Ezra 9:11</a>.

This was done, no doubt, to indicate that the religion which the exiles brought back from Babylon was in every respect identical with that which they had possessed before they were carried thither. Many moderns hold the contrary; but it has not yet been proved that the sojourn at Babylon modified the religious ideas of the Jews in any important particular. <span class="cmt_word">For fear was upon them.</span> Or, "<span class="accented">though</span> fear was upon them." Notwithstanding their fear of the surrounding nations, they set up the altar. We must remember that their neighbours were not Persians, but descendants of various idolatrous nations  -  Hamathites, Babylonians, Susianians, Elamites, Cuthaeans, etc. - bitterly opposed to anything like a pure spiritual religion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9, 10</a>). Though the exiles had permission from Cyrus to raise up not only their altar, but their temple, it was not at all certain that his nominal subjects would passively submit. It was as if a modern Turkish Sultan should decree the erection of a Christian altar and a grand Christian cathedral at Kerbela or Bussorah, towards the verge of his empire. There would be great danger in acting on such a decree. <span class="cmt_word">Burnt offerings morning and evening</span>.

CELEBRATION OF THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES (ver. 4). Emboldened by their successful restoration of the altar of burnt sacrifice, Zerubbabel and Jeshua allowed the people to gather themselves together and celebrate the autumnal festival, though they can scarcely have made it on this occasion a "feast of ingathering." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The numbers of the beasts, whether for riding or baggage: horses, 736; mules, 245; camels, 435; and asses, 6720.
