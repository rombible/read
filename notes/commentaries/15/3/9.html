Those that only knew the misery of having no temple at all, praised the Lord with shouts of joy. To them, even this foundation seemed great. We ought to be thankful for the beginnings of mercy, though it be not yet perfect. But those who remembered the glory of the first temple, and considered how far inferior this was likely to be, wept with a loud voice. There was reason for it, and if they bewailed the sin that was the cause of this melancholy change, they did well. Yet it was wrong to cast a damp upon the common joys. They despised the day of small things, and were unthankful for the good they enjoyed.

This <span class="bld">verse</span> presents considerable difficulty: (<span class="ital">a</span>) The English reader cannot fail to be struck with the awkwardness of the final clause, ‘the sons of Henadad … the Levites’. (<span class="ital">b</span>) The names here mentioned have been understood by different commentators to represent four, two and three families.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) The manifest dislocation of the verse has caused some to conjecture that it is a gloss, which has found its way into the text, having been originally introduced to supplement the previous verse by the names of those who had been appointed to the work and by emphasizing the fact that they undertook the duty. This conjecture, which is not without probability, would assign a very early date to the gloss, since the verse appears in the LXX. and, though in a corrupt form, in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/5-58.htm" title="And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over the works of the Lord. Then stood up Jesus, and his sons and brethren, and Cadmiel his brother, and the sons of Madiabun, with the sons of Joda the son of Eliadun, with their sons and brethren, all Levites, with one accord setters forward of the business, labouring to advance the works in the house of God. So the workmen built the temple of the Lord.">1Es 5:58</a>, ‘Then stood up Jesus, and his sons and brethren, and Cadmiel his brother and the sons of Madiabun, with the sons of Joda the son of Eliadun, with their sons and brethren, all Levites, with one accord, betters forward of the business, labouring to advance the works in the house of God’ (A.V.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If we dismiss this conjecture on the ground of its lack of external evidence, we must be prepared to treat the verse as having come down to us in some way corrupted or mutilated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The key to the verse lies in the last words, ‘the Levites’. The verse describes who the Levites were that received the commission (described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm" title="Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.">Ezra 3:8</a>), and how they discharged it. The student therefore will take care not to confound the Jeshua here mentioned with the Jeshua (the high-priest) mentioned in the previous verse. This Jeshua is the Levite whose name occurs in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-40.htm" title="The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four.">Ezra 2:40</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The natural arrangement of the words (illustrated by <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/5-58.htm" title="And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over the works of the Lord.

So the workmen built the temple of the Lord.">1Es 5:58</a> quoted above) would be, ‘Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, (<span class="ital">and</span>) the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brethren (i.e. <span class="ital">all</span>) the Levites together, to have the oversight of the workmen in the house of God.’ The verse thus specifies the Levites who undertook the oversight of the workmen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) The names of the Levitical families who returned appear in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-40.htm" title="The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four.">Ezra 2:40</a>, where there is some uncertainty whether the expression ‘of the children of Hodaviah’ refers to Kadmiel alone or to ‘the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel’ taken together.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ‘Judah’ of our verse is probably a misreading for Hodaviah, not, as some prefer, an alternative name of the same person.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) Some see in the verse a mention of <span class="ital">four</span> Levitical families, i.e. those of Jeshua, Kadmiel, Judah, and Henadad.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) Others think that only <span class="ital">two</span> are intended, i.e. those of Jeshua and Kadmiel, who are further defined as sons of Hodaviah (=Judah), and as sons of Henadad.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) It seems better to suppose that there are <span class="ital">three</span> families referred to: (i) ‘Jeshua with his sons and his brethren,’ apparently a complete family, (ii) ‘Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Hodaviah’, apparently a special branch of the family of Kadmiel, (iii) ‘And the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren’, who, though not mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-40.htm" title="The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four.">Ezra 2:40</a>, are represented in Nehemiah’s time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-18.htm" title="After him repaired their brothers, Bavai the son of Henadad, the ruler of the half part of Keilah.">Nehemiah 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-24.htm" title="After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah to the turning of the wall, even to the corner.">Nehemiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-9.htm" title="And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;">Nehemiah 10:9</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The absence of Henadad’s name from the list in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-40.htm" title="The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four.">Ezra 2:40</a> is strange. But we must account for it by supposing either that the Henadad family never left Palestine, or that they came to Jerusalem between the arrival of Zerubbabel and the beginning of the second year, or that they belonged to the class more numerous than scholars have hitherto taken account of, i.e. those who returned to Jerusalem from exile in other countries. Perhaps the family of Henadad (‘the grace or favour of Hadad’, cf. Hadad, Benhadad, Hadadrimmon) had Syrian connexions or had found refuge in Syria during the disasters of Israel and Judah. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-21.htm" title="And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,">Ezra 6:21</a>, ‘all such as had separated themselves from the filthiness of the heathen of the land’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jeshua</span> here is the head of the Levitical family mentioned in ch. 2:40 as "the children of Jeshua," and <span class="cmt_word">Kadmiel</span> is the head of the other family. Judah represents the "Hodaviah" of that place, and is probably a corrupt reading, as Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-43.htm">Nehemiah 7:43</a>) has "Hodevah." <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Henadad,</span> who are here united with the Jeshuites and Kadmielites, constitute a third Levitical family, which (as the text stands) was also engaged in superintending the work.

The feminine &#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; has here a like signification with the masculine form &#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-68.htm">Ezra 2:68</a>, and &#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a>. The Keri &#1502;&#1499;&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; is an incorrect revision. "For fear was upon them, because of the people of those countries." The &#1489; prefixed to &#1488;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; is the so-called &#1489; essentiae, expressing the being in a condition; properly, a being in fear had come or lay upon them. Comp. on &#1489; essentiae, Ewald, 217, f, and 299, b, though in 295, f, he seeks to interpret this passage differently. The "people of those countries" are the people dwelling in the neighbourhood of the new community; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-2.htm">Ezra 10:2</a>. The notion is: They erected the altar and restored the worship of Jahve, for the purpose of securing the divine protection, because fear of the surrounding heathen population had fallen upon them. J. H. Mich. had already a correct notion of the verse when he wrote: ut ita periculi metus eos ad Dei opem quaerendam impulerit.<p>(Note: Bertheau, on the contrary, cannot understand the meaning of this sentence, and endeavours, by an alteration of the text after 1 Esdras, to make it signify that some of the people of the countries came with the purpose of obstructing the building of the altar, but that the Israelites were able to effect the erection because a fear of God came upon the neighbouring nations, and rendered them incapable of hostile interference.)<p>Comp. the similar case in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25</a>., when the heathen colonists settled in the deserted cities of Samaria entreated the king of Assyria to send them a priest to teach them the manner of worshipping the God of the land, that thus they might be protected from the lions which infested it. The Chethiv &#1493;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500; must be taken impersonally: "one (they) offered;" but is perhaps only an error of transcription, and should be read &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;.
