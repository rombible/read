Ezra's address is a penitent confession of sin, the sin of his people. But let this be the comfort of true penitents, that though their sins reach to the heavens, God's mercy is in the heavens. Ezra, speaking of sin, speaks as one much ashamed. Holy shame is as necessary in true repentance as holy sorrow. Ezra speaks as much amazed. The discoveries of guilt cause amazement; the more we think of sin, the worse it looks. Say, God be merciful to me sinner. Ezra speaks as one much afraid. There is not a surer or saddler presage of ruin, than turning to sin, after great judgments, and great deliverances. Every one in the church of God, has to wonder that he has not wearied out the Lord's patience, and brought destruction upon himself. What then must be the case of the ungodly? But though the true penitent has nothing to plead in his own behalf, the heavenly Advocate pleads most powerfully for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Saying - The words which follow in this verse are not quoted from any previous book of Scripture, but merely give the general sense of numerous passages.

I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God&#8212;The burden of his prayer, which was dictated by a deep sense of the emergency, was that he was overwhelmed at the flagrant enormity of this sin, and the bold impiety of continuing in it after having, as a people, so recently experienced the heavy marks of the divine displeasure. God had begun to show returning favor to Israel by the restoration of some. But this only aggravated their sin, that, so soon after their re-establishment in their native land, they openly violated the express and repeated precepts which commanded them to extirpate the Canaanites. Such conduct, he exclaimed, could issue only in drawing down some great punishment from offended Heaven and ensuring the destruction of the small remnant of us that is left, unless, by the help of divine grace, we repent and bring forth the fruits of repentance in an immediate and thorough reformation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">An unclean land with the filthiness of the people:</span> this notes the cause or matter of this uncleanness.

There is no passage in the prophets resembling the words here given. It is generally supposed that Ezra is citing from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/7-1.htm" title="When the LORD your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you;...">Deuteronomy 7:1-3</a>, and that the expression ‘thy servants the prophets’ alludes to Moses. But it must be remembered that ‘the law of Moses’ in these books is always directly referred to, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-2.htm" title="Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.">Ezra 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-18.htm" title="And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.">Ezra 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm" title="This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God on him.">Ezra 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm" title="And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.">Nehemiah 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-14.htm" title="And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:">Nehemiah 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-1.htm" title="On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;">Nehemiah 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-18.htm" title="Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.">2 Chronicles 23:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-4.htm" title="But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.">2 Chronicles 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-16.htm" title="And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-12.htm" title="And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the oxen.">2 Chronicles 35:12</a>. It is better then to regard the passage as a perfectly general statement by Ezra of prophetical teaching upon the subject of intermarriage with foreign nations. Such a statement would naturally reecho the Deuteronomic law, and even repeat words and phrases which, by oral as well as by written tradition, would be familiar. We are forcibly reminded how much of the teaching of the prophets has never come down to us. On the other hand it is no less instructive to observe that the prophetical teaching seems naturally to embody itself in a form, which recalls the language of the Deuteronomic legislation, e.g. ‘The land unto which ye go to possess it’, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm" title="When the LORD your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you;">Deuteronomy 7:1</a> ‘Then the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The land</span> … is <span class="ital">an unclean land</span>] This expression (lit. land of unclean ness) is not found in the Pentateuch with reference to the promised land.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with the filthiness of the people of the land</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands.</span> The same word ‘uncleanness’ (niddah) is used here as in the phrase an ‘unclean land’. It occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-5.htm" title="And said to them, Hear me, you Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.">2 Chronicles 29:5</a> ‘carry forth the <span class="ital">filthiness</span> out of the holy place’. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-17.htm" title="Zion spreads forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD has commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.">Lamentations 1:17</a>. It is a strong word to denote anything that would convey defilement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with their abominations</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">through their abominations.</span> Added by way of explanation. On the word see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-1.htm" title="Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.">Ezra 9:1</a>. The ‘abominations’ are described as acts of impurity because these were the accompaniment of the local worship. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-27.htm" title="(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled;)">Leviticus 18:27</a> ‘All these abominations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/9-6.htm" title="And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up to the heavens....">Ezra 9:6-15</a>) have the men of the land done … and the land is defiled’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from one end to another</span>] Lit. ‘from mouth to mouth’. Cf. almost the same expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-21.htm" title="And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.">2 Kings 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm" title="Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.">2 Kings 21:16</a>. It means ‘from one extremity to another’; perhaps the metaphor has been taken from a drinking vessel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with their uncleanness</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">with their filthiness</span>. The same word in the Hebrew as that rendered ‘filthiness’ in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-21.htm" title="And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,">Ezra 6:21</a>. It denotes ‘impurity’, ‘defilement’ generally. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-2.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, said the LORD of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.">Zechariah 13:2</a> ‘I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land’. See, for the special application, the whole passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/18-24.htm" title="Defile not you yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:...">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is</span> <span class="cmt_word">an unclean land,</span> etc. These exact words do not occur elsewhere; but the "unclean" and corrupt character of the Canaanitish nations is constantly proclaimed in the Law, and was the sole reason why their land was taken from them and given to the Israelites. On the special character of their "filthiness" and "abominations" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-6.htm">Leviticus 18:6-27</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ezra's prayer and confession for the congregation. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5</a> And at the time of the evening sacrifice, I rose up from my mortification (&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, humiliation, generally through fasting, here through sitting motionless in deep affliction of soul), and rending my garment and my mantle. These words contribute a second particular to &#1511;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, and do not mean that Ezra arose with his garments torn, but state that, on arising, he rent his clothing, and therefore again manifested his sorrow in this manner. He then fell on his knees, and spread out his hands to God (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22</a>), to make a confession of the heavy guilt of the congregation before God, and thus impressively to set their sins before all who heard his prayer.</body></html>
