Ezra's address is a penitent confession of sin, the sin of his people. But let this be the comfort of true penitents, that though their sins reach to the heavens, God's mercy is in the heavens. Ezra, speaking of sin, speaks as one much ashamed. Holy shame is as necessary in true repentance as holy sorrow. Ezra speaks as much amazed. The discoveries of guilt cause amazement; the more we think of sin, the worse it looks. Say, God be merciful to me sinner. Ezra speaks as one much afraid. There is not a surer or saddler presage of ruin, than turning to sin, after great judgments, and great deliverances. Every one in the church of God, has to wonder that he has not wearied out the Lord's patience, and brought destruction upon himself. What then must be the case of the ungodly? But though the true penitent has nothing to plead in his own behalf, the heavenly Advocate pleads most powerfully for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "little space" was above 60 years, counting from the second year of Darius <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-24.htm">Ezra 4:24</a>, or about 80 years, counting from the first year of Cyrus <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>.

I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God&#8212;The burden of his prayer, which was dictated by a deep sense of the emergency, was that he was overwhelmed at the flagrant enormity of this sin, and the bold impiety of continuing in it after having, as a people, so recently experienced the heavy marks of the divine displeasure. God had begun to show returning favor to Israel by the restoration of some. But this only aggravated their sin, that, so soon after their re-establishment in their native land, they openly violated the express and repeated precepts which commanded them to extirpate the Canaanites. Such conduct, he exclaimed, could issue only in drawing down some great punishment from offended Heaven and ensuring the destruction of the small remnant of us that is left, unless, by the help of divine grace, we repent and bring forth the fruits of repentance in an immediate and thorough reformation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Now for a little space:</span> it is but a little while since God hath delivered and restored us, and yet we are already returned to our former sin and folly.

Or, <span class="ital">might not sue for favour</span>).

The writer makes use of a metaphor, which to us is a little obscure. The passage from Isaiah gives us the image of a nail or peg firmly fastened into a wall so that vessels could be hung from it securely. Others have derived the metaphor from camp life: upon the peg being driven into a firm soil depended the security of the tent. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm" title="Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations: spare not, lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes;">Isaiah 54:2</a> ‘lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes’ (or nails). In either case the nail is that which holds up or supports. Its power to do so, however strong the nail may be itself, depends upon the firmness of that into which it is driven.—‘The nail’ here is neither the Temple, as some have supposed, nor the princes and priests, but the community returned from Babylon established at Jerusalem. Upon this community depended the whole hopes of Israel. Ezra acknowledges the mercy which has permitted ‘the nail’ of the new Israel to be fixed once more in the place which God had chosen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in his holy place</span>] i.e. in Jerusalem, and at his Temple. The phrase occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-3.htm" title="Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?">Psalm 24:3</a> ‘Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place’? cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-13.htm" title="The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.">Isaiah 60:13</a>. That ‘holy place’ was the centre of the nation’s life, the witness to the Divine Presence. ‘The nail’ fixed there should bear any weight and resist all pressure; it was ‘the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, the mount Zion’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-7.htm" title="In that time shall the present be brought to the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning till now; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.">Isaiah 18:7</a>), ‘the place which the Lord shall choose’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-14.htm" title="But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do all that I command you.">Deuteronomy 12:14</a> passim), cf. ‘the holy mountain of my God’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-20.htm" title="And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;">Daniel 9:20</a> (16, 24), ‘the holy city’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-5.htm" title="Then the devil takes him up into the holy city, and sets him on a pinnacle of the temple,">Matthew 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-53.htm" title="And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many.">Matthew 27:53</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that our God may lighten our eyes</span>] The period of punishment had been one of night and gloom. The new gracious period of respite had brought daylight and brightness, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/13-3.htm" title="Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten my eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death;">Psalm 13:3</a> ‘Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and give us a little reviving in our bondage</span>] The restoration of the Jews had been a renewal of life (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/32-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,...">Ezekiel 32:1-14</a>) out of death. Ezra says ‘a little’; for (1) the period had been short, (2) they were still subject to foreign rulers. But it was a rekindling of the vital spark—a reviving. The Hebrew word is not very common, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-5.htm" title="Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold me here: for God did send me before you to preserve life.">Genesis 45:5</a> ‘God did send me before you to preserve life’ (lit. for reviving or the maintenance of life).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now for a little space grace hath been showed.</span> The "little space" must be understood <span class="accented">relatively</span> to the long enjoyment of Divine favour from Abraham to Zedekiah.

What now follows is placed in close chronological sequence with what precedes by the formula &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, at the time of the completion of these things; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-29.htm">2 Chronicles 29:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; are the things related <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-33.htm">Ezra 8:33-36</a>. Of these the delivery of the gifts took place on the fourth day after Ezra's arrival at Jerusalem, i.e., on the fourth or fifth day of the first month (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-32.htm">Ezra 8:32</a>, etc., with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>). The sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>) would undoubtedly be offered immediately; and the royal orders would be transmitted to the satraps and governors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-36.htm">Ezra 8:36</a>) very soon after. As soon, then, as Ezra received intelligence concerning the illegal marriages, he took the matter in hand, so that all related (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3-10</a>) occurred on one day. The first assemblage of the people with relation to this business was not, however, held till the twentieth day of the ninth month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-9.htm">Ezra 10:9</a>); while on the calling of this meeting, appearance thereat was prescribed within three days, thus leaving apparently an interval of nine whole months between <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8.htm">Ezra 8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1-15</a>. Hence Bertheau conjectures that the first proclamation of this assembly encountered opposition, because certain influential personages were averse to the further prosecution of this matter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-15.htm">Ezra 10:15</a>). But though <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-4.htm">Ezra 10:4-7</a> does not inform us what period elapsed between the adoption of Shecaniah's proposal to Ezra, and the proclamation for assembling the people at Jerusalem, the narrative does not give the impression that this proclamation was delayed for months through the opposition it met with. Besides, Ezra may have received the information concerning the unlawful marriages, not during the month of his arrival at Jerusalem, but some months later. We are not told whether it was given immediately, or soon after the completion of the matters mentioned <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-33.htm">Ezra 8:33-36</a>. The delivery of the royal commands to the satraps and governors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-36.htm">Ezra 8:36</a>) may have occupied weeks or months, the question being not merely to transmit the king's decrees to the said officials, but to come to such an understanding with them as might secure their favour and goodwill in assisting the newly established community, and supporting the house of God. The last sentence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-36.htm">Ezra 8:36</a>), "And they furthered the people and the house of God," plainly shows that such an understanding with the royal functionaries was effected, by transactions which must have preceded what is related <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1-15</a>.<p>This matter having been arranged, and Ezra being now about to enter upon the execution of his commission to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of his God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12</a>), he received information of the illegal marriages. While he was in the temple, the princes (&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, the princes, are those who give the information, the article being used e.g., like that in &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>) came to him, saying: The people (viz., Israel, the priests, and the Levites; the three classes of the Israelite community) do not separate themselves from the people of the lands; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-21.htm">Ezra 6:21</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1506;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, with respect to their abominations, i.e., as Israel should have done with respect to the abominations of these people. The &#1500; to &#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497; might be regarded as introducing the enumeration of the different nations, and corresponding with &#1502;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;; it is, however, more likely that it is used merely as a periphrasis for the genitive, and subordinates the names to &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;: their, i.e., the Canaanites', etc., abominations, the suffix relating, as e.g., at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a> and elsewhere, to the names following. Give Canaanitish races are here named, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-5.htm">Exodus 13:5</a>, with this difference, that the Perizzites are here substituted for the Hivites, while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23</a>, both are enumerated, making six; to these are added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a> the Girgashites, making, generally speaking, seven nations. Ammonites, Moabites, and Egyptians are here cited besides the Canaanitish races. The non-severance of the Israelites from these nations consisted, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a>, in the fact of their having contracted marriages with them. In the law, indeed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), only marriages with Canaanitish women were forbidden; but the reason of this prohibition, viz., that Israel might not be seduced by them to idolatry, made its extension to Moabites, Ammonites, and Egyptians necessary under existing circumstances, if an effectual check was to be put to the relapse into heathenism of the Israelitish community, now but just gathered out again from among the Gentiles. For during the captivity idolaters of all nations had settled in the depopulated country, and mingled with the remnant of the Israelites left there. By "the people of the lands," however, we are not to understand, with J. H. Michaelis, remnants of the races subjugated by Nebuchadnezzar and carried to Babylon, - who were now, after seventy years, returning, as well as the Jews, to their native lands under Cyrus; in support of which view Mich. incorrectly refers to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, etc. - but those portions, both of the ancient Canaanitish races and of the Moabites and Ammonites, who, escaping the sentence of captivity, remained in the land. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is naturally completed by &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; from the context; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-44.htm">Ezra 10:44</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, and other passages. The subject of &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is the collective &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;, the holy seed, i.e., the members of the nation called to holiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>). The appellation is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-13.htm">Isaiah 6:13</a>, where the remnant of the covenant people, preserved in the midst of judgments, and purified thereby, is called a holy seed. The second part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a> contains an explanatory accessory clause: and the hand of the princes and rulers hath been first in this unfaithfulness (&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>), i.e., the princes were the first to transgress; on the figurative expression, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-10.htm">Deuteronomy 13:10</a>. &#1505;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is an Old-Persian word naturalized in Hebrew, signifying commander, prefect; but its etymology is not as yet satisfactorily ascertained: see Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>. </body></html>
