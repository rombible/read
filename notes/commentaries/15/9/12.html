Ezra's address is a penitent confession of sin, the sin of his people. But let this be the comfort of true penitents, that though their sins reach to the heavens, God's mercy is in the heavens. Ezra, speaking of sin, speaks as one much ashamed. Holy shame is as necessary in true repentance as holy sorrow. Ezra speaks as much amazed. The discoveries of guilt cause amazement; the more we think of sin, the worse it looks. Say, God be merciful to me sinner. Ezra speaks as one much afraid. There is not a surer or saddler presage of ruin, than turning to sin, after great judgments, and great deliverances. Every one in the church of God, has to wonder that he has not wearied out the Lord's patience, and brought destruction upon himself. What then must be the case of the ungodly? But though the true penitent has nothing to plead in his own behalf, the heavenly Advocate pleads most powerfully for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Saying - The words which follow in this verse are not quoted from any previous book of Scripture, but merely give the general sense of numerous passages.

I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God&#8212;The burden of his prayer, which was dictated by a deep sense of the emergency, was that he was overwhelmed at the flagrant enormity of this sin, and the bold impiety of continuing in it after having, as a people, so recently experienced the heavy marks of the divine displeasure. God had begun to show returning favor to Israel by the restoration of some. But this only aggravated their sin, that, so soon after their re-establishment in their native land, they openly violated the express and repeated precepts which commanded them to extirpate the Canaanites. Such conduct, he exclaimed, could issue only in drawing down some great punishment from offended Heaven and ensuring the destruction of the small remnant of us that is left, unless, by the help of divine grace, we repent and bring forth the fruits of repentance in an immediate and thorough reformation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Nor seek their peace; </span> but root them out, as I have commanded you to do; which also they have abundantly deserved, both of mine and of your hands.

From the days of our fathers, God has sorely punished us for our sins by delivering us into the power of our enemies; but has now again turned His pity towards us, and revived us in the place of His sanctuary, through the favour of the king of Persia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-7.htm">Ezra 9:7</a>). But we have again transgressed His commands, with the keeping of which God has connected our possession of the good land given unto us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10</a>). Should we then, after God has spared us more than we through our trespasses have deserved, bring His wrath upon us, till we are wholly consumed? God is just; He has preserved us; but we stand before Him with heavy guilt upon us, such guilt that we cannot endure God's presence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>). Ezra does not pray for the pardon of their sin, for he desires only to bring the congregation to the knowledge of the greatness of their transgression, and so to invite them to do all that in them lies to atone for their guilt, and to appease God's wrath.<p>"I am ashamed, and am covered with shame, to lift up my face to Thee, my God." &#1493;&#1504;&#1499;&#1500;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; united, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-19.htm">Jeremiah 31:19</a>, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-16.htm">Isaiah 45:16</a>, and other passages. &#1504;&#1499;&#1500;&#1501;, to be covered with shame, is stronger than &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;. "For our iniquities are increased over our head," i.e., have grown above our head. &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, to or over the head. &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492; serves to enhance the meaning of &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-17.htm">1 Chronicles 23:17</a>.
