Ezra's address is a penitent confession of sin, the sin of his people. But let this be the comfort of true penitents, that though their sins reach to the heavens, God's mercy is in the heavens. Ezra, speaking of sin, speaks as one much ashamed. Holy shame is as necessary in true repentance as holy sorrow. Ezra speaks as much amazed. The discoveries of guilt cause amazement; the more we think of sin, the worse it looks. Say, God be merciful to me sinner. Ezra speaks as one much afraid. There is not a surer or saddler presage of ruin, than turning to sin, after great judgments, and great deliverances. Every one in the church of God, has to wonder that he has not wearied out the Lord's patience, and brought destruction upon himself. What then must be the case of the ungodly? But though the true penitent has nothing to plead in his own behalf, the heavenly Advocate pleads most powerfully for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We were bondmen - Rather, "we are bondmen" (compare the marginal reference).

I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the Lord my God&#8212;The burden of his prayer, which was dictated by a deep sense of the emergency, was that he was overwhelmed at the flagrant enormity of this sin, and the bold impiety of continuing in it after having, as a people, so recently experienced the heavy marks of the divine displeasure. God had begun to show returning favor to Israel by the restoration of some. But this only aggravated their sin, that, so soon after their re-establishment in their native land, they openly violated the express and repeated precepts which commanded them to extirpate the Canaanites. Such conduct, he exclaimed, could issue only in drawing down some great punishment from offended Heaven and ensuring the destruction of the small remnant of us that is left, unless, by the help of divine grace, we repent and bring forth the fruits of repentance in an immediate and thorough reformation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">We were bondmen, </span> i.e. in greater bondage than that in which we now are. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, </span> i.e. hath given us to find favour in their eyes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To give us a reviving; </span> to recover us from the grave of dreadful calamities, in which we lay like dead men and dry bones, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-1.htm" title="The hand of the LORD was on me, and carried me out in the spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the middle of the valley which was full of bones,">Ezekiel 37:1</a></span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To repair the desolations thereof, </span> to wit, of the temple; either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The bondage is not past. The Jews are still bondmen, in servitude to the king of Persia.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">yet our God</span>, &c.] The hand of God’s mercy could be discerned in the events of past history.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">extended mercy</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-28.htm" title="And has extended mercy to me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes.

Here where the word is applied to the house and is found in connexion with the ‘repair’ (lit. ‘cause to stand’ or ‘set up’ as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-1.htm" title="Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had not set up the doors on the gates;)">Nehemiah 6:1</a>) ‘ruins’ seems the best English equivalent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a wall</span>] So also R.V. text. R.V. marg. ‘a fence’. The Hebrew word (‘gâdêr’) is specially used of a fence round a vineyard. It is used by Isaiah ‘I will break down the fence thereof’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-5.htm" title="And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:">Isaiah 5:5</a>) in the celebrated allegory in which Israel is the vineyard. It occurs also in the Psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-12.htm" title="Why have you then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?">Psalm 80:12</a>) ‘Why hast thou broken down her fences?’, where the same image of the sacred vine is employed. The use of the word here is perhaps an allusion to these well-known passages. It is not a literal ‘fence’ or ‘wall’, but ‘protection’ and ‘defence’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Judah and in Jerusalem</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm" title="Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and came again to Jerusalem and Judah, every one to his city;">Ezra 2:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-6.htm" title="And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.">Ezra 4:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-1.htm" title="Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them.">Ezra 5:1</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we</span> <span class="cmt_word">were bondsmen.</span> Rather, "we <span class="accented">are."</span> The Jews had not recovered their independence.
