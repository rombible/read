The Hebrew text gives Shechaniah as the house, but fails to give the name of its representative. ‘Shecaniah’ does not occur in the other lists as the name of a house. The text of 1 Esdr. has ‘of the sons of Zathoe, Shechenias the son of Jezelus’ (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/8-32.htm" title="Of the sons of Zathoe, Sechenias the son of Jezelus, and with him three hundred men: of the sons of Adin, Obeth the son of Jonathan, and with him two hundred and fifty men:">1Es 8:32</a>). ‘Zathoe’ is the same as Zattu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-8.htm" title="The children of Zattu, nine hundred forty and five.">Ezra 2:8</a>). This name has most probably accidentally dropped out. We should therefore read “Of the sons of Zattu, Shechaniah the son of Jahaziel’, i.e. Shechaniah is the representative of the house of Zattu: so also the LXX.

The Septuagint has, "Of the sons of Zattu, Shechaniah, the son of Jahaziel." Zattu is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-8.htm">Ezra 2:8</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This royal commission granted to the Jews all they could possibly desire from the heathen governors of the country, for the establishment and furtherance of their civil and religious polity. By granting these privileges, Artaxerxes was not only treading in the footsteps of Cyrus and Darius Hystaspes, but even going beyond these princes in granting to the Jews a jurisdiction of their own. Without a magistrate who was one of themselves, the Jewish community could not well prosper in their own land; for the social and religious life of Israel were so closely connected, that heathen magistrates, however well-intentioned, were incapable of exercising a beneficial influence upon the welfare of the Jews. Hence Ezra, having thus reported the royal commission, adds a thanksgiving to God for having put such a thing into the king's heart, namely, to beautify the house of the Lord, and for having granted him favour before the king and his counsellors. The sentence &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1493;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497; &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; e is a continuation of the preceding infinitive sentence in the tempus finit. &#1500; before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497; is the &#1500; comprehensive. Ezra names the beautifying of the house of God as the occasion of his thanksgiving, not only because this formed the chief matter of the royal favour, but also because the re-establishment of divine worship was the re-establishment of the moral and religious life of the community. "And I felt myself strengthened, and gathered together (so that I gathered together) the heads of Israel to go up with me (to Jerusalem)." Ezra assembled the heads, i.e., of houses, as fellow-travellers, because their decision would be a rule for the families at the head of which they stood. With their heads, the several races and families determined to return to the land of their fathers. </body></html>
