The deputation was despatched to Iddo, who was a prince or chief of the Nethinims&#8212;for the Persian government allowed the Hebrews during their exile to retain their ecclesiastical government by their own chiefs, as well as to enjoy the privilege of free worship. Iddo's influence procured and brought to the camp at Ahava thirty-eight Levites, and two hundred twenty Nethinims, the descendants of the Gibeonites, who performed the servile duties of the temple.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari,....

This reason, however, is not conclusive; for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-13.htm">Ezra 8:13</a> the further statement also differs, both in form and matter, from those in the former verses. Here, instead of the name of the head of the house, we read the words "last, and these their names;" whereupon three names are given, and not till then &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, "and with them sixty males." Here, then, it is not the head of the house who is named, but in his place three heads of families, amounting together to sixty males. Now, as these three families did not form a house, these sixty sons of Adonikam who returned with Ezra are, with regard to the six hundred and sixty-six sons of Adonikam who returned with Zerubbabel, designated the last, or last arrived, and thus comprised with them as one house.</body></html>
