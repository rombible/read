The fact that we find in the following clause “And Sherebiah”, &c. favours the supposition that we ought to have the name of the individual mentioned who was “of the sons of Mahli”. Either, as is most probable, this proper name has dropped out of the text before the words “a man of discretion”, or as is possible ‘Ish-sechel’ (LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἀνὴρ Σαχὼν</span>) is a proper name (cf. Ishbosheth, Ish-tob, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-6.htm" title="And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.">2 Samuel 10:6</a>; Ish-hod, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-18.htm" title="And his sister Hammoleketh bore Ishod, and Abiezer, and Mahalah.">1 Chronicles 7:18</a>). But such names are rare, and the name Ish-sechel does not occur elsewhere.

In ten cases the names of the races, which are uniformly introduced with &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, are identical in both texts, viz., Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Adin, Elam, Shephatiah, Joab, Bebai, Azgad, Adonikam, and Bigvai. On the other hand, it appears surprising, 1st, that in the first house mentioned, before the name &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, besides "of the sons of Parosh," we have also &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-3.htm">Ezra 8:3</a>), while before all the other names we find only "of the sons of" one individual; 2ndly, that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-5.htm">Ezra 8:5</a>, after &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, instead of a name of the head of a house, only Ben Jahaziel follows; 3rdly, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-10.htm">Ezra 8:10</a> also, after &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, we have merely Ben Josiphiah, the names themselves being apparently omitted in these two last cases.

It is more difficult to decide concerning &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-3.htm">Ezra 8:3</a>, though undoubtedly we have here too a corruption of the text. For, first, there is no other instance in the whole list of the sons of two men being cited before the proper name of the house; and then, too, the absence of the &#1493; copulative before &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1508; is opposed to the notion that the house of Zechariah was formed by a union of the sons of Shecaniah and Parosh, since in this case the and could not be omitted. It is true that we have in the lxx &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3a6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; but in this case the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; is certainly derived from the translator, who was thus seeking to make sense of the words. In 1 Esdr. 8 we read &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;; and &#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; corresponding with &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, the words &#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; (or &#1489;&#1503;) are taken into the preceding verse. This treatment of the words Bertheau considers correct, because Hattush in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a> is reckoned among the descendants of Shecaniah. This conjecture is, however, a very doubtful one. For, first, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a> Hattush is said to be of the sons of Shemaiah, and Shemaiah of the sons of Shecaniah; then we should as little expect any further statement in the case of Hattush as in the cases of Daniel and Gershom; and further, if he had been thus more precisely designated by naming his father, we should undoubtedly read &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;, not &#1513;&#1473; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, and thus the Masoretic text would at any rate be incorrect; and finally, 1 Esdras, where it differs from the lxx, is, generally speaking, no critical authority upon which to base safe conclusions. Under these circumstances, we must give up the hope of restoring the original text, and explaining the words &#1502;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;. &#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, "and with Zechariah, his genealogy of 150 males," i.e., with him his race, consisting of 150 males, registered in the genealogy of the race. In the case of the names which follow, the number only is given after the briefer expression &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;.<p>A review, then, of the twelve races, according to the restoration of the original text in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-5.htm">Ezra 8:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-10.htm">Ezra 8:10</a>, presents us with names already occurring in the list of the races who came from Babylon with Zerubbabel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3-15</a>, with the exception of the sons of Joab, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-9.htm">Ezra 8:9</a>, who are wanting in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, where, on the other hand, several other races are enumerated. Bertheau seeks to identify the sons of Joab, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-9.htm">Ezra 8:9</a>, with the sons of Joab who in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-6.htm">Ezra 2:6</a> are reckoned with the sons of Pahath-Moab, and to explain their special enumeration in the present list, by the conjecture that the one house subsequently separated into the two houses of Pahath-Moab and Joab, This is, indeed, possible; but it is quite a probable that only one portion or branch of the sons (descendants) of Joab was combined with the race of the sons of Pahath-Moab, and that the rest of the bne Joab formed a separate house, no family of which returned with Zerubbabel. The occurrence of the other races in both lists is to be explained by the circumstance that portions of them returned with Zerubbabel, and that the rest did not follow till Ezra's departure.</body></html>
