The R.V. margin adds, In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-24.htm" title="And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.">Nehemiah 12:24</a>, <span class="ital">Levites</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Sherebiah, Hashabiah</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">even Sherebiah, Hashabiah</span>.

The preposition which in the original stands before ‘Sherebiah’ is then treated (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-16.htm" title="Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding.">Ezra 8:16</a>) as the sign of the object. The objection to this is that Sherebiah and Hashabiah seem to have been Levites.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) The LXX. translates the preposition as the sign of the dative, “And I assigned of the chiefs of the priests twelve unto Sherebiah, &c.” (<span class="greekheb">καὶ διέστειλα</span> … <span class="greekheb">τῷ Σαραΐᾳ</span>). The objection to be made to this rendering is that it represents the priests as placed in a subordinate position to those who were Levites.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/8-54.htm" title="Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Esebrias, and Assanias, and ten men of their brethren with them:">1Es 8:54</a> and Eresibia (<span class="greekheb">καὶ Ἐρεσιβίαν</span>) suggests another reading (<span class="greekheb">ו</span> for <span class="greekheb">ל</span>), “And I separated … twelve and Sherebiah, &c.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">d</span>) The same result is obtained by the rendering of the R.V. margin, which is to be preferred, “I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests, <span class="ital">besides</span> Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brethren with them”, i.e. 12 priests <span class="ital">in addition to</span> 12 Levites (Sherebiah, Hashabiah and their 10 brethren). Accepting this rendering, we see that Ezra selected two groups of twelve, one of priests, the other of Levites, to act as guardians of the treasure, which agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-30.htm" title="So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.">Ezra 8:30</a>. The names of Sherebiah and Hashabiah are for some reason specially mentioned, either being the best known of the twenty-four, or perhaps alone recorded in the chronicle employed by the compiler. The only other explanation possible, that of the R.V. text, is that Sherebiah and Hashabiah were two of ‘the chiefs of the priests’ and not to be identified with the Levites of the same name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-24.htm" title="And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers over against them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God, ward over against ward.">Nehemiah 12:24</a>. This gives a satisfactory meaning, according to which Ezra selected twelve ‘chiefs of priests’ to act as custodians. But (1) the clause ‘and ten of their brethren with them’, after the previous mention of the ‘twelve’, rather denotes a second group of the same number: (2) it is expressly stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-30.htm" title="So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.">Ezra 8:30</a>, ‘the priests <span class="ital">and the Levites</span> received the weight of the silver, &c.’, while according to the R.V. text the Levites were not of the number.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah,</span> etc. Our translators, following the Vulgate, have omitted to render the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>, which occurs in the Hebrew text before the name of Sherebiah, and have thus represented Sherebiah and Hashabiah as priests, whereas they were not priests, but Levites, as appears from vers. 18, 19. The true sense is given by the LXX. - "Then I assigned twelve of the chief priests to Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "then I appointed twelve chief priests to act with twelve chief Levites, of whom Sherebiah and Hashabiah were two, in the matter of the royal offering." Ezra seems to have considered, that as the gift of Artaxerxes was an offering to the house of God, it ought to be handed over at once to the custody of the ministers of religion, and not remain in secular hands (compare ver. 28). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The delegates sent to Iddo succeeded, through the gracious assistance of God (&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>), in inducing forty Levites, and two hundred and twenty Nethinim, by means of Iddo's influence, to join their fellow-countrymen in their journey to Jerusalem.
