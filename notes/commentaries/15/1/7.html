The temptation was to some to stay in Babylon; but some feared not to return, and they were those whose spirits God raised, by his Spirit and grace. Whatever good we do, is owing to the grace of God. Our spirits naturally bow down to this earth and the things of it; if they move upward in any good affections or good actions, it is God who raises them. The calls and offers of the gospel are like the proclamation of Cyrus. Those bound under the power of sin, may be made free by Jesus Christ. Whosoever will, by repentance and faith, return to God, Jesus Christ has opened the way for him, and raises him out of the slavery of sin into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Many that hear this joyful sound, choose to sit still in Babylon, are in love with their sins, and will not venture upon a holy life; but some break through all discouragements, whatever it cost them; they are those whose spirit God has raised above the world and the flesh, whom he has made willing. Thus will the heavenly Canaan be filled, though many perish in Babylon; and the gospel offer will not have been made in vain. The bringing back the Jews from captivity, represents the redemption of sinners by Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The house of his gods - Rather, "of his god" <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>, i. e., Merodach, "his lord" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-7.htm">2 Chronicles 36:7</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ezr 1:7-11.

And these vessels, when they were taken away from the temple, might very well be said to be cut off from it, because they had for so long time been so constantly, and as it were inseparably, united to it, and kept in it.

And it is very improbable that they should deface and cut in pieces these magnificent vessels, which they could so easily transport whole to Babylon. Although, if some of the larger of them had been cut into two or more parts, yet the parts of them might be delivered to the Jews, who could, without great difficulty, restore them to their former unity and form. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the house of the Lord,....

It may be noticed that in the original the expression ‘carried out’ in the passage just cited and so translated in A.V. and R.V. is identical with the ‘brought forth’ in this verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>At the final destruction of Jerusalem (586) eleven or twelve years later, by Nebuzaradan, Nebuchadnezzar’s general, the remainder of the valuables contained in the house of the Lord were ‘taken away’ to Babylon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/25-14.htm" title="And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, took they away....">2 Kings 25:14-15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/1-1.htm" title="In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it....">Daniel 1:1-2</a>, which attributes to the third year (606) of Jehoiakim’s reign a siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, the capture of Jehoiakim, and the removal to Babylon of some of the sacred vessels, is chronologically incorrect. (1) The victory of Carchemish on the Euphrates was not won by Nebuchadnezzar till the fourth year of Jehoiakim (605). (2) According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm" title="In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.">2 Kings 24:1</a> Jehoiakim, who had been tributary to the king of Egypt, did not become tributary to Nebuchadnezzar until after that battle, and, having remained so for three years only, then rebelled. This rebellion led to Nebuchadnezzar’s siege and capture of Jerusalem in Jehoiachin’s brief reign of three months. All that can be said is that we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/1-1.htm" title="In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it....">Daniel 1:1-2</a>, a certain chronological error, but that it is conceivable that when Nebuchadnezzar ‘came up’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm" title="In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him.">2 Kings 24:1</a>) and Jehoiakim submitted, a siege may have preceded capitulation, and a carrying off to Babylon both of prisoners and of some vessels of the Lord may have taken place in 602 or 601. Of this we have no certain confirmation, and it is more probable that the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm" title="In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.">Daniel 1:1</a> may be a heading containing inaccurate historical statements or late tradition prefixed by a scribe to the narrative of Daniel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the house of his gods</span>] So A.V. and R.V. The original is ‘in the house of his Elohim’. ‘Elohim’ may be rendered either as ‘God’ or ‘gods’ according as the context requires. The student will observe that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm" title="And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.">Daniel 1:2</a> the same phrase ‘the house of his Elohim’ is rendered both by A.V. and R.V. ‘the house of his god’. Nebuchadnezzar was a polytheist. But had the stress here rested upon the plurality of his gods, we should have expected ‘in the houses of his gods’. The rendering ‘in the house of his god’ appears preferable, both on account of the singular ‘house’ and, especially, on account of Nebuchadnezzar’s devotion to one god, Merodach, to whom he paid greater honour than to any of the other deities of the Babylonian pantheon. The Temple of E-sagila in honour of Merodach was restored by Nebuchadnezzar with unrivalled splendour. The passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-7.htm" title="Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.">2 Chronicles 36:7</a> ‘Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the Lord to Babylon and put them in his temple at Babylon’, helps to confirm the rendering ‘in the house of his god’. The other passages relating to the sacred vessels are <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-16.htm" title="Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus said the LORD; Listen not to the words of your prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie to you.">Jeremiah 27:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-6.htm" title="Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform your words which you have prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD's house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place.">Jeremiah 28:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-18.htm" title="The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, took they away.">Jeremiah 52:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-23.htm" title="But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you, and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine in them; and you have praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, have you not glorified:">Daniel 5:23</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/baruch/1-8.htm" title="At the same time when he received the vessels of the house of the Lord, that were carried out of the temple, to return them into the land of Juda, the tenth day of the month Sivan, namely, silver vessels, which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Jada had made,">Bar 1:8</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The vessels</span>. Probably all that he could find, yet scarcely all that had been taken away, since many of these were of bronze (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-14.htm">2 Kings 25:14</a>), and the restored vessels seem to have been, all of them, either of gold or silver (see ver. 11). Which <span class="cmt_word">Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth. </span>The carrying off of sacred vessels, as well as images, from temples is often represented in the Assyrian sculptures.

Nebuchadnezzar represents himself, in his inscriptions generally, as a special devotee of a single Babylonian god, Merodach, whose temple, called by the Greeks that of Bel, is no doubt here intended (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the first year of his rule over Babylon, Cyrus king of Persia proclaimed throughout his whole kingdom, both by voice and writing, that the God of heaven had commanded him to build His temple at Jerusalem, and called upon the Jews living in exile to return to Jerusalem, and to build there the house of the God of Israel. At the same time, he exhorted all his subjects to facilitate by gifts the journey of the Jews dwelling in their midst, and to assist by free-will offerings the building of the temple (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-4</a>). In consequence of this royal decree, those Jews whose spirit God had raised up prepared for their return, and received from their neighbours gifts and free-will offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-6.htm">Ezra 1:6</a>).

The first year of Cyrus is the first year of his rule over Babylon and the Babylonian empire.<p>(Note: Duplex fuit initium, Cyri Persarum regis; prius Persicum, idque antiquius, posterius Babylonicum. de quo Hesdras; quia dum Cyrus in Perside tantum regnaret, regnum ejus ad Judaeos, qui in Babylonia erant, nihil adtinuit. - Cleric. ad Esr. 1:1.)<p>&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1505; - in the better editions, such as that of Norzi and J.

Here, however, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is more appropriate, because the notion of the lapse or termination of the seventy years predominates. The statement of the prophet Jeremiah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>, etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>) concerning the desolation and servitude of Judah is here intended. These seventy years commenced with the first taking of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, when Daniel and other youths of the seed-royal were carried to Babylon (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1-2</a>) in the fourth year of King Jehoiakim; see the explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a>. This year was the year 606 b.c.; hence the seventy years terminate in 536 b.c., the first year of the sole rule of Cyrus over the Babylonian empire. Then "Jahve stirred up the spirit of Coresh," i.e., moved him, made him willing; comp. with this expression, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1470;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;, "he caused a voice to go forth," i.e., he proclaimed by heralds; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/36-6.htm">Exodus 36:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-5.htm">2 Chronicles 30:5</a>, etc. With this is zeugmatically combined the subsequent &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489; &#1493;&#1490;&#1501;, so that the general notion of proclaiming has to be taken from &#1497;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1511;&#1493;&#1500;, and supplied before these words.
