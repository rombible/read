The following paraphrase will give the meaning. ‘In any place where survivors of the Jewish captivity are to be found sojourning, there let the natives of the place, the non-Israelite neighbours, render him all assistance.’ That this is the right interpretation is shown by the passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-2.htm" title="That Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.">Nehemiah 1:2</a>, ‘The Jews that had escaped, which <span class="ital">were left</span> of the captivity’ and <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-3.htm" title="Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do you see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?">Haggai 2:3</a>, ‘Who <span class="ital">is left</span> among you that saw this house in its former glory’. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-22.htm" title="And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.">2 Kings 25:22</a> and ‘the residue’ (R.V.) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-3.htm" title="And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places where I have driven them, said the LORD of hosts.">Jeremiah 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-8.htm" title="And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus said the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:">Jeremiah 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm" title="Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.">Jeremiah 39:9</a>, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The A.V. gives no intelligible sense. The R.V. (1) by altering ‘remaineth’ to ‘is left’ preserves the application of the word in the original to the survivors of the Captivity, (2) by punctuation indicates the construction of the verse, in which ‘whosoever is left’ is placed independently as a heading to the whole sentence; while the words ‘in any place where he sojourneth’ do not belong to ‘whosoever is left’ but introduce the succeeding clause ‘let the men &c.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage is somewhat awkwardly worded, but with the above explanation is rendered quite clear in meaning. The decree made no universal requisition for aid to the Jews. It only enjoined that local assistance should be given by neighbours, wherever any resident Jew availed himself of the king’s edict for the Return.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sojourneth</span>] The word in the original regularly used in the sense of ‘to dwell as a stranger’. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-34.htm" title="But the stranger that dwells with you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 19:34</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">help</span>] The A.V. margin has ‘Heb. lift him up’. The word in the original is the intensive Mood of the verb ‘to lift or carry’, and occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm" title="(Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.">1 Kings 9:11</a> = ‘furnished’. The LXX. (<span class="greekheb">ἀντιλαμβανέσθωσαν αὐτοῦ</span>) renders the sense well by the Greek word so familiar to English readers in the words ‘He hath holpen Israel his servant’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-54.htm" title="He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;">Luke 1:54</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts</span>] The assistance should be given in money for the journey, in necessaries for the new homes, and in means of transport.—“Goods” a vague word, reproducing the indefiniteness of the original. It occurs again <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-21.htm" title="Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.">Ezra 8:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-8.htm" title="And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.">Ezra 10:8</a>, = ‘substance’ in A.V. and R.V. (LXX. <span class="greekheb">κτῆσις</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὕπαρξις</span>, Vulgate ‘substantia’). Here the LXX. has <span class="greekheb">ἀποσκευή</span> and the Vulgate ‘substantia’. From its use in these passages and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-5.htm" title="And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.">Genesis 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-6.htm" title="And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.">Genesis 13:6</a>, we gather that the word means the moveables of a household. ‘Beasts’ i.e. beasts of burden—horses, camels and asses. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/2-66.htm" title="Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two hundred forty and five;...">Ezra 2:66-67</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">besides the freewill offering</span>] ‘beside’, i.e. along with (Vulg. wrongly ‘excepto quod’) certain voluntary gifts of a more private nature especially intended for the Temple, as in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-25.htm" title="And weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had offered:">Ezra 8:25</a>. Compare the freewill-offerings mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-29.htm" title="The children of Israel brought a willing offering to the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.">Exodus 35:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-23.htm" title="Either a bullock or a lamb that has any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that may you offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.">Leviticus 22:23</a>. This freewill offering is not to be restricted, as by some commentators, to the gifts either of Cyrus or of the Jews who remained behind. Any one, Jew or Gentile, could make such offerings, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-5.htm" title="And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering to the LORD.">Ezra 3:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the house of God</span>] These words denote the object of the free-will offering: and are not, as the Hebrew accents interpret, to be taken as following after ‘help him’, the intervening words being taken parenthetically.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that</span> is <span class="ital">in Jerusalem</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">which is,</span> consistently with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/1-2.htm" title="Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah....">Ezra 1:2-3</a>. The clause refers to ‘the house’. Some understand ‘God’ as the antecedent to ‘which’; but see note on a similar interpretation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-3.htm" title="Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:3</a>. The expression is in its explicitness similar to ‘Jerusalem which is in Judah’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm" title="Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.">Ezra 1:2</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever remaineth in any</span> <span class="cmt_word">place where he sojourneth.</span> Literally correct; but the meaning is, "And with regard to all those who remain (of the captive people) in any part of the country where they have their temporary abode, let the men of his district help him with silver," etc. Cyrus finishes his decree by calling upon his heathen subjects to come to the aid of the poorer Israelites, and assist them with money, cattle, and other commodities, in order that none may be hindered by poverty, or by the want of beasts of burthen, from joining the band of emigrants, and setting out on their return to Jerusalem. Again, the kindliness of his disposition is apparent. <span class="cmt_word">Beside the freewill offering</span>. So the Septuagint; but the Vulgate has, "<span class="accented">Except</span> the freewill offering," etc. The Septuagint and the A. V. are right. Cyrus means that money, cattle, and goods are to be made over to the poorer Israelites, <span class="accented">in addition</span> to any offering that might be intrusted to them for conveyance to Jerusalem, either by himself or by his subjects. Individually, he was about to send "a freewill offering," consisting of a number of gold and silver vessels for the service of the temple. His words suggest that his subjects might follow this good example. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_chronicles/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>He who remained from the sword, i.e., who had not been slain by the sword, had not fallen and died in war, Nebuchadnezzar carried away to Babylon into captivity; so that they became servants to him and to his sons, as Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7</a>) prophesied, until the rise of the kingdom of the Persians. These last words also are an historical interpretation of the prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7</a>. All this was done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>) to fulfil (&#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; instead of &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-5.htm">1 Chronicles 29:5</a>), that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, he having prophesied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-10.htm">2 Chronicles 29:10</a>) the seventy years' duration of Judah's desolation and the Babylonian captivity, while the king and people had not regarded his words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-12.htm">2 Chronicles 36:12</a>). This period, which according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-20.htm">2 Chronicles 36:20</a> came to an end with the rise of the kingdom of the Persians, is characterized by the clause &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1512;&#1510;&#1514;&#1492; &#1506;&#1491; as a time of expiation of the wrong which had been done the land by the non-observance of the sabbath-years, upon the basis of the threatening (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a>), in which the wasting of the land during the dispersion of the unrepentant people among the heathen was represented as a compensation for the neglected sabbaths. From this passage in the law the words are taken, to show how the Lord had inflicted the punishment with which the disobedient people had been threatened as early as in the time of Moses. &#1512;&#1510;&#1514;&#1492; &#1506;&#1491; is not to be translated, "until the land had made up its years of rest;" that signification &#1512;&#1510;&#1492; has not; but, "until the land had enjoyed its sabbath-years," i.e., until it had enjoyed the rest of which it had been deprived by the non-observance of the sabbaths and the sabbath-years, contrary to the will of its Creator; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a>. That this is the thought is placed beyond doubt by the succeeding circumstantial clause, taken word for word from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a> : "all days (i.e., the whole time) of its desolation did it hold it" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1492;, it kept sabbath). "To make full the seventy years;" which Jeremiah, ll. cc., had prophesied.<p>This connecting of Jeremiah's prophecy with the declaration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a> does not justify us in supposing that the celebration of the sabbath-year had been neglected seventy times, or that for a period of 490 years the sabbath-year had not been observed. Bertheau, holding this view, fixes upon 1000 b.c., i.e., the time of Solomon, or, as we cannot expect any very great chronological exactitude, the beginning of the kingly government in Israel, as the period after which the rest-years ceased to be regarded. He is further of opinion that <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a> harmonizes with this view; according to which passage the passover was not celebrated in accordance with the prescription of the law until the end of the period of the judges. According to this chronological calculation, the beginning of this neglect of the observance of the sabbath-year would fall in the beginning of the judgeship of Samuel.<p>(Note: The seventy years' exile began in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, i.e., in the year 606 b.c., or 369 years after the division of the kingdom; see the Chronol. Tables at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a> (ii. 3, S. 141), to which the eighty years of the reigns of David and Solomon, and the time of Saul and Samuel, must be added to make up the 490 years (see the comment. on Judges).)<p>But this is itself unlikely; and still more unlikely is it, that in the time of the judges the sabbath-year had been regularly observed until Samuel; and that during the reigns of the kings David, Solomon, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Josiah, this celebration remained wholly in abeyance. But even apart from that, the words, that the land, to make full the seventy years prophesied by Jeremiah, kept the whole time of the desolation holy, or enjoyed a sabbath rest such as Moses had proclaimed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-34.htm">Leviticus 26:34</a>, do not necessarily involve that the land had been deprived of its sabbath rest seventy times in succession, or during a period of 490 years, by the sin of the people. The connection between the prophecy of Jeremiah and the provision of the law is to be understood theologically, and does not purport to be calculated chronologically. The thought is this: By the infliction of the punishment threatened against the transgressors of the law by the carrying of the people away captive into Babylon, the land will obtain the rest which the sinful people had deprived it of by their neglect of the sabbath observance commanded them. By causing it to remain uncultivated for seventy years, God gave to the land a time of rest and refreshment, which its inhabitants, so long as they possessed it, had not given it. But that does not mean that the time for which this rest was granted corresponded to the number of the sabbath-years which had not been observed. From these theological reflections we cannot calculate how often in the course of the centuries, from the time of Joshua onwards till the exile, the sabbath-year had not been observed; and still less the time after which the observation of the sabbath-year was continuously neglected. The passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-8.htm">2 Chronicles 35:8</a> has no bearing on this question, because it neither states that the passover had been held according to the precepts of the law till towards the end of the time of the judges, nor that it was no longer celebrated in accordance with the precept from that time until Josiah; it only contains the thought that such a passover as that in Josiah's reign had not been held since the time of the judges: see on the passage. </body></html>
