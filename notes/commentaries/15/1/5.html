The same influence that prompted the decree of Cyrus was necessary to overcome the inertness of the captives: many preferred to remain in Babylon.—The people were enumerated as tribes, families, and fathers’ houses; the second and third orders of classification are not here distinguished from each other.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">Precious things.</span>—The Hebrew equivalent is a rare word, which, when it occurs, is connected only with the precious metals.<p><span class= "bld">Willingly offered.</span>—Although it is not so said, the people of Cyrus were <span class= "ital">“</span>stirred up” like himself: how much he gave, and how much he valued the worship of the Temple, we shall hereafter see.<p>(7) <span class= "bld">His gods.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">his god.</span> Merodach, to wit, whom he called “his lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-2.htm" title="And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.">Daniel 1:2</a>). From <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/25-13.htm" title="And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.">2Kings 25:13-17</a> it appears that much had been taken away which Cyrus had not been able to find.<p>(8) <span class= "bld">Mithredath.</span>—“Dedicated to Mithra,” the sun god of the Persians, whose worship among the Vedic Indians had thus early reached Persia.<p><span class= "bld">Sheshbazzar.</span>—The Chaldee name of Zerubbabel, whose title, however, as Prince of Judah is given him from the Hebrew side. He was the legal heir of Jehoiachin, being the son of Pedaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-19.htm" title="And the sons of Pedaiah were, Zerubbabel, and Shimei: and the sons of Zerubbabel; Meshullam, and Hananiah, and Shelomith their sister:">1Chronicles 3:19</a>), who possibly married the widow of Salathiel or Shealtiel. And the title “Prince of Judah,” or “Prince of the captivity,” was specially given to him in common with a very few others.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Chargers and knives.</span>—Rare words in the original, perhaps on the whole best rendered as here.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">Of a second sort.</span>—Of inferior quality.<p>(11) <span class= "bld">Five thousand and four hundred.</span>—The total of the several sums should be in round numbers, such as are frequently used, two thousand and five hundred. Obviously, therefore, the writer, whom we must needs suppose to have his own previous numbers before him, here includes vessels not before enumerated as chargers and basons.<p><span class= "bld">Bring up.</span>—They were not, as sometimes said, the freewill offering of Cyrus. Sheshbazzar brought these rich vessels “with them of the captivity,” and they were sent as already belonging to God, who vindicated by His judgment on Babylon their desecration at the feast of Belshazzar.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezra/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-5.htm" title="Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:5</a>. <span class="ital">Then rose up the chief of the fathers, </span>&c. — Eminent and experienced men, from whom it might justly be expected, that, as they were above their brethren in dignity, so they should go before them in duty. <span class="ital">Of Judah and Benjamin — </span>And with them some of the other tribes, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-3.htm" title="And in Jerusalem dwelled of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;">1 Chronicles 9:3</a>; but these only are named, because they were most considerable for number and quality. <span class="ital">And the priests and Levites — </span>Who, as became them, were among the first that set their faces toward Zion. If any good work is to be done, let ministers take the lead in it. <span class="ital">With all whose spirit God had raised, to go up </span>— Whom he had inspired with reverence and love for himself as the God of Israel, and a deep concern for the restoration of his worship at Jerusalem, and with that resolution and fortitude which were requisite to enable them to break through the difficulties and discouragements which were in their way. These were undoubtedly great and many; such as their present penury; the length, and hazards, and expenses of the journey; their being dispersed in several and distant places, which prevented the conjunction of their counsels and actions; the multitude of their enemies; the actual possession of their country by others; the ruinous state of Jerusalem, and the other cities and towns of Judea; and the great backwardness of many of their own brethren to go with them. Add to this, the temptation was strong to some of them to stay in Babylon, being conveniently and comfortably settled there, and having contracted an acquaintance with their neighbours, such as was agreeable and pleasing to them. By these and such like considerations, many were induced to remain where they were, or at least not to go with the first that went. But there were some that broke through these difficulties, and they were those <span class="ital">whose spirits God had raised up: </span>whom by his Spirit he had inspired with a generous desire of liberty, and a gracious affection to their own land, the land God had given them, and a desire for the free and public exercise of their religion. Had God left them to themselves, and to the counsels of flesh and blood, they would have stayed in Babylon: but, as he had raised up the spirit of Cyrus to proclaim this liberty, so he raised up their spirits to take the benefit of it, and set their faces toward Zion, as strangers asking the way thither, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-5.htm" title="They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.">Jeremiah 50:5</a>. For, being a new generation, they went out, like their father Abraham, from this land of the Chaldees, not knowing whither they went.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:5-11 The same God that raised up the spirit of Cyrus to proclaim liberty to the Jews, raised up their spirits to take the benefit. The temptation was to some to stay in Babylon; but some feared not to return, and they were those whose spirits God raised, by his Spirit and grace. Whatever good we do, is owing to the grace of God. Our spirits naturally bow down to this earth and the things of it; if they move upward in any good affections or good actions, it is God who raises them. The calls and offers of the gospel are like the proclamation of Cyrus. Those bound under the power of sin, may be made free by Jesus Christ. Whosoever will, by repentance and faith, return to God, Jesus Christ has opened the way for him, and raises him out of the slavery of sin into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Many that hear this joyful sound, choose to sit still in Babylon, are in love with their sins, and will not venture upon a holy life; but some break through all discouragements, whatever it cost them; they are those whose spirit God has raised above the world and the flesh, whom he has made willing. Thus will the heavenly Canaan be filled, though many perish in Babylon; and the gospel offer will not have been made in vain. The bringing back the Jews from captivity, represents the redemption of sinners by Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Only a portion of the Israelites took advantage of the permission of Cyrus.

Then rose up the chief of the fathers, &c.&#8212;The paternal and ecclesiastical chiefs of the later captivity, those of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, with some also from other tribes (1Ch 9:3), who retained their attachment to the pure worship of God, naturally took the lead in this movement. Their example was followed by all whose piety and patriotism were strong enough to brave the various discouragements attending the enterprise. They were liberally assisted by multitudes of their captive countrymen, who, born in Babylonia or comfortably established in it by family connections or the possession of property, chose to remain. It seems that their Assyrian friends and neighbors, too, either from a favorable disposition toward the Jewish faith, or from imitation of the court policy, displayed hearty good will and great liberality in aiding and promoting the views of the emigrants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin; </span> and with them some of other tribes, as appears from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-3.htm" title="And in Jerusalem dwelled of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;">1 Chronicles 9:3</a></span>; but these only are named, because they were most considerable for number and quality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whose spirit God had raised to go up; </span> to whom God had given that pious disposition, and that fortitude and resolution, which it required to break through their difficulties, which were great and many, such as their present penury, the length, and hazards, and costliness of the journey, their settlements in comfortable habitations, their dispersion in several and distant places, which hindered the conjunction of their counsels and actions, the multitude of their enemies, the actual possession of their country by others, the great backwardness of many of their own brethren to go with them, and many other discouragements. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin,....

Literally rendered, the term would be ‘the heads of the fathers’. Cf. the Latin ‘principes patrum’.

The preposition ‘to’ or ‘for’ stands before ‘all’, and the relative is omitted. The A.V. takes the clause to briefly summarize ‘the rest’ (i.e. the supplementary list of them) who, not being classed under (<span class="ital">a</span>) the heads of fathers’ houses of Judah and Benjamin, (<span class="ital">b</span>) priests, (<span class="ital">c</span>) Levites, formed a fourth division of the people. By comparison with other passages such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/13-1.htm" title="And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader....">1 Chronicles 13:1-2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-12.htm" title="Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brothers, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>, where the same or a similar construction in the original is found, we see that the R.V. is correct. The preposition does not supplement, it defines. All included under the <span class="ital">three</span> groups mentioned in the verse, ‘rose up’. The whole community is summed up under these three heads, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm" title="And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy.">Ezra 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-20.htm" title="For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.">Ezra 6:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whose spirit God had raised</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">had stirred up.</span> The same phrase as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm" title="Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,">Ezra 1:1</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-5.htm" title="Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:5</a> follows as the direct result of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm" title="Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,">Ezra 1:1</a>.

In the A.V. these words are by the punctuation connected with the main verb ‘rose up’.

With this comforting prospect for the future, the author of the Chronicle closes his consideration of the prae-exilic history of the people of God without completely communicating the contents of the royal edict of Cyrus, since he purposed to narrate the history of the restoration of Judah to their own land in a separate work. This we have in the book of Ezra, which commences by giving us the whole of the edict of Cyrus the king of the Persians (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1-3</a>), and then narrates the return of a great part of the people to Jerusalem and Judah, the rebuilding of the temple, and the re-settlement in the land of their fathers of those who had returned. </body></html>
