The temptation was to some to stay in Babylon; but some feared not to return, and they were those whose spirits God raised, by his Spirit and grace. Whatever good we do, is owing to the grace of God. Our spirits naturally bow down to this earth and the things of it; if they move upward in any good affections or good actions, it is God who raises them. The calls and offers of the gospel are like the proclamation of Cyrus. Those bound under the power of sin, may be made free by Jesus Christ. Whosoever will, by repentance and faith, return to God, Jesus Christ has opened the way for him, and raises him out of the slavery of sin into the glorious liberty of the children of God. Many that hear this joyful sound, choose to sit still in Babylon, are in love with their sins, and will not venture upon a holy life; but some break through all discouragements, whatever it cost them; they are those whose spirit God has raised above the world and the flesh, whom he has made willing. Thus will the heavenly Canaan be filled, though many perish in Babylon; and the gospel offer will not have been made in vain. The bringing back the Jews from captivity, represents the redemption of sinners by Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sum of the numbers as they stand in the present Hebrew text is 2,499, instead of 5,400. In the Apocryphal Book of Esdras the sum given is 5,469, and with this sum the items in that place exactly agree (1 Esdras 2:13, 14). Most commentators propose to correct Ezra by the passage of Esdras; but the items of Esdras are improbable. Probably the sum total in the present passage has suffered corruption. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred&#8212;The vessels here specified amount only to the number of 2499. Hence it is probable that the larger vases only are mentioned, while the inventory of the whole, including great and small, came to the gross sum stated in the text.<p>them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem&#8212;All the Jewish exiles did not embrace the privilege which the Persian king granted them. The great proportion, born in Babylon, preferred continuing in their comfortable homes to undertaking a distant, expensive, and hazardous journey to a desolate land. Nor did the returning exiles all go at once. The first band went with Zerubbabel, others afterwards with Ezra, and a large number with Nehemiah at a still later period.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>All the vessels of gold, and of silver, were five thousand and four hundred,.... Those that are mentioned make no more than 2499, which Aben Ezra thinks were the larger vessels; but this general sum takes in great and small, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-18.htm">2 Chronicles 36:18</a> in the letter of Cyrus, before mentioned, these vessels are more particularly described, and their several numbers given, which together amount to the exact number in the text, 5400; the apocryphal Ezra makes them 5469: <p>all these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity, that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem: of whom there is a large and particular account in the following chapter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezra/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">All the vessels of gold and of silver <i>were</i> five thousand and four hundred.

The sum total however mentioned here is 5400. The vessels enumerated under the six classes (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/1-9.htm" title="And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,...">Ezra 1:9-10</a>), when added together, make only 2499. Unless we concede that the text is incorrect, the only solution of the variation is to suppose that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/1-9.htm" title="And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,...">Ezra 1:9-10</a> omit a large number of less important vessels. This is unsatisfactory, since the words ‘and other vessels a thousand’ are obviously intended to cover the remainder.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is probable therefore that the discrepancy arises from some ancient corruption in the text, which has been caused by copyists’ errors in transcribing numbers. This is a frequent source of mistake.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LXX. has the same text as the Hebrew, so that the error is of very ancient origin. The 1st Book of Esdras has two variations in the list of items, reading (1) ‘1000’ for ‘30’ ‘chargers of gold’, (2) ‘2410’ for ‘410’ ‘silver bowls’ (reading ‘2000’ instead of ‘a second sort’), and gives a total corresponding to its figures, i.e. 5469.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Some scholars, seeing in the variations of 1 Esdras a clue to the true solution, maintain that the corruption of the text is to be found in the figures both of the items and of the total (<span class="ital">a</span>) They reject the variation of ‘1000’ for ‘30’ chargers as a round number inserted by 1 Esdras; (<span class="ital">b</span>) they read ‘1000’ for ‘30’ ‘bowls of gold’, on the ground that 30 is too small a figure, since Ezra himself brought 20 of this description (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-28.htm" title="And I said to them, You are holy to the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers.">Ezra 8:28</a>); (<span class="ital">c</span>) they read ‘2410’ for ‘410 of a second sort,’ on the authority of 1 Esdras. These alterations bring the total to 5469, agreeing with 1 Esdras.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ewald (<span class="ital">a</span>) combining the reading of Ezra and 1 Esdras reads ‘1030’ for ‘30’ ‘chargers’, (<span class="ital">b</span>) keeping the ‘30’ ‘bowls of gold’, accepts the 1 Esdras reading of 2410, and thus obtains the total of 5499.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Keil suspecting that the corruption is to be found in the sum total rather than in the items, suggests that by an accidental transposition of figures the true number of 2500 has become altered to 5400.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In favour of this view, it must be admitted that (1) the figure of 5400 is surprisingly large, (2) copyists had a greater tendency to increase than to reduce numbers. But as the items are given in detail, so we should expect the sum total to be given exactly and not merely in a round number. As we have the two best texts agreeing in this total figure 5400, it is better to look for the error among the items. The reading of 1 Esdras ‘2410’ may possibly be correct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But in the absence of further evidence we are left to conjecture either that some items have accidentally fallen out or that some of the present figures have been wrongly transcribed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with</span> them of <span class="ital">the captivity that were brought up</span>] <span class="bld">R.V. when they of the captivity were brought up.</span> The original here is rather condensed.

The emphasis is on the <span class="ital">time</span> of the removal—not on the <span class="ital">caravan</span> which accompanied it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">were brought up</span>] the same word used of the ‘breaking up’ of a camp in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,">Jeremiah 37:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the captivity</span>] the reader will notice that the journey of Sheshbazzar and his companions from Babylon to Jerusalem is disposed of in a single verse. We hear nothing of the details or of the difficulties of the journey, which must have lasted three or four months, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/7-8.htm" title="And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king....">Ezra 7:8-9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It has been suggested that here should be introduced the passage <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/5-1.htm" title="After this were the principal men of the families chosen according to their tribes, to go up with their wives and sons and daughters, with their menservants and maidservants, and their cattle....">1Es 5:1-6</a> ‘After this were the principal men of the families chosen according to their tribes, to go up with their wives and sons and daughters, with their menservants and maidservants and cattle.

(<span class="ital">c</span>) There is nothing impossible, supposing the passage to be a genuine extract from existing records, in such an expedition having been made in the second year of king Darius, and in supposing that the arrival of this priestly contingent would have encouraged the prophets Haggai and Zechariah in their task of arousing the people to complete the Temple (cf. the second year of Darius <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm" title="In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,">Haggai 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-1.htm" title="In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,">Zechariah 1:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The journey, which would have probably been N. and N.W. along the Euphrates by Haran as far as the fords of Carchemish, and then S.W. and S. through the territory of the old kingdoms of Hamath, Syria and Samaria, must have occupied a considerable interval of time. Ezra and his band took four months (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/7-8.htm" title="And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king....">Ezra 7:8-9</a>) in accomplishing the same distance.
