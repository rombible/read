Nothing can be more false, for true godliness teaches us to honour and obey our sovereign. But where the command of God requires one thing and the law of the land another, we must obey God rather than man, and patiently submit to the consequences. All who love the gospel should avoid all appearance of evil, lest they should encourage the adversaries of the church. The world is ever ready to believe any accusation against the people of God, and refuses to listen to them. The king suffered himself to be imposed upon by these frauds and falsehoods. Princes see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, and judge things as represented to them, which are often done falsely.

Furthermore, as the letter is said to have been written in Aramaic, and we pass immediately from Hebrew into Aramaic, this in itself would be a reason for supposing that <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm" title="Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:">Ezra 4:8</a> &c. described more fully in detail the writing mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm" title="And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.">Ezra 4:7</a>.

Having mentioned what took place in the reign of Xerxes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-6.htm" title="And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.">Ezra 4:6</a>), the Compiler goes on to state that there were two such written accusations in the days of Artaxerxes. The first he says was written by Bishlam &c., the second by Rehum &c. In his mention of the first letter, he either condenses the full document into a brief notice or was only able to discover a short statement in the public chronicles. In his mention of the second, he is able to lay the document before his readers, obtaining it from an Aramaic chronicle, from which he makes a long extract and introduces it without further preface.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This explanation accounts for (<span class="ital">a</span>) the abrupt transition from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm" title="And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.">Ezra 4:7</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm" title="Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:">Ezra 4:8</a>, (<span class="ital">b</span>) the mention in both verses of a letter written to Artaxerxes, (<span class="ital">c</span>) the continuance of the Aramaic language in the narrative, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-17.htm" title="Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.">Ezra 5:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-18.htm" title="And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.">Ezra 6:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel</span>] Names of foreign colonists, ‘Bishlam’ the LXX. renders ‘in peace’ (<span class="greekheb">ἐν εἰρήνη</span>) as if not a proper name.

The LXX. renders it ‘the tax-collector’ (<span class="greekheb">ὁ φορολόγος</span>), the Vulgate ‘accusationis’. It is pronounced ‘nisht’ewân’ and is compared with a modern Persian ‘nuwischten’ to write. Perhaps the word occurred in the records from which the Compiler obtained his information as to the letter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue</span>] R.V. ‘<span class="bld">was written In the Syrian</span> character, <span class="bld">and set forth in the Syrian</span> tongue’, margin ‘<span class="ital">Or Aramaic</span>’ for ‘Syrian’. This is all we hear about the letter. What occasioned its composition and how it was received we do not know.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We gather from this verse that in the days of Artaxerxes the official correspondence of the Syrian province or satrapy was conducted in Aramaic. This indeed, had been the language of diplomatic communication in the days of the Assyrian monarchy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-26.htm" title="Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.">2 Kings 18:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-11.htm" title="Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.">Isaiah 36:11</a>). As the language of diplomacy and commerce among the races of Western Asia, it held its own with Greek and was only finally displaced in a much later time by the diffusion of Arabic, which followed upon the successes of the Mahommedans (see Introduction on ‘the Aramaic language’). The strange thing is that its use should have been made the subject of special remark in this verse. But probably the point to which attention is drawn, is the fact of the letter being written in Aramaic characters as well as expressed in the Aramaic tongue. The early Aramaic Alphabet probably differed considerably from the early Hebrew. The mention of the Aramaic characters is perhaps adduced as a proof that the Compiler had either seen the actual letter or obtained the account from a source which mentioned this point particularly. The verse shows conclusively that Aramaic was not yet the language of the Jewish people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/4-7.htm" title="And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue....">Ezra 4:7-23</a>The names of the Persian kings which occur in this chapter occasion special difficulty.

The names Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes are assigned to the two kings Cambyses and Pseudo-Smerdis, who reigned between Cyrus and Darius. The advantage of this theory is obvious. The narrative flows smoothly on. The events of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/4-6.htm" title="And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem....">Ezra 4:6-23</a> amplify the statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-5.htm" title="And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.">Ezra 4:5</a>, and belong to the short period 529–521.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The objections that are presented (<span class="ital">a</span>) by the interchange of the names, (<span class="ital">b</span>) by the mention, in the letter, of the building of the city walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-12.htm" title="Be it known to the king, that the Jews which came up from you to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.">Ezra 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-16.htm" title="We certify the king that, if this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up, by this means you shall have no portion on this side the river.">Ezra 4:16</a>), rather than of the Temple, on which the Jews were at work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-1.htm" title="Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity built the temple to the LORD God of Israel;">Ezra 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-4.htm" title="Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,">Ezra 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-14.htm" title="Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore have we sent and certified the king;">Ezra 4:14</a>), have been met in the following way. (<span class="ital">a</span>) It is said that the names Xerxes and Artaxerxes are appellatives, like Pharaoh and Cæsar, which could be applied to any Persian monarch, e.g. Cambyses is called Artaxerxes by Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> ix. 2. 1). Furthermore it is argued that the Pseudo-Smerdis appears in history under several different names. (<span class="ital">b</span>) It is supposed that the Samaritans would represent the Jewish undertaking in the most hostile light, as aggressive fortification rather than Temple building; and it must be remembered that the outer walls and outworks of the Temple were always the strongest fortifications in the city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the other hand it seems fatal to this view that even if Xerxes and Artaxerxes are dynastic titles and not strictly names, no well-attested evidence is forthcoming of their promiscuous application. Josephus’ history of this period is notoriously imperfect and inaccurate, and he, it is to be noted, calls <span class="ital">Cambyses</span>, Artaxerxes, although the defenders of this view hold that Cambyses is called Xerxes and Pseudo-Smerdis Artaxerxes.—It is surely rather unfortunate, to say the least, that supposing the names to be interchangeable, the interchange is not found elsewhere, and cannot even be proved from Josephus, whose evidence is chiefly relied upon. But the fact is that neither the testimony of Josephus nor, we may add, of Jewish tradition can be relied on for this period of history. The Jewish tradition appended to Nehemiah in the Masoretic note gives ‘the years from the 1st year of Cyrus king of the Persians to the 32nd year of Artaxerxes the king,’ (i.e. from 538–433) as <span class="ital">fifty-one:</span> while Hebrew commentary gives the Persian kings as Darius the Mede (1 year), Cyrus his son (2 years), Ahasuerus (14 years), Cyrus his son called Artaxerxes (32 years). Nor is it more satisfactory to see how the Pseudo-Smerdis is identified with Artaxerxes. Gomates or the Pseudo-Smerdis, it is said, appears under very different names, e.g. Mardus in Aeschylus (<span class="ital">Pers.</span> 771), Smerdis in Herodotus, Speudadates in Ctesias, and hence, why not as Artaxerxes here? But the very fact that he is called by so many different names, and never once Artaxerxes, is not favourable to the identification. Again, the argument that Pseudo-Smerdis being a Magian would heartily oppose the building of the Temple is strangely at variance with the omission in the letters of any reference to the Temple. It is equally at variance with the other contention, that the Temple building is not referred to because the mention of fortified walls would be more likely to arouse the king’s indignation than that of sacred buildings. If further proof were needed of the improbability that ‘Artaxerxes’ is Pseudo-Smerdis, it would seem to be supplied by a recollection of the troubled time that followed upon the death of Cambyses. Pseudo-Smerdis’ 7 months’ reign was spent in the midst of suspicion, disquiet, and confusion. The hearing of petty complaints and the investigation of ancient chronicles is not what we should expect from a reign which had hardly ceased to be the work of usurpation when it had begun to close in ignominy. The Samaritans were not likely to imperil their cause by approaching, in a time of confusion, a sovereign of doubtful claims whose acts would inevitably be reversed by any successful rival.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But apart from the consideration of its details, the crowning condemnation of this view is to be found in its main hypothesis, that Xerxes and Artaxerxes do not here mean the kings generally known as Xerxes and Artaxerxes but two other kings, the mention of whose names would remove a difficulty from the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(ii) The other view requires us to admit the presence of an interruption in the chronological sequence of the book. Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes are the Xerxes and Artaxerxes (Longimanus) familiar to us under those names. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/4-6.htm" title="And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem....">Ezra 4:6-23</a> do not expand the substance of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-5.htm" title="And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.">Ezra 4:5</a>, but they continue the historical treatment of its subject. That subject is the opposition of the Samaritans; and it is shown how their opposition displayed itself in the reigns of Xerxes and Artaxerxes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The introduction of the times of Xerxes and Artaxerxes into this chapter interrupts, we must admit, the thread of the narrative. The passage, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/4-8.htm" title="Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:...">Ezra 4:8-23</a></span>, is inserted by the Compiler at this point because he imagined it related to the building of the Temple. The names of the kings did not suggest to him his error. Whether this should be charged to mere inadvertency, or to ignorance of the Persian history, we cannot say.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The tone of the letters fully bears out this supposition. There is no allusion to the Temple. The Temple had been erected many years ago. The complaint is made that the people are fortifying the city. Such a complaint, made to the Persian king after the war with Greece, with reference to a city only a day’s march from the coast, had more significance than it could have had in the preceding century. It demanded serious consideration. The description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm" title="And they said to me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.">Nehemiah 1:3</a> of the condition of the city walls and gates seems to imply devastation more recent than that of the Babylonians 140 years previously. The violent measures of the Samaritans which ‘by force and power’ compelled the Jews to desist from their work may well account for this description. The intercession of Nehemiah procured the favour of ‘the decree’ which the king had declared to be necessary before any building was resumed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-21.htm" title="Give you now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not built, until another commandment shall be given from me.">Ezra 4:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such an explanation fairly accounts for the presence of the names Xerxes and Artaxerxes. The internal evidence of the passage corresponds with it happily. The insertion of these ‘anticipatory’ fragments seems to us undoubtedly harsh. But it is very questionable whether in a work of such composite character it is not more natural to find occasionally an instance of harshness or inartistic arrangement due to compilation, than everywhere the smooth orderliness of th skilful modern historian.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the days of Artaxerxes.</span> See the comment on ver. 6. If Artaxerxes be the Pseudo-Smerdis, we can readily understand why an application was not made to him at once, and how it came about that the Jews recommenced their building, as they appear from vers. 12, 13 to have done. The Pseudo-Smerdis was a usurper; his reign was a time of partial anarchy; in a distant part of the empire it would not be known for a while who was king. Men would be thrown on themselves, and would do as it seemed good in their own eyes. Later, there may have been some doubt whether a king, who was known to be a religious reformer, would follow the policy of his predecessor with respect to the Jews, or reverse it. Hence a delay, and then a more formal application than before for a positive decree to stop the building (see ver. 21). <span class="cmt_word">The rest of their companions</span>.

When the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the community which had returned from captivity were beginning to rebuild the temple, they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chiefs of the people, and desired to take part in this work, because they also sacrificed to the God of Israel. These adversaries were, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>, the people whom Esarhaddon king of Assyria had settled in the neighbourhood of Benjamin and Judah. If we compare with this verse the information (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>) that the kings of Assyria brought men from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria, and that they took possession of the depopulated kingdom of the ten tribes, and dwelt therein; then these adversaries of Judah and Benjamin are the inhabitants of the former kingdom of Israel, who were called Samaritans after the central-point of their settlement. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, sons of the captivity (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-19.htm">Ezra 6:19</a>, etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-7.htm">Ezra 10:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-16.htm">Ezra 10:16</a>), also shortly into &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-11.htm">Ezra 1:11</a>, are the Israelites returned from the Babylonian captivity, who composed the new community in Judah and Jerusalem. Those who returned with Zerubbabel, and took possession of the dwelling-places of their ancestors, being, exclusive of priests and Levites, chiefly members of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, are called, especially when named in distinction from the other inhabitants of the land, Judah and Benjamin. The adversaries give the reason of their request to share in the building of the temple in the words: "For we seek your God as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, which brought us up hither." The words &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; are variously explained. Older expositors take the Chethiv &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; as a negative, and make &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; to mean the offering of sacrifices to idols, both because &#1500;&#1488; is a negative, and also because the assertion that they had sacrificed to Jahve would not have pleased the Jews, quia deficiente templo non debuerint sacrificare; and sacrifices not offered in Jerusalem were regarded as equivalent to sacrifices to idols. They might, moreover, fitly strengthen their case by the remark: "Since the days of Esarhaddon we offer no sacrifices to idols." On the other hand, however, it is arbitrary to understand &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;, without any further definition, of sacrificing to idols; and the statement, "We already sacrifice to the God of Israel," contains undoubtedly a far stronger reason for granting their request than the circumstance that they do not sacrifice to idols. Hence we incline, with older translators (lxx, Syr., Vulg., 1 Esdras), to regard &#1500;&#1488; as an unusual form of &#1500;&#1493;, occurring in several places (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>), the latter being also substituted in the present instance as Keri. The position also of &#1500;&#1488; before &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; points the same way, for the negative would certainly have stood with the verb. On Esarhaddon, see remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>. </body></html>
