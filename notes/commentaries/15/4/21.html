Nothing can be more false, for true godliness teaches us to honour and obey our sovereign. But where the command of God requires one thing and the law of the land another, we must obey God rather than man, and patiently submit to the consequences. All who love the gospel should avoid all appearance of evil, lest they should encourage the adversaries of the church. The world is ever ready to believe any accusation against the people of God, and refuses to listen to them. The king suffered himself to be imposed upon by these frauds and falsehoods. Princes see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, and judge things as represented to them, which are often done falsely. But God's judgment is just; he sees things as they are.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mighty kings ... - If this reference can scarcely have been to David or Solomon (see marginal reference), of whom neither the Babylonian nor the Assyrian archives would be likely to have had any account - it would probably be to Menahem <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a> and Josiah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. we have maintenance from the king's palace&#8212;literally, "we are salted with the salt of the palace."
