Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, &c.&#8212;Exasperated by this repulse, the Samaritans endeavored by every means to molest the workmen as well as obstruct the progress of the building; and, though they could not alter the decree which Cyrus had issued regarding it, yet by bribes and clandestine arts indefatigably plied at court, they labored to frustrate the effects of the edict. Their success in those underhand dealings was great; for Cyrus, being frequently absent and much absorbed in his warlike expeditions, left the government in the hands of his son Cambyses, a wicked prince, and extremely hostile to the Jews and their religion. The same arts were assiduously practised during the reign of his successor, Smerdis, down to the time of Darius Hystaspes. In consequence of the difficulties and obstacles thus interposed, for a period of twenty years, the progress of the work was very slow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The people of the land, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">of that land</span>; the present inhabitants of that province, to wit, the Samaritans. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Troubled them in building; </span> by false reports and threats, and other means, described afterwards. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building.

It is noteworthy that this expression ‘the people of the land’ (’am haâreç) became a synonym for ‘the ignorant’ or ‘the vulgar’ in contrast to ‘the wise’, with special reference to a knowledge of ‘the law’. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-49.htm" title="But this people who knows not the law are cursed.">John 7:49</a> ‘This people who knoweth not the law are cursed’. Buxtorf gives illustrations by the Jewish proverbs ‘Better is the bastard who is the disciple of the wise than the high-priest of the people of the land’ (i.e. who is ‘vulgar’) ‘The people of the land (i.e. the ‘vulgar’) have degrees of morals but none of intelligence’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">weakened the hands</span>] The Hebrew construction gives the idea of a continuous policy of weakening, terrifying, and bribing. For the phrase itself compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm" title="Therefore the princes said to the king, We beseech you, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man seeks not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.">Jeremiah 38:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the people of Judah</span>] ‘The children of the captivity’ are here given the name of the old southern kingdom. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-12.htm" title="Be it known to the king, that the Jews which came up from you to us are come to Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and joined the foundations.">Ezra 4:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">troubled</span>] so R.V.: marg. Or ‘<span class="ital">terrified</span>’. There are two readings. The reading of the Hebrew text or K’thib gives a word that does not occur elsewhere in the O.T. but is connected with a substantive rendered ‘terror’ (R.V. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-14.htm" title="And behold at evening trouble; and before the morning he is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.">Isaiah 17:14</a>). The reading of the Hebrew tradition or K’ri, preserved with the text, gives an otherwise unused form of a common word meaning ‘to trouble’. In all probability the letters of the unused root were transposed by a scribe so as to give the familiar root; preference should be given to the harder rendering, ‘terrified them from building’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Then <span class="cmt_word">the people of the land</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Samaritans) <span class="cmt_word">weakened the hands of the people of Judah.</span> As aiding is called "strengthening the hands (<span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-22.htm">Ezra 6:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-3.htm">Isaiah 35:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>, etc.), so hindering is expressed by "weakening the hands" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4</a>), though this latter phrase is, comparatively speaking, unusual. <span class="cmt_word">And troubled them in building</span>.
