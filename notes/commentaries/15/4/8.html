Nothing can be more false, for true godliness teaches us to honour and obey our sovereign. But where the command of God requires one thing and the law of the land another, we must obey God rather than man, and patiently submit to the consequences. All who love the gospel should avoid all appearance of evil, lest they should encourage the adversaries of the church. The world is ever ready to believe any accusation against the people of God, and refuses to listen to them. The king suffered himself to be imposed upon by these frauds and falsehoods. Princes see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, and judge things as represented to them, which are often done falsely. But God's judgment is just; he sees things as they are.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chancellor - literally, "Lord of judgment;" the title, apparently, of the Persian governor of the Samaritan province.

At this verse begins the first long section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm" title="Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:">Ezra 4:8</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-18.htm" title="And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which is at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.">Ezra 6:18</a>) written in the Aramaic language (see Introd.), which the Compiler has probably extracted bodily from Aramaic records.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm" title="Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:">Ezra 4:8</a> introduces briefly the description of the letter of accusation against the Jews sent by Rehum and Shimshai.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe</span>] Rehum was probably the chief official of the Samaritan community. The name is considered by some to be of Persian origin, and a contraction of some longer Persian name, e.g. Rheomithres, which is found in Arrian. It appears also in Jewish lists (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm" title="Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.

Next to him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his part.">Nehemiah 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-25.htm" title="Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,">Nehemiah 10:25</a>), but that need not exclude its foreign origin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the chancellor</span>] Literally ‘the lord of judgement’. Sayce suggests ‘lord of official intelligence’, the Aramaic word for ‘judgement’ being practically identical with the Assyrian word ‘dhem’, used of the official reports sent to the king by provincial rulers. Here the title apparently belongs to the chief officer of the district.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the LXX., Syr. and Vulg. the title not being understood appears as a proper name; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/2-16.htm" title="But in the time of Artaxerxes king of the Persians Belemus, and Mithridates, and Tabellius, and Rathumus, and Beeltethmus, and Semellius the secretary, with others that were in commission with them, dwelling in Samaria and other places, wrote unto him against them that dwelt in Judea and Jerusalem these letters following;">1Es 2:16</a> makes the same error ‘Rathumus and Beeltethmus’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Shimshai</span>] Perhaps the same name as the Persian ‘Sisamnes’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the scribe</span>] i.e. the governor’s secretary. Each governor of a Persian province was attended by this official (Herod. III. 128), who acted as a check upon the governor as well as for administrative purposes.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rehum</span> <span class="cmt_word">the chancellor.</span> Literally, "the lord of judgment." It may be conjectured that Rehum was the sub-satrap (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, Xen.), of the province of Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">And Shimshai the scribe.</span> Or "secretary." Herodotus tells us that in every Persian province the governor had a secretary attached to him, who was appointed by the crown, and acted as a check upon his nominal master (Herod., 3:128). The position assigned to Shim-shai in this chapter (see especially vers. 9, 17, 23) is such as might be expected under these circumstances. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The adversaries of the Jews prevent the building of the temple till the reign of Darius (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>). When the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the community which had returned from captivity were beginning to rebuild the temple, they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chiefs of the people, and desired to take part in this work, because they also sacrificed to the God of Israel. These adversaries were, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a>, the people whom Esarhaddon king of Assyria had settled in the neighbourhood of Benjamin and Judah. If we compare with this verse the information (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>) that the kings of Assyria brought men from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria, and that they took possession of the depopulated kingdom of the ten tribes, and dwelt therein; then these adversaries of Judah and Benjamin are the inhabitants of the former kingdom of Israel, who were called Samaritans after the central-point of their settlement. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;, sons of the captivity (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-19.htm">Ezra 6:19</a>, etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-7.htm">Ezra 10:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-16.htm">Ezra 10:16</a>), also shortly into &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/1-11.htm">Ezra 1:11</a>, are the Israelites returned from the Babylonian captivity, who composed the new community in Judah and Jerusalem. Those who returned with Zerubbabel, and took possession of the dwelling-places of their ancestors, being, exclusive of priests and Levites, chiefly members of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, are called, especially when named in distinction from the other inhabitants of the land, Judah and Benjamin. The adversaries give the reason of their request to share in the building of the temple in the words: "For we seek your God as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, which brought us up hither." The words &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; are variously explained. Older expositors take the Chethiv &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; as a negative, and make &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; to mean the offering of sacrifices to idols, both because &#1500;&#1488; is a negative, and also because the assertion that they had sacrificed to Jahve would not have pleased the Jews, quia deficiente templo non debuerint sacrificare; and sacrifices not offered in Jerusalem were regarded as equivalent to sacrifices to idols. They might, moreover, fitly strengthen their case by the remark: "Since the days of Esarhaddon we offer no sacrifices to idols." On the other hand, however, it is arbitrary to understand &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;, without any further definition, of sacrificing to idols; and the statement, "We already sacrifice to the God of Israel," contains undoubtedly a far stronger reason for granting their request than the circumstance that they do not sacrifice to idols. Hence we incline, with older translators (lxx, Syr., Vulg., 1 Esdras), to regard &#1500;&#1488; as an unusual form of &#1500;&#1493;, occurring in several places (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-8.htm">Exodus 21:8</a>), the latter being also substituted in the present instance as Keri. The position also of &#1500;&#1488; before &#1488;&#1504;&#1495;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; points the same way, for the negative would certainly have stood with the verb. On Esarhaddon, see remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>. </body></html>
