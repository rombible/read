In ancient times, it appears, it was usual to allow those who had deserved well, and on that account were honourably provided for at the king’s charge, among other things, a daily quantity of salt; it being a thing very necessary in human life. Locke, however, who translates the clause, <span class="ital">we have eaten of the king’s salt, </span>understands the meaning to be, “We have engaged ourselves in a covenant of friendship with him.” <span class="ital">It was not meet for us to see the king’s dishonour — </span>Thus they represent themselves as very loyal to the government, and mightily concerned for the honour and interest of it; and hence they urge the king to put a stop to the building of the city and temple of Jerusalem, as what would certainly be to his loss and dishonour.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:6-24 It is an old slander, that the prosperity of the church would be hurtful to kings and princes. Nothing can be more false, for true godliness teaches us to honour and obey our sovereign. But where the command of God requires one thing and the law of the land another, we must obey God rather than man, and patiently submit to the consequences. All who love the gospel should avoid all appearance of evil, lest they should encourage the adversaries of the church. The world is ever ready to believe any accusation against the people of God, and refuses to listen to them. The king suffered himself to be imposed upon by these frauds and falsehoods. Princes see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, and judge things as represented to them, which are often done falsely. But God's judgment is just; he sees things as they are.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We have maintenance - See the margin. The phrase "to eat a man's salt" is common in the East to this day; and is applied not only to those who receive salaries, but to all who obtain their subsistence by means of another. The Persian satraps had no salaries, but taxed their provinces for the support of themselves and their courts. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. we have maintenance from the king's palace&#8212;literally, "we are salted with the salt of the palace."

The LXX. omitted the clause: Vulg. ‘memores salis, quod in palatio comedimus’: <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/2-20.htm" title="And forasmuch as the things pertaining to the temple are now in hand, we think it meet not to neglect such a matter,">1Es 2:20</a>, ‘forasmuch as the things pertaining to the Temple are now on hand’, which substitutes a different sentence for one that was not intelligible. The old Jewish translation ‘because we aforetime destroyed the Temple’, adopted by many former commentators (cf. Luther, ‘Nun wir alle dabei sind, die wir den Tempel zerstöret haben’), seems to have been based upon the old symbolical custom of ‘sowing with salt’ the site of a town or place that had been destroyed, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-45.htm" title="And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.">Jdg 9:45</a>, and upon the idea of unfruitfulness associated with salt (cf. ‘a salt land and not inhabited’, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-6.htm" title="For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.">Jeremiah 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm" title="And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm" title="Therefore as I live, said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and salt pits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.">Zephaniah 2:9</a>; cf. Heb. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-6.htm" title="Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.">Job 39:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-34.htm" title="A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.">Psalm 107:34</a>). Others, with the same conception, ‘we have salted (Jerusalem) with the salt of the palace’, i.e. assisted the Imperial armies in its destruction. ‘The palace’ in the original is the same word (‘heycâl’) as that used for ‘the temple’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-6.htm" title="From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.">Ezra 3:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-14.htm" title="And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;">Ezra 5:14</a>. The ambiguity of this word and the use of a rare metaphor has given rise to the difficulty of translation. Literally, the words mean ‘because we have salted the palace’s salt’. The explanation then will be not, as has been suggested, ‘because we have been entertained (guest friends, i.e. are the king’s friends), at the palace’, but ‘because we are in the king’s service’. The writers as representatives of colonies and dependent districts were very probably officials, and therefore members of the great network of Persian government.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The English word ‘salary’ from salarium or salt-money is generally compared with this phrase.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> it was <span class="ital">not meet</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">and it is not meet</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">dishonour</span>] literally ‘nakedness’. A strong metaphor, which the LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἀσχημοσύνη</span> reproduces. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-7.htm" title="The nakedness of your father, or the nakedness of your mother, shall you not uncover: she is your mother; you shall not uncover her nakedness.">Leviticus 18:7</a>, &c. The order is emphatic, ‘and the shame of the king it is not meet for us to see’. The Vulg. ‘læsiones’ gives the technical Latin word for ‘damage’ in a general sense.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have maintenance from the king's palace</span>. The marginal rendering is better, and shows the true sense. "Eating a man's salt" in the East is deriving one's subsistence from him.
