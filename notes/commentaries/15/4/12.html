Nothing can be more false, for true godliness teaches us to honour and obey our sovereign. But where the command of God requires one thing and the law of the land another, we must obey God rather than man, and patiently submit to the consequences. All who love the gospel should avoid all appearance of evil, lest they should encourage the adversaries of the church. The world is ever ready to believe any accusation against the people of God, and refuses to listen to them. The king suffered himself to be imposed upon by these frauds and falsehoods. Princes see and hear with other men's eyes and ears, and judge things as represented to them, which are often done falsely. But God's judgment is just; he sees things as they are.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A snapper was perhaps the official employed by Esar-haddon <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2</a> to settle the colonists in their new country.<p>On this side the river - literally, "beyond the river," a phrase used of Palestine by Ezra, Nehemiah, and in the Book of Kings, as designating the region west of the Euphrates.<p>And at such a time - Rather, "and so forth."

There had been one, or perhaps two, previous revolts from Assyria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>); but of these the Samaritans probably knew nothing. They would, however, be likely to know that before Nebuchadnezzar took the extreme measure of removing the Jews from their own land to Babylon, they had rebelled against him three several times - once under Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>), once under his son Jehoiachin (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 9, 10), and once under Zedekiah, the last king (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 20).

The Samaritans, however, would naturally exaggerate, and call the rebuilding of the temple, and of a certain number of dwelling-houses, a fortifying of the place. The exaggeration, however, is not so great in the Chaldee text as in the Authorized Version. What is said seems to be, that "they <span class="accented">are setting up the walls and joining the foundations."</span> That the work was far from complete is admitted in the next verse.

In his days, i.e., during his reign, wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions. &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;, for which the Keri offers the ordinary form &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; mrof yra, occurs only here in the Hebrew sections, but more frequently in the Chaldee (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-17.htm">Ezra 4:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-23.htm">Ezra 4:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-3.htm">Ezra 5:3</a>, and elsewhere), in the sense of companions or fellow-citizens; according to Gesenius, it means those who bear the same surname (Kunje) together with another, though Ewald is of a different opinion; see 117, b, note. The singular would be written &#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514; (Ewald, 187, d). And the writing of the letter was written in Aramaean (i.e., with Aramaean characters), and interpreted in (i.e., translated into) Aramaean. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; is of Aryan origin, and connected with the modern Persian nuwishten, to write together; it signifies in Hebrew and Chaldee a letter: comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-18.htm">Ezra 4:18</a>, where &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1488; is used for &#1488;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-11.htm">Ezra 4:11</a>. Bertheau translates &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;, copy of the letter, and regards it as quite identical with the Chaldee &#1488;&#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488; &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-11.htm">Ezra 4:11</a>; he can hardly, however, be in the right. &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; does not mean a transcript or copy, but only a writing (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-8.htm">Esther 4:8</a>). This, too, does away with the inference "that the writer of this statement had before him only an Aramaean translation of the letter contained in the state-papers or chronicles which he made use of." It is not &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;, the copy or writing, but &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, the letter, that is the subject of &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1514;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1501;, interpreted in Aramaean. This was translated into the Aramaean or Syrian tongue. The passage is not to be understood as stating that the letter was drawn up in the Hebrew or Samaritan tongue, and then translated into Aramaean, but simply that the letter was not composed in the native language of the writers, but in Aramaean. Thus Gesenius rightly asserts, in his Thes. p. 1264, et lingua aramaea scripta erat; in saying which &#1514;&#1512;&#1490;&#1501; does not receive the meaning concepit, expressit, but retains its own signification, to interpret, to translate into another language. The writers of the letter were Samaritans, who, having sprung from the intermingling of the Babylonian settlers brought in by Esarhaddon and the remnants of the Israelitish population, spoke a language more nearly akin to Hebrew than to Aramaean, which was spoken at the Babylonian court, and was the official language of the Persian kings and the Persian authorities in Western Asia. This Aramaean tongue had also its own characters, differing from those of the Hebrew and Samaritan. This is stated by the words &#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, whence Bertheau erroneously infers that this Aramaean writing was written in other than the ordinary Aramaean, and perhaps in Hebrew characters.<p>This letter, too, of Bishlam and his companions seems to be omitted. There follows, indeed, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a>, etc., a letter to King Artachshasta, of which a copy is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-11.htm">Ezra 4:11-16</a>; but the names of the writers are different from those mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a>. The three names, Bishlam, Mithredath, and Tabeel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a>), cannot be identified with the two names Rehum and Shimshai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a>). When we consider, however, that the writers named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a> were high officials of the Persian king, sending to the monarch a written accusation against the Jews in their own and their associates' names, it requires but little stretch of the imagination to suppose that these personages were acting at the instance of the adversaries named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a>, the Samaritans Bishlam, Mithredath, and Tabeel, and merely inditing the complaints raised by these opponents against the Jews. This view, which is not opposed by the &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a>, - this word not necessarily implying an autograph, - commends itself to our acceptance, first, because the notion that the contents of this letter are not given finds no analogy in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-6.htm">Ezra 4:6</a>, where the contents of the letter to Ahashverosh are sufficiently hinted at by the word &#1513;&#1474;&#1496;&#1504;&#1492;; while, with regard to the letter of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a>, we should have not a notion of its purport in case it were not the same which is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a>, etc.<p>(Note: The weight of this argument is indirectly admitted by Ewald (Gesch. iv. p. 119) and Bertheau, inasmuch as both suppose that there is a long gap in the narrative, and regard the Aramaean letter mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a> to have been a petition, on the part of persons of consideration in the community at Jerusalem, to the new king, - two notions which immediately betray themselves to be the expedients of perplexity. The supposed "long gaps, which the chronicler might well leave even in transcribing from his documents" (Ew.), do not explain the abrupt commencement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a>. If a petition from the Jewish community to the king were spoken of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a>, the accusation against the Jews in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a> would certainly have been alluded to by at least a &#1493; adversative, or some other adversative particle.)<p>Besides, the statement concerning the Aramaean composition of this letter would have been utterly purposeless if the Aramaean letter following in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a> had been an entirely different one. The information concerning the language in which the letter was written has obviously no other motive than to introduce its transcription in the original Aramaean. This conjecture becomes a certainty through the fact that the Aramaean letter follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a> without a copula of any kind. If any other had been intended, the &#1493; copulative would not more have been omitted here than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a>. The letter itself, indeed, does not begin till <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9</a>, while <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-8.htm">Ezra 4:8</a> contains yet another announcement of it. This circumstance, however, is explained by the fact that the writers of the letters are other individuals than those named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a>, but chiefly by the consideration that the letter, together with the king's answer, being derived from an Aramaean account of the building of the temple, the introduction to the letter found therein was also transcribed.</body></html>
