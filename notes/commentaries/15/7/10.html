To attain to the knowledge of it, that he might be master of it, and expert in it, and know what was not to be done, and what to be done; he had set his heart upon this, bent his studies this way, and taken a great deal of pains in searching into it, in reading of it, and meditating on it: <p>and to do it; he was not only concerned to get the theory of it, but to put it in practice, to exercise himself in it, that it might be habitual to him; and the rather, as his view and intentions were not merely for the sake of himself, but <p>to teach in Israel statutes and judgments: and therefore it was not only necessary that he should have a large and competent knowledge of the laws, moral, ceremonial, and civil, but that he should act according to them himself, that so by his example, as well as by his instructions, he might teach the people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezra/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezra/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">For Ezra had prepared</span> (R.V. <span class="bld">set</span>) <span class="ital">his heart</span> &c.] The precise meaning of the ‘for’ which determines the connexion of the verse, is not very evident. The verse <span class="ital">either</span> explains the preceding clause and attributes God’s favour towards Ezra during the journey to the latter’s devotion to the Divine Law, <span class="ital">or</span> is added as a general comment on the whole preceding section, explanatory of Ezra’s resolve and expedition. Those who take the former view illustrate it by ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/8-31.htm" title="Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way....">Ezra 8:31-32</a>. But the latter interpretation of the verse is to be preferred. It corresponds better with the somewhat abrupt mention of Ezra’s rule of life. It harmonizes with the description of Ezra’s character. ‘Ezra had set his heart &c.’ That fact lay at the bottom of the religious movement which he set on foot. It explained something very much more than the mere fortunate issue of the journey.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Had set his heart’. A not uncommon phrase, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-14.htm" title="And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.">2 Chronicles 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-3.htm" title="Nevertheless there are good things found in you, in that you have taken away the groves out of the land, and have prepared your heart to seek God.">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-19.htm" title="That prepares his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.">2 Chronicles 30:19</a>. In every instance the R.V. has rightly changed ‘prepare his heart’ to ‘set his heart’. The idea of the original is not ‘preparedness for the unforeseen’, but ‘fixity and stability of purpose’. Compare the expression ‘my heart is fixed’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-7.htm" title="My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise.">Psalm 57:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/108-1.htm" title="O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.">Psalm 108:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/112-7.htm" title="He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.">Psalm 112:7</a>) where the same verb occurs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to seek the law of the Lord</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-45.htm" title="And I will walk at liberty: for I seek your precepts.">Psalm 119:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-155.htm" title="Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not your statutes.">Psalm 119:155</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-8.htm" title="Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that you may possess this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.">1 Chronicles 28:8</a>. The search, no mere investigation of the letter, but for the sake of ascertaining the true principles of practical life embodied in the law, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-4.htm" title="And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.">2 Chronicles 14:4</a> ‘(Asa) commanded Judah to <span class="ital">seek</span> the Lord the God of their fathers, and to <span class="ital">do</span> the law and the commandment’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and to teach</span>] Those principles are self-diffusive, the teaching by example as much as by precept, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-9.htm" title="And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.">2 Chronicles 17:9</a> ‘And they (the priests) taught in Judah, having the book of the law with them’. Ezra’s purpose to <span class="ital">search</span> for truth, to <span class="ital">live</span> by it and to <span class="ital">teach</span> it his countrymen is an epitome of the ideal scribe’s career. We may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-1.htm" title="The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,">Acts 1:1</a> ‘All that Jesus began both to <span class="ital">do</span> and to <span class="ital">teach</span>’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">statutes and judgments</span>] These words in the Hebrew are singular, and are rendered ‘a statute and an ordinance’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-25.htm" title="And he cried to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,">Exodus 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-25.htm" title="So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.">Joshua 24:25</a>, where they are found together. The singular is generic.

The phrase is however used very generally without any close distinction in the shades of meaning.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Ezra had prepared his heart,</span> etc. God's favour towards Ezra, and the prosperous issue of his journey, were the consequences of his having set his heart on learning God's will, and doing it, and teaching it to others. <span class="cmt_word">To seek the law</span> is to aim at obtaining a complete knowledge of it. <span class="cmt_word">To teach statutes and judgments</span> is to inculcate both the ceremonial and the moral precepts.

Of this character were - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> the permission accorded to all Persian subjects of Israelite descent to accompany Ezra to Jerusalem (ver. 13); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> the commission to Ezra to convey to Jerusalem certain offerings made by the king and his chief courtiers to the God of Israel (vers. 15, 19); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> the permission given him to convey to Jerusalem the free-will offerings of Jews and others resident in Babylonia (ver. 16); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> permission to Ezra to draw on the royal treasury to the amount of a hundred talents of silver, a hundred measures of wheat, a hundred "baths" of wine, a hundred "baths" of oil, and salt to any amount (ver. 22); and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> an indefinite commission to "inquire" (ver. 14). Besides these temporary enactments, the decree contained certain provisions of a more permanent nature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Ezra was invested with the chief authority over the whole district "beyond the river," and was commissioned to appoint all the subordinate "magistrates and judges" (ver. 25). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He was authorised to enforce his decisions by the penalties of imprisonment, confiscation of goods, banishment, and even death itself (ver. 26). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> An exemption from taxation of every kind was granted to all grades of the sacerdotal order - to the priests, the Levites, the singers, the porters, the Nethinim, and the lowest grade of "ministers" - to all, in fact, who were engaged in the performance of any sacred function connected with the temple (ver. 24). This last provision was absolutely permanent, and probably continued in force down to the close of the empire. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>What follows is slightly combined with the former occurrences by the formula "after these things," without any more exact chronological definition; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>, and elsewhere. Between the dedication of the temple in the sixth year of Darius and the arrival of Ezra in Jerusalem, a period of fifty-seven years had elapsed. "In the reign of Artachshasta king of Persia, went up Ezra," etc. The verb of the subject &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1488; does not follow till <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>, where, after the interposition of the long genealogy, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1-5</a>, the distant subject is again taken up in &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1488; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;. It is all but universally agreed that Artaxerxes Longimanus is intended by &#1488;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;; the explanation of this appellation as Xerxes in Joseph. Antiq. xi. 5. 1, for which Fritzsche (on 1 Esdr. 8:1) has recently decided, being a mere conjecture on the part of that not very critical historian. The fact that the Artachshasta of the book of Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a>) can be no other than Artaxerxes, is decisive of this point: for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a> the thirty-second year of Artachshasta is mentioned; while according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-9.htm">Nehemiah 8:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-26.htm">Nehemiah 12:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-36.htm">Nehemiah 12:36</a>, Ezra and Nehemiah jointly exercised their respective offices at Jerusalem.<p>(Note: Very superficial are the arguments, and indeed the whole pamphlet, Etude Chronologique des livres d'Esdras et de Nhmie, Paris 1868, p. 40, etc., by which F. de Saulcy tries to show that the Artachshasta of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7.htm">Ezra 7</a> and of Nehemiah is Artaxerxes II((Mnemon).)<p>Ezra is called Ben Seraiah, whose pedigree is traced to Eleazar the son of Aaron; Seraiah the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, was the father of Josedec the high priest carried into captivity (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-14.htm">1 Chronicles 6:14</a>, etc.), and was himself the high priest whom Nebuchadnezzar slew at Riblah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18-21</a>). Between the execution of Seraiah in the year 588 and the return of Ezra from Babylon in 458 b.c., there is a period of 130 years. Hence Ezra could have been neither the son nor grandson of Seraiah, but only his great or great-great-grandson. When we consider that Joshua, or Jeshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>), the high priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel, was the grandson of Seraiah, we cannot but regard Ezra, who returned thence 78 years later, as a great-great-grandson of Seraiah. Moreover, we are justified in inferring from the fact that Ezra is not, like Joshua, designated as Ben Josedech, that he did not descend from that line of Seraiah in which the high-priestly dignity was hereditary, but from a younger son, and hence that his immediate ancestors were not (though his forefathers from Seraiah upwards were) of high-priestly descent. Hence the names of Ezra's ancestors from Seraiah up to Aaron (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1-5</a>) agree also with the genealogy of the high-priestly race (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4-14</a>), with the one deviation that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-3.htm">Ezra 7:3</a>, between Azariah and Meraioth, six members are passed over, as is frequently the case in the longer genealogies, for the sake of shortening the list of names. - In v. 6 Ezra, for the sake of at once alluding to the nature of his office, is designated &#1489;&#1514; &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512; &#1505;&#1493;&#1507; &#1512;, a scribe skilful in the law of Moses. The word &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; means in older works writer or secretary; but even so early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a> the lying pen of the &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is spoken of, and here therefore &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; has already attained the meaning of one learned in the Scripture, one who has made the written law a subject of investigation. Ezra is, however, the first of whom the predicate &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;, is used as a title. He is so called also in the letter of Artaxerxes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-11.htm">Ezra 7:11</a>), because he is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>) to have applied his heart to seek out and to do the law of the Lord, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgment, i.e., because he had made the investigation of the law, for the sake of introducing the practice of the same among the congregation, his life-task; and the king granted him all his desire, according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him.
