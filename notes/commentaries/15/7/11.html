She was become the best beloved of the king’s concubines, though not yet advanced to the dignity of queen; for, it being usual for the kings of Persia, on some particular days and occasions, to allow their women to ask what boons they pleased, it is not unlikely that, by the direction of Mordecai, upon some such occasion as this, Esther, though she had not discovered her kingdom and nation, might make this the matter of her request.” — Dodd.

According to others, who adopt a different chronology, it was more probably pressed upon the attention of the Persian court by Ezra, who, like Daniel, showed the prophecies to the king; or by some leading Jews on his accession, who, seeing the unsettled and disordered state of the colony after the deaths of Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Haggai, and Zechariah, recommended the appointment of a commission to reform abuses, suppress disorder, and enforce the observance of the law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A scribe of the words of the commandments, </span> the phrase seems emphatical, noting that he explained both the words and the things; for the Jews in the land of their captivity had in a great measure lost both their language, and the knowledge of God’s commands, and therefore Ezra and his companions instruct them in both; of which see more on <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-8.htm" title="So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.">Nehemiah 8:8</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now this is the copy of the letter that the King Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest,....

It is all but universally agreed that Artaxerxes Longimanus is intended by &#1488;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1514;&#1468;&#1488;; the explanation of this appellation as Xerxes in Joseph. Antiq. xi. 5. 1, for which Fritzsche (on 1 Esdr. 8:1) has recently decided, being a mere conjecture on the part of that not very critical historian. The fact that the Artachshasta of the book of Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a>) can be no other than Artaxerxes, is decisive of this point: for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a> the thirty-second year of Artachshasta is mentioned; while according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-9.htm">Nehemiah 8:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-26.htm">Nehemiah 12:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-36.htm">Nehemiah 12:36</a>, Ezra and Nehemiah jointly exercised their respective offices at Jerusalem.<p>(Note: Very superficial are the arguments, and indeed the whole pamphlet, Etude Chronologique des livres d'Esdras et de Nhmie, Paris 1868, p. 40, etc., by which F. de Saulcy tries to show that the Artachshasta of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7.htm">Ezra 7</a> and of Nehemiah is Artaxerxes II((Mnemon).)<p>Ezra is called Ben Seraiah, whose pedigree is traced to Eleazar the son of Aaron; Seraiah the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, was the father of Josedec the high priest carried into captivity (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-14.htm">1 Chronicles 6:14</a>, etc.), and was himself the high priest whom Nebuchadnezzar slew at Riblah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18-21</a>). Between the execution of Seraiah in the year 588 and the return of Ezra from Babylon in 458 b.c., there is a period of 130 years. Hence Ezra could have been neither the son nor grandson of Seraiah, but only his great or great-great-grandson. When we consider that Joshua, or Jeshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>), the high priest who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel, was the grandson of Seraiah, we cannot but regard Ezra, who returned thence 78 years later, as a great-great-grandson of Seraiah. Moreover, we are justified in inferring from the fact that Ezra is not, like Joshua, designated as Ben Josedech, that he did not descend from that line of Seraiah in which the high-priestly dignity was hereditary, but from a younger son, and hence that his immediate ancestors were not (though his forefathers from Seraiah upwards were) of high-priestly descent. Hence the names of Ezra's ancestors from Seraiah up to Aaron (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1-5</a>) agree also with the genealogy of the high-priestly race (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4-14</a>), with the one deviation that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-3.htm">Ezra 7:3</a>, between Azariah and Meraioth, six members are passed over, as is frequently the case in the longer genealogies, for the sake of shortening the list of names. - In v. 6 Ezra, for the sake of at once alluding to the nature of his office, is designated &#1489;&#1514; &#1502;&#1492;&#1497;&#1512; &#1505;&#1493;&#1507; &#1512;, a scribe skilful in the law of Moses. The word &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; means in older works writer or secretary; but even so early as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a> the lying pen of the &#1505;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is spoken of, and here therefore &#1505;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512; has already attained the meaning of one learned in the Scripture, one who has made the written law a subject of investigation. Ezra is, however, the first of whom the predicate &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1508;&#1512;, &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c2;, is used as a title. He is so called also in the letter of Artaxerxes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-11.htm">Ezra 7:11</a>), because he is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>) to have applied his heart to seek out and to do the law of the Lord, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgment, i.e., because he had made the investigation of the law, for the sake of introducing the practice of the same among the congregation, his life-task; and the king granted him all his desire, according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him.
