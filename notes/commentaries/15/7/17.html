The document describes, with great clearness and precision, the nature of Ezra's commission and the extent of power and prerogatives with which he was invested. It gave him authority, in the first place, to organize the colony in Judea and institute a regular government, according to the laws of the Hebrew people, and by magistrates and rulers of their own nation (Ezr 7:25, 26), with power to punish offenders by fines, imprisonment, exile, or death, according to the degree of their criminality. Secondly, he was empowered to carry a large donation in money, partly from the royal treasury and partly raised by voluntary contributions among his countrymen, to create a fund out of which to make suitable provision for maintaining the regular worship of God in Jerusalem (Ezr 7:16, 17). Thirdly, the Persian officers in Syria were commanded to afford him every assistance by gifts of money within a certain specified limit, in carrying out the objects of his patriotic mission (Ezr 7:21).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That thou mayest buy speedily with this money,....

The residue was, however, to be employed in any way that Ezra, acting under Divine guidance, might direct (see below, ver. 18). Apparently, this residue was actually employed on beautifying the temple (see ver. 27). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The commission given by Artachshasta to Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-11.htm">Ezra 7:11</a>), with a short postscript by Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-27.htm">Ezra 7:27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-28.htm">Ezra 7:28</a>). - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-11.htm">Ezra 7:11</a> The introductory title, "This is the copy of the letter," On &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1490;&#1503;, comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-11.htm">Ezra 4:11</a>, and on &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7</a>.
