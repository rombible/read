But the weapons of Christian ministers are not carnal. Faithful preaching, holy lives, fervent prayers, and patient suffering when called to it, are the means to bring men into obedience to Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The title, "king of kings," is assumed by almost all the persian monarchs in their inscriptions.<p>Perfect peace - "Peace" is not in the original, and the word translated "perfect" occurs only in this place.

Artaxerxes, king of kings&#8212;That title might have been assumed as, with literal truth, applicable to him, since many of the tributary princes of his empire still retained the name and authority of kings. But it was a probably a mere Orientalism, denoting a great and powerful prince, as the heaven of heavens signified the highest heaven, and vanity of vanities, the greatest vanity. This vainglorious title was assumed by the kings of Assyria, from whom it passed to the sovereigns of Persia.<p>unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven&#8212;The appointment of Ezra to this influential mission was of the highest importance to the Hebrew people, as a large proportion of them were become, in a great measure, strangers both to the language and the institutions of their forefathers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I make a decree,....

That Israelites of all the tribes actually went up to Jerusalem on the occasion seems indicated by the "twelve bullocks for <span class="accented">all</span> Israel," which those who returned with Ezra offered on their arrival to the "God of Israel" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With Ezra went up a number of Israelites, priests, and Levites. &#1502;&#1503; partitive: a part of the whole. That they went up with Ezra appears from the context, and is expressly stated both in the royal edict (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-13.htm">Ezra 7:13</a>) and in the further description of the expedition (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-28.htm">Ezra 7:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-1.htm">Ezra 8:1</a>). They went up in the seventh year of Artaxerxes, and reached Jerusalem in the fifth month of that year. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-8.htm">Ezra 7:8</a> Ezra is again, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>, the subject of the sentence; the intervening seventh verse being really only in apposition with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a> the time occupied by the journey is more precisely defined; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is explanatory. Namely, on the first day of the first month, he had appointed the journey from Babylon, etc. The Keri &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; can only mean, ipsum erat fundamentum profectionis, as J. H. Mich. after R. Sal. explains it, for &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; is pointed as the construct state. The departure of the expedition from the place of meeting occurred, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-31.htm">Ezra 8:31</a>, on the twelfth day of the first month. Since, however, they encamped three days there, making the final preparations for their journey, eleven days might easily elapse between the period when the whole caravan had assembled, and the day of actual departure. The Keri offers no appropriate signification; for since &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; can only be taken for the subject, and &#1492;&#1501; &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; for the predicate, the sentence would contain an anacoluthon. To translate &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; by ipsum cannot be justified by the usages of the language, for there is no such emphasis on &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; as to cause &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; to be regarded as an emphatic reference to the following noun. &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; must be pointed &#1497;&#1505;&#1491; or &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1491;, as the third pers. perf. Kal or Piel, meaning to arrange, to appoint, and &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; referred to Ezra. On &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>. The hand of his God graciously arranged for him, for he had prepared his heart to seek and to do the law of Jahve, i.e., to make the law of God his rule of action. &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1493; &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/12-14.htm">2 Chronicles 12:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-19.htm">2 Chronicles 30:19</a>.
