So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous the redemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear the gospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mourn for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we must ourselves be affected. It was carefully agreed how this affair should be carried on.

But as the weather was ungenial and the defaulters were too numerous to be passed in review at one time, it was resolved that a commission should be appointed to examine into the whole matter. These commissioners, assisted by the judges and elders of the respective cities, made a minute investigation into every case, and after three months' labor completely removed all traces of the abuse. Doubtless, an adequate provision was made for the repudiated wives and children, according to the means and circumstances of the husbands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Do his pleasure; </span> you have sinfully pleased yourselves, now please God by your obedience to his command. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now therefore make confession to the Lord God of your fathers,....

Or, <span class="ital">give thanks</span>) <span class="ital">unto the Lord, the God of your fathers</span>. ‘Make confession’. Literally ‘give thanksgiving or praise’. The substantive is connected with the verb which in its reflexive form means, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-1.htm" title="Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled to him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.">Ezra 10:1</a>, ‘made confession’. It is found elsewhere in these books (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm" title="And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.">Nehemiah 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-31.htm" title="Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate:">Nehemiah 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/12-38.htm" title="And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people on the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall;...">Nehemiah 12:38-40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-31.htm" title="Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.">2 Chronicles 29:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-16.htm" title="And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel.">2 Chronicles 33:16</a>) with the meaning of ‘thanksgiving’, which is the general sense of the word in other books (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/7-12.htm" title="If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried....">Leviticus 7:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-15.htm" title="And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.">Leviticus 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-7.htm" title="That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all your wondrous works.">Psalm 26:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42-4.htm" title="When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy day.">Psalm 42:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm" title="Offer to God thanksgiving; and pay your vows to the most High:">Psalm 50:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm" title="Whoever offers praise glorifies me: and to him that orders his conversation aright will I show the salvation of God.">Psalm 50:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/56-12.htm" title="Your vows are on me, O God: I will render praises to you.">Psalm 56:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/100-4.htm" title="Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful to him, and bless his name.">Psalm 100:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-22.htm" title="And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.">Psalm 107:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-17.htm" title="I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call on the name of the LORD.">Psalm 116:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-7.htm" title="Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise on the harp to our God:">Psalm 147:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-3.htm" title="For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.">Isaiah 51:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-26.htm" title="And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, to the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 17:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-19.htm" title="And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.">Jeremiah 30:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm" title="The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endures for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD.

The only possible exception is <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-19.htm" title="And Joshua said to Achan, My son, give, I pray you, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me now what you have done; hide it not from me.">Joshua 7:19</a> ‘My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession (marg. Or, <span class="ital">give praise</span>) unto him’. There, as in this passage, ‘make confession’ is a good paraphrase rather than a strict translation. ‘Praise’ was given to God by the utterance of confession. The penitent who renounced his sin and threw himself upon the mercies of God rendered that true praise of trust and love, from which ‘confession’ springs. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-23.htm" title="Whoever offers praise glorifies me: and to him that orders his conversation aright will I show the salvation of God.">Psalm 50:23</a> ‘Whoso offereth the sacrifice of <span class="ital">thanksgiving</span> glorifieth me’. On ‘the Lord, the God of your fathers’, see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-28.htm" title="And I said to them, You are holy to the LORD; the vessels are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD God of your fathers.">Ezra 8:28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and do his pleasure</span>] The words of praise to be verified in action.
