No interposition of civil authority was therefore needful to dissolve these marriages; the infidelity and idolatry of the party espoused were as much an interdiction as any the most proximate degree of consanguinity, which, by the laws of all civilized nations, is known to vacate the marriage. But even suppose the civil authority thought proper to interpose in this matter, yet wherein had the Jews any reason to complain, if, in just punishment of their wilful breach of a known and positive law, they were excluded from cohabiting with these illegal wives; those Jews, who, for every light and trivial cause, made no scruple to give even their lawful wives a bill of divorcement, and might, therefore, with much less difficulty, be supposed willing to repudiate those whom the laws of their God, for fear of their catching the infection of idolatry, had forbidden them to live with?” — Dodd. See Selden, <span class="ital">Uxor. Hebrews, </span>50:3, c. 18. It may be observed further here, that these wives and children were only cast out of the commonwealth of Israel, but were not utterly forsaken: probably care was taken by authority that they should have some provision made for them. For all was to be done according to the counsel of Ezra, and other good men, who feared God, and would not enjoin or advise any thing that was unjust or unmerciful. They would also probably take care that the children should be educated in the Jewish religion.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-5 Shechaniah owned the national guilt. The case is sad, but it is not desperate; the disease threatening, but not incurable. Now that the people begin to lament, a spirit of repentance seems to be poured out; now there is hope that God will forgive, and have mercy. The sin that rightly troubles us, shall not ruin us. In melancholy times we must observe what makes for us, as well as against us. And there may be good hopes through grace, even where there is the sense of great guilt before God. The case is plain; what has been done amiss, must be undone again as far as possible; nothing less than this is true repentance. Sin must be put away, with a resolution never to have any thing more to do with it. What has been unjustly got, must be restored. Arise, be of good courage. Weeping, in this case, is good, but reforming is better. As to being unequally yoked with unbelievers, such marriages, it is certain, are sinful, and ought not to be made; but now they are not null, as they were before the gospel did away the separation between Jews and Gentiles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let it be done according to the law - i. e., let a formal "bill of divorcement" be given to each foreign wife, whereby she will be restored to the condition of an unmarried woman, and be free to marry another husband (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-2</a>). The facility of divorce among the Jews is well-known. According to many of the rabbis, a bill of divorcement might he given by the husband for the most trivial cause. Thus, no legal difficulty stood in the way of Shechaniah's proposition; and Ezra regarded it as necessary for the moral and religious welfare of the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-4.

He spoke in the general name of the people, and his conduct evinced a tender conscience, as well as no small fortitude in making such a proposal; for as his father and five paternal uncles (Ezr 10:26) were involved in the guilt of unlawful marriages, he showed, by the measure he recommended, that he deemed it better to obey God than to please his nearest relatives.<p>yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing&#8212;This hope, however, depended on timely measures of reformation, and therefore, instead of surrendering themselves to despair or despondency, he counselled them to amend their error without delay, relying on God's mercy for the past. Though the proposal may seem harsh and cruel, yet in the peculiar circumstances of the Jews it was just as well as necessary; and he urged the duty of seeing it executed on Ezra, as the only person competent to carry it into effect, being possessed of skill and address for so delicate and difficult a work, and invested by God, and under Him by the Persian king (Ezr 7:23-28), with the requisite authority to enforce it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To put away all the wives; </span> which though it may seem harsh, yet is not unjust, if it be considered, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That marriages made between some prohibited persons; as suppose, between a father and his daughter, a brother and a sister, are not only unlawful, but void marriages, and <span class="ital">ipso facto</span> null, by the political laws of civil nations. And therefore these marriages with idolatrous and heathen women, being expressly and severely forbidden by God, might well be disannulled. And it was one of good Theodosius’s laws, that those actions which were done against law, should be accounted not only unlawful, but null. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

This may seem to have been a necessary part of severity, partly, as a proper punishment of the parents’ sin herein, and to deter others more effectually from the like practices; partly, to prevent the corruption of their other children by the conversation and society of this ungodly and idolatrous brood; and partly, lest such children, being continually present with them, and stealing into their affections, might at last prevail with them to take their ejected wives again. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. These children were only cast out of the families and commonwealth of Israel, but were not utterly forsaken and ruined; but due care was probably taken by authority that they should have some provision made for them, and some care taken about their education in the Jewish religion, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">According to the counsel of my lord; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The marriages had been valid, but were now declared sinful. The method of separation was forcible expulsion. The case of the wives and of their children, who had become ‘proselytes’ and embraced the Israelite religion, is not taken into account. The words ‘and such as are born of them’ probably refer to the children of tender years.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to the counsel of my lord</span>] so R.V. text: R.V. Marg. Or, ‘<span class="ital">the Lord</span>’. The Hebrew text is ‘Adonai’, ‘my Lord’, and the Vulgate accordingly renders ‘juxta voluntatem Domini’. It is objected, (1) that the word ‘counsel’ (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-8.htm" title="And that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.">Ezra 10:8</a>) seems in this context to imply human counsel, as generally. (2) Used of the Divine purpose, it is found chiefly in poetry and prophecy (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-11.htm" title="The counsel of the LORD stands for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.">Psalm 33:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-19.htm" title="That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!">Isaiah 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-17.htm" title="And the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt, every one that makes mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he has determined against it.">Isaiah 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-20.htm" title="Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he has taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.">Jeremiah 49:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-45.htm" title="Therefore hear you the counsel of the LORD, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.">Jeremiah 50:45</a>). (3) The name ‘Adonai’ (Lord) as a Divine title only occurs elsewhere in these books, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-11.htm" title="O LORD, I beseech you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.">Nehemiah 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-14.htm" title="And I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not you afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.">Nehemiah 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-10.htm" title="Then he said to them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy to our LORD: neither be you sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.">Nehemiah 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-30.htm" title="And that we would not give our daughters to the people of the land, not take their daughters for our sons:">Nehemiah 10:30</a>. (4) The expression ‘the counsel of the Lord and of those that tremble at the word of God’ is harsh. The rendering ‘my lord’ requires us to read ‘Adoni’, a very slight change. This was apparently read by the LXX. and by 1 Esdr., where there is no mention of the Divine name. The application of the title ‘my lord’ to Ezra is peculiar (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-5.htm" title="And next to them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their LORD.">Nehemiah 3:5</a>), and the allusion to his ‘counsel’, which can only refer to the substance of Ezra’s prayer, is not very natural. It is not easy to decide between the two readings. On the whole the R.V. text rendering is to be preferred. The tendency of Jewish scribes would be rather to introduce the Divine Name, if it was not in the text, than to alter it, if it was in the text, into a common word: and this tendency would be assisted, in this case, by the use of ‘Adonai’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-11.htm" title="O LORD, I beseech you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.">Nehemiah 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-14.htm" title="And I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not you afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.">Nehemiah 4:14</a>. If the rendering of the R.V. marg. be adopted, then the ‘counsel of the Lord’ will refer to the teaching of the law. The combination of the Divine name ‘with those who trembled at the commandment of our God’ may be paralleled by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-14.htm" title="And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built, and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.">Ezra 6:14</a>, or <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm" title="For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things;">Acts 15:28</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of those that tremble at</span> &c.] Cf. note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-4.htm" title="Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.">Ezra 9:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and let it be done according to the law</span>] or ‘and according to the law it shall be done’. The clause is not very definitely expressed. And it has been differently understood to mean either that the general law forbidding marriage with the heathen should now be observed, or that this particular act of ‘putting away the strange wives’ should be performed in accordance with the regulations for divorce contained in the law (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house....">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore let us make a covenant.</span> Shechaniah had probably in his thoughts the (comparatively) recent covenant which the people had made in the reign of Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-15.htm">Jeremiah 34:15</a>) on the subject of releasing their Hebrew slaves after six years of servitude.

And now give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons (for wives), nor seek their peace nor their wealth for ever; that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever." The words of the prophets introduced by &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; are found in these terms neither in the prophetical books nor the Pentateuch. They are not, therefore, to be regarded as a verbal quotation, but only as a declaration that the prohibition of intermarriage with the heathen had been inculcated by the prophets. The introduction of this prohibition by the words: the land unto which ye go to possess it, refers to the Mosaic age, and in using it Ezra had chiefly in view <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-3</a>. He interweaves, however, with this passage other sayings from the Pentateuch, e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-7.htm">Deuteronomy 23:7</a>, and from the prophetic writings, without designing to make a verbal quotation. He says quite generally, by His servants the prophets, as the author of the books of Kings does in similar cases, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-23.htm">2 Kings 17:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-10.htm">2 Kings 21:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>, where the leading idea is, not to give the saying of some one prophet, but to represent the truth in question as one frequently reiterated. The sayings of Moses in Deuteronomy also bear a prophetical character; for in this book he, after the manner of the prophets, seeks to make the people lay to heart the duty of obeying the law. It is true that we do not meet in the other books of Scripture a special prohibition of marriages with Canaanites, though in the prophetical remarks, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-6.htm">Judges 3:6</a>, such marriages are reproved as occasions of seducing the Israelites to idolatry, and in the prophetic descriptions of the whoredoms of Israel with Baalim, and the general animadversions upon apostasy from the Lord, the transgression of this prohibition is implicitly included; thus justifying the general expression, that God had forbidden the Israelites to contract such marriages, by His servants the prophets. Besides, we must here take into consideration the threatening of the prophets, that the Lord would thrust Israel out of the land for their sins, among which intermarriage with the Canaanites was by no means the least. Ezra, moreover, makes use of the general expression, "by the prophets," because he desired to say that God had not merely forbidden these marriages one or twice in the law, but had also repeatedly inculcated this prohibition by the prophets. The law was preached by the prophets when they reiterated what was the will of God as revealed in the law of Moses. In this respect Ezra might well designate the prohibition of the law as the saying of the prophets, and cite it as pronounced according to the circumstances of the Mosaic period.<p>(Note: It is hence evident that these words of Ezra afford no evidence against the single authorship of the Pentateuch. The inference that a saying of the law, uttered during the wanderings in the wilderness, is here cited as a saying of the prophets the servants of Jahve, is, according to the just remark of Bertheau, entirely refuted even by the fact that the words cited are nowhere found in the Pentateuch in this exact form, and that hence Ezra did not intend to make a verbal quotation.)<p>The words: the land into which ye go, etc., recall the introduction of the law in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>, etc.; but the description of the land as a land of uncleanness through the uncleanness of the people, etc., does not read thus either in the Pentateuch or in the prophets. &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492;, the uncleanness of women, is first applied to moral impurity by the prophets: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-17.htm">Lamentations 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-20.htm">Ezekiel 7:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-5.htm">Isaiah 64:5</a>. The expression &#1502;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, from edge to edge, i.e., from one end to the other, like &#1500;&#1508;&#1492; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-21.htm">2 Kings 10:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>, is taken from vessels filled to their upper rim. &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; introduces the consequence: and now, this being the case.
