The case is sad, but it is not desperate; the disease threatening, but not incurable. Now that the people begin to lament, a spirit of repentance seems to be poured out; now there is hope that God will forgive, and have mercy. The sin that rightly troubles us, shall not ruin us. In melancholy times we must observe what makes for us, as well as against us. And there may be good hopes through grace, even where there is the sense of great guilt before God. The case is plain; what has been done amiss, must be undone again as far as possible; nothing less than this is true repentance. Sin must be put away, with a resolution never to have any thing more to do with it. What has been unjustly got, must be restored. Arise, be of good courage. Weeping, in this case, is good, but reforming is better. As to being unequally yoked with unbelievers, such marriages, it is certain, are sinful, and ought not to be made; but now they are not null, as they were before the gospel did away the separation between Jews and Gentiles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let it be done according to the law - i. e., let a formal "bill of divorcement" be given to each foreign wife, whereby she will be restored to the condition of an unmarried woman, and be free to marry another husband (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-2</a>). The facility of divorce among the Jews is well-known. According to many of the rabbis, a bill of divorcement might he given by the husband for the most trivial cause. Thus, no legal difficulty stood in the way of Shechaniah's proposition; and Ezra regarded it as necessary for the moral and religious welfare of the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-8. Then Ezra &#8230; went into the chamber of Johanan&#8212;At a private council of the princes and elders held there, under the presidency of Ezra, it was resolved to enter into a general covenant to put away their foreign wives and children; that a proclamation should be made for all who had returned from Babylon to repair within three days to Jerusalem, under pain of excommunication and confiscation of their property.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then arose Ezra,....

Cf. ‘the chiefs of the priests’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm" title="Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>), ‘the chiefs of the Levites’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-9.htm" title="Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave to the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five hundred oxen.">2 Chronicles 35:9</a>), ‘the princes (or chiefs) of Judah’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-31.htm" title="Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate:">Nehemiah 12:31</a>), ‘the princes of the people’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm" title="And the rulers of the people dwelled at Jerusalem: the rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other cities.">Nehemiah 11:1</a>). The rendering of the LXX. (<span class="greekheb">ὥρκισε τοὺς ἄρχοντας τοὺς ἱερεῖς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.) seems to make ‘the princes’ or chiefs a separate class from the priests and the Levites.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ezra’s policy was at once to bind to his side the leaders of the people. By administering to them the oath of cooperation in the work of reform, while public feeling was still intensely aroused, he secured from them a public assurance of support. After that, they could not well recede from their oath. If they did not second his efforts, their hands were effectually tied. In dealing with a community which was to all intents and purposes a religious oligarchy, to compromise the chiefs or princes in his favour was the first and surest step to a successful result.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to this word</span>] i.e. Shecaniah’s proposal that the people should put away from them the foreign women, whom they had married.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests...  to swear</span>.

Matters having reached this point, the covenant having been made, and the only question remaining for consideration being how the decision come to should be carried out, Ezra "rose up," and withdrew himself for a time from the people, entering into one of the side chambers of the temple, and secluding himself there. The guilt of his brethren still pressed heavily on his spirit, and he continued the mourning which he had commenced as soon as it came to his ears. To this mourning he now joined a fast of the strictest kind, an entire abstinence both from eating and drinking, like that of Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>). Natural piety seems to have taught men generally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-7</a>), and the Jews among them, that such abstinence was a fitting accompaniment of penitential prayer, and might be counted on to lend it additional force with Almighty God. Compare the private and personal fasts of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16</a>), Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>), Daniel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>), and Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And after all, continues Ezra, taking up again the &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-10.htm">Ezra 9:10</a>, - "after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass - yea, Thou our God has spared us more than our iniquity deserved, and hast given us this escaped remnant - can we again break Thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? Wilt Thou not be angry with us even to extirpation, so that no residue and no escaped remnant should be left?" The premiss in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a> is followed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm">Ezra 9:14</a> by the conclusion in the form of a question, while the second clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a> is an explanatory parenthesis. Bertheau construes the passage otherwise. He finds the continuation of the sentence: and after all this ... in the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, which, calmly spoken, would read: Thou, O God, hast not wholly destroyed us, but hast preserved to us an escaped remnant; while instead of such a continuation we have an exclamation of grateful wonder, emphatically introduced by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in the sense of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501;. With this construction of the clauses, however, no advance is made, and Ezra, in this prayer, does but repeat what he had already said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-9.htm">Ezra 9:9</a>; although the introductory &#1488;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497; leads us to expect a new thought to close the confession. Then, too, the logical connection between the question <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm">Ezra 9:14</a> and what precedes it would be wanting, i.e., a foundation of fact for the question <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm">Ezra 9:14</a>. Bertheau remarks on <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm">Ezra 9:14</a>, that the question: should we return to break (i.e., break again) the commands of God? is an antithesis to the exclamation. But neither does this question, to judge by its matter, stand in contrast to the exclamation, nor is any such contrast indicated by its form. The discourse advances in regular progression only when <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm">Ezra 9:14</a> forms the conclusion arrived at from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>, and the thought in the premiss (13a) is limited by the thoughts introduced with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. What had come upon Israel for their sins was, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-7.htm">Ezra 9:7</a>, deliverance into the hand of heathen kings, to the sword, to captivity, etc. God had not, however, merely chastened and punished His people for their sins, He had also extended mercy to them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>, etc. This, therefore, is also mentioned by Ezra in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>, to justify, or rather to limit, the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; in &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is properly confirmatory: for Thou, our God, hast indeed punished us, but not in such measure as our sins had deserved; and receives through the tenor of the clause the adversative meaning of imo, yea (comp. Ewald, 330, b). &#1500;&#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1502; &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;, Thou hast checked, hast stopped, beneath our iniquities. &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498; is not used intransitively, but actively; the missing object must be supplied from the context: Thou hast withheld that, all of which should have come upon us, i.e., the punishment we deserved, or, as older expositors completed the sense, iram tuam. &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, infra delicta nostra, i.e., Thou hast punished us less than our iniquities deserved. For their iniquities they had merited extirpation; but God had given them a rescued remnant. &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, as this, viz., this which exists in the community now returned from Babylon to Judaea. This is the circumstance which justifies the question: should we, or can we, again (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; is used adverbially) break Thy commandments, and become related by marriage? (&#1495;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;   like <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>.) &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, people who live in abominations. The answer to this question is found in the subsequent question: will He not - if, after the sparing mercy we have experienced, we again transgress the commands of God - by angry with us till He have consumed us? &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1491; (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-17.htm">2 Kings 13:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-19.htm">2 Kings 13:19</a>) is strengthened by the addition: so that there will be no remnant and no escaping. The question introduced by &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; is an expression of certain assurance: He will most certainly consume us.</body></html>
