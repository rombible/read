And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They gave their hands - i. e., "solemnly pledged themselves" (compare the marginal references).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. they gave their hands&#8212;that is, came under a solemn engagement, which was usually ratified by pledging the right hand (Pr 6:1; Eze 17:18).

The sacrifice of a ram for a guilt offering is enjoined, ‘if anyone commit a trespass and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of the Lord’ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/5-14.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Leviticus 5:14-19</a>). There is however no real reason for limiting the guilt offering to the priests. The passage from Leviticus makes no such restriction. It is probable that this verse represents the form of solemn renunciation imposed upon all the offenders, i.e. the promise and the guilt offering. It is mentioned after the first names on the list, and should be understood after each recorded group of names. The repetition of the formula was considered unnecessary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>being <span class="ital">guilty</span>] These words sound like the sentence of the commission, after investigating each case.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">20, 21, 22.</span> The sons of Immer, Harim and Pashur.

It is not clear whether this is intended to be said of Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah only, or of the entire body of persons found guilty of having married strange wives.
