After sixty days contumacy, the anathema or execration followed, which, however, was rescinded upon repentance: nevertheless, it was not allowable for any one to kill the person under such an anathema, but he might be supported in a tent or cottage entirely separated from all society.” See Dodd.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:6-14 There is hope concerning people, when they are convinced, not only that it is good to part with their sins, but that it is necessary; we must do it, or we are undone. So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous the redemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear the gospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mourn for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we must ourselves be affected. It was carefully agreed how this affair should be carried on.

The mention of Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-28.htm" title="The men of Bethel and Ai, two hundred twenty and three.">Ezra 2:28</a>), Lod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-33.htm" title="The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and five.">Ezra 2:33</a>), and Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-34.htm" title="The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.">Ezra 2:34</a>) as some of the most distant towns belonging to the Jews, shows that the requirement to be in Jerusalem within three days made no impossible demand upon the powers of an ordinarily active man.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to the counsel of the princes and the elders</span>] The real administrative body in Jerusalem. The representatives of the chief households and families. On the elders cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-5.htm" title="But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.">Ezra 5:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all his substance should be forfeited</span>] R.V. marg. Heb. <span class="ital">devoted</span>. A man’s substance is his possessions, ‘goods’. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-4.htm" title="And whoever remains in any place where he sojournes, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:4</a>. The first part of the penalty was confiscation of property and the appropriation of the money, realized from its sale, by the Temple treasury. On ‘devotion’ (ḥerem) see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD....">Leviticus 27:28-29</a>. In early times ‘devotion’ was tantamount to ‘destruction’ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm" title="He that sacrifices to any god, save to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.">Exodus 22:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/7-1.htm" title="But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel....">Joshua 7:1-26</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-8.htm" title="And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.">1 Samuel 15:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-33.htm" title="And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.

To be separated from the congregation was no mere decree of banishment. A man with such a sentence was to be outlawed and disowned by his own race. The community was a religious one.

We will now make a covenant with God to put away all the strange wives and their children from the congregation, according to the counsel of the Lord, and of those who fear the commandment of our God, that it may be done according to the law." Shecaniah, of the sons of Elam (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-7.htm">Ezra 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-7.htm">Ezra 8:7</a>), is a different person from the descendant of Zattu, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-5.htm">Ezra 8:5</a>; nor is Jehiel identical with the individual whose name occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-26.htm">Ezra 10:26</a>. &#1493;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, and have brought home strange wives. &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to cause to dwell (in one's house), said in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-10.htm">Ezra 10:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-14.htm">Ezra 10:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-17.htm">Ezra 10:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-27.htm">Nehemiah 13:27</a>, of bringing a wife home. Shecaniah founds his hope for Israel in this trespass upon the circumstance, that they bind themselves by a solemn covenant before God to put away this scandal from the congregation, and to act in conformity with the law. To make a covenant with our God, i.e., to bind themselves by an oath with respect to God, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-10.htm">2 Chronicles 29:10</a>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;, to put away - the opposite of &#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;. All the wives are, according to the context, all the strange women (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-2.htm">Ezra 10:2</a>), and that which is born of them, their children. Instead of &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1514;, according to the counsel of the Lord, De Wette, Bertheau, and others, following the paraphrase in the lxx and 1 Esdras, read &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;, according to the counsel of my lord, i.e., of Ezra. But this paraphrase being of no critical authority, there is no sufficient reason for the alteration. For Shecaniah to call Ezra my lord sounds strange, since usually this title was only given by servants to their master, or subjects to their sovereign, and Shecaniah afterwards addresses him simply as thou. Besides, Ezra had given no advice at all in this matter, and still less had he come to any resolution about it with the God-fearing members of the community. &#1497;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; after the preceding &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, we will make a covenant, must be taken as hortative: and let it be done according to the law. &#1489;&#1468; &#1495;&#1512;&#1491;, caring for with trembling. </body></html>
