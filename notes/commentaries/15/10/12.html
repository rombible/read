So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous the redemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear the gospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mourn for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we must ourselves be affected. It was carefully agreed how this affair should be carried on. That which is hastily resolved on seldom proves lasting.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was the ninth month - Or, our December, a time when rain fails heavily in Palestine: four months, therefore, after Ezra's arrival in Jerusalem (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>).<p>The street - Rather, "the court," the "broad," "spacious, place" (compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-17. Ezra the priest stood up, and said&#8212;Having fully represented the enormity of their sin and urged them to dissolve their unlawful connections, he was gratified by receiving a prompt acknowledgment of the justice of his reproof and a promise of compliance with his recommendation. But as the weather was ungenial and the defaulters were too numerous to be passed in review at one time, it was resolved that a commission should be appointed to examine into the whole matter. These commissioners, assisted by the judges and elders of the respective cities, made a minute investigation into every case, and after three months' labor completely removed all traces of the abuse. Doubtless, an adequate provision was made for the repudiated wives and children, according to the means and circumstances of the husbands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,....

The substance of their decision is here paraphrased. The method of its expression was probably by unanimous acclamation. We can hardly suppose that there was free discussion. The princes debated and harangued the multitude: the multitude listened and expressed disapproval or approbation by cries and shouting.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>with <span class="ital">a loud voice</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-12.htm" title="But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:">Ezra 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-23.htm" title="And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.">2 Samuel 15:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">As thou hast said, so must we do</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">As thou hast said concerning us, so must we do.</span> R.V. marg. ‘<span class="ital">As thou hast said, so it behoveth us to do</span>’. Literally the clause runs ‘According to thy word (or words) upon us to do’. It is a disputed point whether ‘upon us’ is to be taken with what precedes or with what follows, i.e. ‘according to thy word respecting us, it is necessary to do’ or ‘according to thy word, it falls upon us to do’. (<span class="ital">a</span>) The rendering of the R.V. text is that of the Vulgate ‘juxta verbum tuum ad nos, sic fiat’, and is supported by the traditional Jewish interpretation supplied by the Hebrew accents. The sentence is then clearly greatly condensed, and although the construction of the verb ‘to do’ is very harsh, the meaning is clear. (<span class="ital">b</span>) As however the rest of the people’s reply shows no symptom of such compression, the alternative explanation of the rendering in the margin seems preferable. The use of the preposition ‘upon’, with a sense of ‘duty’ or ‘obligation’ occurred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-4.htm" title="Arise; for this matter belongs to you: we also will be with you: be of good courage, and do it.">Ezra 10:4</a>.

A general assent to Ezra’s proposal. The time of the year and the magnitude of the task make it necessary to appoint a commission to carry it into execution.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Hereupon Ezra left the place before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib, to fast and mourn there for the unfaithfulness (transgression) of them that had been carried away (&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; like <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-4.htm">Ezra 9:4</a>). Johanan the son of Eliashib cannot actually be Johanan ben Eliashib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-23.htm">Nehemiah 12:23</a>) the high priest, however natural it may be to understand by the chamber of Johanan one of the chambers in the out-buildings of the temple, called after the name of some well-known individual. For the high priest Eliashib was a contemporary of Nehemiah, and the high priest Johanan was not the son, but, according to the definite statement, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10</a>, the grandson, of Eliashib, and the son of Joiada (the correct reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-11.htm">Nehemiah 12:11</a> being: Joiada begat Johanan and Jonathan). Now a chamber of the temple could not in Ezra's time have been as yet called after a grandson of Eliashib the contemporary of Nehemiah; <p>(Note: This would not, indeed, be impossible, because, as we shall subsequently show (in our Introduction to the book of Nehemiah, 2), Eliashib's grandson Johanan might be already ten years of age at the time of the transaction in question; so that his grandfather, the high priest Eliashib, might have called a chamber of the temple after the name of his grandson. This view is not, however, a very probable one.)<p>and both Johanan and Eliashib being names which frequently occur (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-24.htm">Ezra 10:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-27.htm">Ezra 10:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-36.htm">Ezra 10:36</a>), and one of the twenty-four orders of priests being called after the latter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-12.htm">1 Chronicles 24:12</a>), we, with Ewald (Gesch. iv. p. 228), regard the Johanan ben Eliashib here mentioned as an individual of whom nothing further is known-perhaps a priest descended from the Eliashib of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-12.htm">1 Chronicles 24:12</a>, and who possessed in the new temple a chamber called by his name. For there is not the slightest reason to suppose, with Bertheau, that a subsequent name of this chamber is used in this narrative, because the narrator desired to state the locality in a manner which should be intelligible to his contemporaries. Cler. and Berth. desire, after 1 Esdr. 9:1((&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;), to change &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; into &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1500;&#1503;: and he passed the night there without eating bread or drinking water. But the lxx having &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;, and the repetition of the same word being, moreover, by no means infrequent, comp. e.g., &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-5.htm">Ezra 10:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a>, and finally &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; repeatedly standing for thither, e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-14.htm">1 Samuel 2:14</a> (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;), there are no adequate grounds for an alteration of the text. The paraphrase of 1 Esdr. arises merely from the connection, and is devoid of critical value. To eat no bread, etc., means to fast: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>. </body></html>
