And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled.

Ezra the priest stood up, and said&#8212;Having fully represented the enormity of their sin and urged them to dissolve their unlawful connections, he was gratified by receiving a prompt acknowledgment of the justice of his reproof and a promise of compliance with his recommendation. But as the weather was ungenial and the defaulters were too numerous to be passed in review at one time, it was resolved that a commission should be appointed to examine into the whole matter. These commissioners, assisted by the judges and elders of the respective cities, made a minute investigation into every case, and after three months' labor completely removed all traces of the abuse. Doubtless, an adequate provision was made for the repudiated wives and children, according to the means and circumstances of the husbands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Were separated, </span> i.e. sequestered themselves from all other business, and gave themselves wholly to this. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of the captivity did so,....

The Commission at work<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">the children of the captivity did so</span>] For this expression cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-7.htm" title="And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;">Ezra 10:7</a>. The proposal was no sooner made than it was carried into execution. The personal influence of Ezra must account for the ready acquiescence of the people generally.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And Ezra the priest</span>] Ezra is here mentioned first, and it is probable that he presided over the court of enquiry. On his title ‘the priest’, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-11.htm" title="Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel.">Ezra 7:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers</span>] R.V. with <span class="bld">certain heads of fathers’</span> houses, <span class="bld">after their fathers’ houses.</span> The word ‘with’ does not appear in the Hebrew, but, if the existing text be correct, we clearly need some such copula, which is supplied in the LXX. and Vulg. The phrase ‘certain heads of fathers’ houses, after their fathers’ houses’ seems to mean that each ‘father’s house’ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-3.htm" title="The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two.">Ezra 2:3</a>, &c.) was represented on the commission by its chief or head. Literally rendered, the Hebrew runs, ‘Ezra the priest, men, heads of fathers’ houses, &c.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all of them by their names</span>] A full list of the households being furnished, the representative chiefs of certain ‘houses’ were required by name to attend. Cf. ‘were expressed by name’, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-20.htm" title="Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.">Ezra 8:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">were separated</span>] i.e. were set apart for the work. The use of this word ‘separated’ shows that a certain number and not all of the chiefs were employed on this occasion. The text is not quite free from suspicion. The absence of the copula before ‘men (or, certain) heads’ taken in conjunction with the reading of the Syriac Peshitto favours another rendering ‘And Ezra the priest separated (or set apart for the work) certain men (that were) heads &c.’ In other words Ezra made the necessary selection. Not all the heads of the great houses were summoned to sit on the commission. We read of ninety-eight in, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/2-3.htm" title="The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two....">Ezra 2:3-61</a>, and this number would have been far too unwieldy for the purpose. Certain of them were therefore to be set apart from the whole number. And Ezra was the natural person to make the selection. Having recently arrived from Babylon, he would be impartial, while the fact of his having originated the whole movement marked him out to be head of the enquiry.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">, and sat down</span>] R.V.; <span class="bld">and they sat down.</span> The R.V. separates the clause more-definitely from the preceding one. The Hebrew phrase is the same as the English ‘and the commission held its first sitting’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the first day of the tenth month</span>] The first of Tebeth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-16.htm" title="So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.">Esther 2:16</a>), the Assyrian Tibi-tuv, about the same as our January.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to examine the matter</span>] The Hebrew word ‘to examine’ is of very strange form, and looks as if the name of ‘Darius’ had been carelessly introduced by a copyist in the place of the similar word ‘to examine’. He was perhaps reminded, by the look of the letters, of the word similarly formed composing the familiar name of the king.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">children of the captivity</span> did so. The people generally, notwithstanding the opposition of Jonathan, acquiesced in Ezra's decision, and acted accordingly. <span class="cmt_word">Ezra the priest, with certain chief of the fathers.</span> There is no "with," or other connective, in the original; but our translators did right in supplying one, since the conjunction <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span>, "and," has almost certainly fallen out of the text by the mistake of a copyist. <span class="cmt_word">After</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house of their fathers.</span> Rather, "for each father's house"  -  <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "for each family."
