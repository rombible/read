For these elders and judges of the several cities were best able to inform the great council at Jerusalem, concerning the quality of the persons accused, and all matters of fact, and circumstances. And this proceeding, they proposed, should continue as long as there remained any thing to be done in this business, that the wrath of God might be turned away from them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:6-14 There is hope concerning people, when they are convinced, not only that it is good to part with their sins, but that it is necessary; we must do it, or we are undone. So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous the redemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear the gospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mourn for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we must ourselves be affected.

But as the weather was ungenial and the defaulters were too numerous to be passed in review at one time, it was resolved that a commission should be appointed to examine into the whole matter. These commissioners, assisted by the judges and elders of the respective cities, made a minute investigation into every case, and after three months' labor completely removed all traces of the abuse.

A commission recommended.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Let now our princes be appointed</span> (marg. Heb. <span class="ital">stand</span>) <span class="bld">for all the congregation.</span> The A.V. fails to give the idea of the original, where a difficulty is occasioned by the preposition ‘for’. There are practically two ways of explaining the passage (1) Let now our princes stand for (i.e. in the place of <span class="greekheb">ἀντὶ</span>) all the congregation. (2) Let there now stand our princes for (i.e. in the interests of, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ</span>) all the congregation. The latter is the preferable. The commission then was to consist of the princes who, in conjunction with the local elders and judges, should enquire into the cases that had occurred in each town and district.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">and let all them that are in our cities which have married strange women.</span> The R.V. reproduces the two relative sentences of the original, the one giving the locality of the offender, the other particularizing the offence; perhaps the formal character of the actual wording of the decree here peeps out.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in our cities</span>] This expression seems to exclude Jerusalem. The case of those who dwelt in the capital could be investigated by the princes on the spot and without delay. In the case of inhabitants of other towns, the officials of each town were to be convened at Jerusalem and to assist the permanent commission; the offenders at the same time were to be summoned to attend the investigation in person.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">at appointed times</span>] Cf. ‘at times appointed’, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-34.htm" title="And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law:">Nehemiah 10:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-31.htm" title="And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.">Nehemiah 13:31</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the elders of every city, and the judges thereof</span>] i.e. the representatives of the populace and the administrators of justice, belonging to each town.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">until the fierce wrath of our God … be turned from us</span>] So also R.V. It is much to be doubted whether this can be regarded as a satisfactory rendering.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) There is no real connexion between the previous sentence ‘let our princes be appointed &c.’ and the words ‘until the fierce wrath, &c.’ ‘The fierce wrath’ had not been displayed, as in David’s day, by a visitation such as a plague or a famine, nor by any fresh hostile oppression. There is therefore no natural explanation for the expression, such as there is for the very similar words ‘Hide thyself for a little moment, <span class="ital">until</span> the indignation be overpast’, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm" title="Come, my people, enter you into your chambers, and shut your doors about you: hide yourself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be over.">Isaiah 26:20</a>; ‘Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge, <span class="ital">until</span> these calamities be overpast’, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/57-1.htm" title="Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me: for my soul trusts in you: yes, in the shadow of your wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be over.">Psalm 57:1</a>. If there was no external symptom of the Divine displeasure, its continuance could only be apprehended mentally or morally, and would have no sort of relation to the investigation and punishment of the offence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) The work of the commission—in a great measure an undertaking of popular contrition, but very largely also the expression of a definite policy of excluding aliens from the community—could not be concluded, <span class="ital">until</span> its ends had been accomplished. Now unless we are prepared to change the words ‘until the fierce wrath, &c.’ into so different a meaning as ‘until the cause of the fierce wrath &c. be removed’, it seems that a limitation of time has no rightful place here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) The English rendering ignores the literal transitive meaning of the verb. Literally translated, the sentence runs, ‘up to the point of, to turn away the fierce wrath of our God’. It seems very probable that we should reject the temporal signification of the word rendered ‘until’, and treat it as an instance of a redundancy not uncommon in late Hebrew. It will then merely strengthen the preposition, denoting purpose, prefixed to the verb. Supposing this to be the true explanation, the rendering will be ‘with a view (or, unto this end) to turn away the fierce wrath of our God’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verb, which is transitive, is thus given its proper force familiar in other similar passages. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-38.htm" title="But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yes, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.">Psalm 78:38</a> ‘Yea, many a time <span class="ital">turned he his anger away</span>’; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-23.htm" title="Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.">Psalm 106:23</a> ‘Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach <span class="ital">to turn away his wrath</span>’; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-20.htm" title="Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have dig a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before you to speak good for them, and to turn away your wrath from them.">Jeremiah 18:20</a> ‘Remember how I stood before thee to speak good for them, <span class="ital">to turn away thy fury from them</span>’; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-1.htm" title="A soft answer turns away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.">Proverbs 15:1</a> ‘A soft answer <span class="ital">turneth away</span> wrath’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The English version gives the general sense in the same way as the Vulgate ‘donec revertatur ira Dei nostri a vobis’. But the English reader would never guess that the verb is used, not in the intransitive form ‘to return’ (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.">Numbers 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-10.htm" title="Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.">2 Chronicles 29:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-8.htm" title="Now be you not stiff necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.">2 Chronicles 30:8</a> : <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-24.htm" title="The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he has done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall consider it.">Jeremiah 30:24</a>), but in the causative ‘to cause to return’, ‘to turn away’ ‘to avert’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the fierce wrath of our God</span>] This particular expression ‘the fierce wrath’, as applied to the Almighty, occurs in the O.T. thirty-four times, being used with special frequency (ten times) in Jeremiah. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-11.htm" title="Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which you have taken captive of your brothers: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is on you.">2 Chronicles 28:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-13.htm" title="And said to them, You shall not bring in the captives here: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, you intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.">2 Chronicles 28:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-10.htm" title="Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.">2 Chronicles 29:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-8.htm" title="Now be you not stiff necked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves to the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he has sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.">2 Chronicles 30:8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for this matter</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">until this matter be dispatched.</span> Marg. Or, <span class="ital">as touching this matter</span>. Literally rendered, the Hebrew words give ‘up to the point of (or, until), to this matter’. The R.V. apparently coordinates this clause with the preceding one. But there can be but one opinion that the whole sentence ‘Let now our princes be appointed … until the fierce wrath of our God be turned from us, until this matter be dispatched’, is quite intolerably harsh. The last clause only receives definiteness from the insertion of the words ‘be dispatched’. But it constitutes a most empty addition to state that the enquiry should last until its business was dispatched. The present phrase is apparently only another instance, if the text be correct, of the same redundancy of expression in the later Hebrew mentioned above. The word, rendered ‘until’, amplifies the preposition. And the usage of the compound preposition is the same as that of the simple preposition when found with the same words elsewhere. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-21.htm" title="And he said to him, See, I have accepted you concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which you have spoken.">Genesis 19:21</a> ‘concerning this thing’; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-24.htm" title="For who will listen to you in this matter? but as his part is that goes down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarries by the stuff: they shall part alike.">1 Samuel 30:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-14.htm" title="So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.">Daniel 1:14</a> ‘in this matter’. The rendering of the margin is therefore to be preferred, ‘to turn away the fierce wrath of our God <span class="ital">as touching this matter</span>’. The words are the same in meaning as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-15.htm" title="O LORD God of Israel, you are righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before you in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before you because of this.">Ezra 9:15</a> ‘because of this’, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-2.htm" title="And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.">Ezra 10:2</a> ‘concerning this thing’.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let now our rulers of the congregation stand</span>.

This is probably the true meaning of the writer, but it is not to be obtained from the ordinary text. To produce it we must read by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> and <span class="accented">haddabar</span> for <span class="accented">laddabar hazzeh.</span> As the text stands, it is unintelligible. OPPOSITION OF JONATHAN AND OTHERS (ver. 15). It was natural that some opposition should manifest itself when so trenchant a measure was announced as that which Ezra had declared to be necessary. To compel men to divorce their wives was to touch many in the tenderest place. Nor was it difficult to bring forward very plausible arguments to show that the marriages - or at any rate some of them - were allowable. Joseph had married an Egyptian (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>), Moses a Midianite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>). True, these marriages had taken place before the law was given; but subsequently, also, Boaz had married Ruth the Moabitess (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13</a>); David had taken to wife Maacah, a Geshurite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>); and Solomon had without blame married the daughter of a Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>). These examples might be pleaded in proof that the Law admitted of exceptions, and individuals might argue that their cases were of an exceptional character. Again, in some instances the foreign wives may have become proselytes, and the children may have been circumcised, and so accepted into the congregation; which would give them a claim to remain, which would extend in some degree to the mothers. We therefore cannot be surprised that an opposition was made. Rather, it is remarkable that it was so slight, only extending (so far as appears) to four persons, and so easily quelled. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The resolution carried into execution. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-7.htm">Ezra 10:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-8.htm">Ezra 10:8</a>.
