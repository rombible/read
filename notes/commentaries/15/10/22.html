And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They gave their hands - i. e., "solemnly pledged themselves" (compare the marginal references).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. they gave their hands&#8212;that is, came under a solemn engagement, which was usually ratified by pledging the right hand (Pr 6:1; Eze 17:18). The delinquents of the priestly order bound themselves to do like the common Israelites (Ezr 10:25), and sought to expiate their sin by sacrificing a ram as a trespass offering.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives,.... They proposed to do it, and actually did it: <p>and being guilty; of which they were fully convinced: <p>they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass; to make atonement for it, and thereby set an example to others to do the like. Aben Ezra observes, that we do not find that the trespass offering was a mulct to such who married strange wives, and conjectures, that it was the advice of the chief men to do it. From hence, to the end of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-43.htm">Ezra 10:43</a>, is a list of the men that had married strange wives, and put them away; those in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-20.htm">Ezra 10:20</a>, were priests; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-23.htm">Ezra 10:23</a>, Levites, and those of them who were singers or porters; the rest were Israelites: and it is a very common distinction, in rabbinical writers, to distinguish the Jews into priests, Levites, and Israelites; of these we know no more than their names; some of the heads of the families may be observed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezra/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Jonathan the son of Asahel, and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah, indeed opposed this proposal on the part of the community, and were supported in their opposition by two Levites, but without being able to carry it out. This statement is introduced by &#1488;&#1498;, only, in the form of a qualification to the remark that the whole assembly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-12.htm">Ezra 10:12</a>) made this resolution: nevertheless Jonathan ... stood up against this. For &#1506;&#1500; &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, to stand up against, or as elsewhere &#1506;&#1500; &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-14.htm">Daniel 11:14</a>. Such also is the view of R. Sal. and Lightf., while older expositors understand it as meaning: only Jonathan ... stood up for this matter, like the steterunt super hoc of the Vulgate, or as the decidedly incorrect explanation of J. H. Mich.: praefecti sunt huic negotio. - Nothing further is known of the four opponents here named. That they did not succeed in this opposition appears from what follows. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-16.htm">Ezra 10:16</a> The children of the captivity, i.e., the returned exiles, did so; i.e., the congregation carried their resolve into execution. And Ezra the priest, and men, heads of houses according to their houses, - i.e., so that each house was represented by its head, - were separated, i.e., chosen to conduct the investigation. The &#1493; copulative before &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; has been lost, as asyndeton seeming in this case inadmissible. Bertheau, on the contrary, unnecessarily changes &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; into &#1500;&#1493; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;&#1500; after 1 Esdras 9:16.

It is impossible in Hebrew to form &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473; from &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, and this word can only arise from &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, as Ewald, 239, a, note, Olshausen, Lehrb. d. hebr. Spr. p. 150, and Bttcher, ausf. Lehrb. der hebr. Spr. i. 1, p. 162, note, unanimously agree. </body></html>
