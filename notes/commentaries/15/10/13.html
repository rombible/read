So rich is the mercy, and so plenteous the redemption of God, that there is hope for the vilest who hear the gospel, and are willing to accept of free salvation. When sinners mourn for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we must ourselves be affected. It was carefully agreed how this affair should be carried on. That which is hastily resolved on seldom proves lasting.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was the ninth month - Or, our December, a time when rain fails heavily in Palestine: four months, therefore, after Ezra's arrival in Jerusalem (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>).<p>The street - Rather, "the court," the "broad," "spacious, place" (compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-17. Ezra the priest stood up, and said&#8212;Having fully represented the enormity of their sin and urged them to dissolve their unlawful connections, he was gratified by receiving a prompt acknowledgment of the justice of his reproof and a promise of compliance with his recommendation. But as the weather was ungenial and the defaulters were too numerous to be passed in review at one time, it was resolved that a commission should be appointed to examine into the whole matter. These commissioners, assisted by the judges and elders of the respective cities, made a minute investigation into every case, and after three months' labor completely removed all traces of the abuse. Doubtless, an adequate provision was made for the repudiated wives and children, according to the means and circumstances of the husbands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But the people are many,....

Such an enquiry must be of a lengthy nature. The matter cannot be summarily disposed of. The people who have come in from a distance cannot in the rainy weather protract their stay in the city by living and sleeping in the open air, as they would have done had it been summer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for we are many that have transgressed in this thing</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.</span> The A.V. is not the correct rendering, but it expresses the general meaning. The greatness of the transgression consisted in the number of the offenders as well as in the heinousness of the offence. ‘Transgress’, see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-10.htm" title="And Ezra the priest stood up, and said to them, You have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.">Ezra 10:10</a>. The verb (pâshâ) frequently means to rebel (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-1.htm" title="Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.">2 Kings 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-5.htm" title="But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.">2 Kings 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-7.htm" title="And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses.">2 Kings 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm" title="In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves.">2 Kings 8:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-22.htm" title="Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day.
