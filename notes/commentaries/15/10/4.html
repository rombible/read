The case is sad, but it is not desperate; the disease threatening, but not incurable. Now that the people begin to lament, a spirit of repentance seems to be poured out; now there is hope that God will forgive, and have mercy. The sin that rightly troubles us, shall not ruin us. In melancholy times we must observe what makes for us, as well as against us. And there may be good hopes through grace, even where there is the sense of great guilt before God. The case is plain; what has been done amiss, must be undone again as far as possible; nothing less than this is true repentance. Sin must be put away, with a resolution never to have any thing more to do with it. What has been unjustly got, must be restored. Arise, be of good courage. Weeping, in this case, is good, but reforming is better. As to being unequally yoked with unbelievers, such marriages, it is certain, are sinful, and ought not to be made; but now they are not null, as they were before the gospel did away the separation between Jews and Gentiles.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let it be done according to the law - i. e., let a formal "bill of divorcement" be given to each foreign wife, whereby she will be restored to the condition of an unmarried woman, and be free to marry another husband (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-2</a>). The facility of divorce among the Jews is well-known. According to many of the rabbis, a bill of divorcement might he given by the husband for the most trivial cause. Thus, no legal difficulty stood in the way of Shechaniah's proposition; and Ezra regarded it as necessary for the moral and religious welfare of the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-4. Shechaniah &#8230; answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed&#8212;This was one of the leading men, who was not himself a delinquent in the matter, for his name does not occur in the following list. He spoke in the general name of the people, and his conduct evinced a tender conscience, as well as no small fortitude in making such a proposal; for as his father and five paternal uncles (Ezr 10:26) were involved in the guilt of unlawful marriages, he showed, by the measure he recommended, that he deemed it better to obey God than to please his nearest relatives.<p>yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing&#8212;This hope, however, depended on timely measures of reformation, and therefore, instead of surrendering themselves to despair or despondency, he counselled them to amend their error without delay, relying on God's mercy for the past. Though the proposal may seem harsh and cruel, yet in the peculiar circumstances of the Jews it was just as well as necessary; and he urged the duty of seeing it executed on Ezra, as the only person competent to carry it into effect, being possessed of skill and address for so delicate and difficult a work, and invested by God, and under Him by the Persian king (Ezr 7:23-28), with the requisite authority to enforce it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">This matter belongeth unto thee; </span> because thou hast both skill to manage it, and authority both from God and from the Persian king to do it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Arise,....

Literally ‘for this matter is upon thee’. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-13.htm" title="And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute to their brothers.">Nehemiah 13:13</a>, ‘And their business was (lit. and it was upon them) to distribute unto their brethren’. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>, ‘And the government shall be upon his shoulder’. Ezra was marked out for the duty, partly because he had so publicly testified to his condemnation of the people’s sin, partly because he had received the royal commission ‘to teach’ them that knew not the laws of his God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-25.htm" title="And you, Ezra, after the wisdom of your God, that is in your hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of your God; and teach you them that know them not.">Ezra 7:25</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we also</span> will be <span class="ital">with thee</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">and we are with thee.</span> The R.V. gives the full meaning, by placing only a comma after ‘thee’. The lead in the work was Ezra’s, but Shechaniah and his friends were ready to cooperate at once in the reform. The present tense is therefore more appropriate than the future.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be of good courage, and do</span> it] Literally, ‘be strong, and do’. The responsibility of initiative required especial courage, when the policy would inevitably produce widespread discontent with no material compensation. David uses the same words to Solomon when entrusting to him the work of constructing the Temple. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-10.htm" title="Take heed now; for the LORD has chosen you to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.">1 Chronicles 28:10</a>, ‘Take heed now; for the Lord hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it’: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-11.htm" title="And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good.">2 Chronicles 19:11</a>, ‘Deal courageously’ (Heb.

Wilt Thou not be angry with us even to extirpation, so that no residue and no escaped remnant should be left?" The premiss in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a> is followed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm">Ezra 9:14</a> by the conclusion in the form of a question, while the second clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a> is an explanatory parenthesis. Bertheau construes the passage otherwise. He finds the continuation of the sentence: and after all this ... in the words &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, which, calmly spoken, would read: Thou, O God, hast not wholly destroyed us, but hast preserved to us an escaped remnant; while instead of such a continuation we have an exclamation of grateful wonder, emphatically introduced by &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in the sense of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1501;. With this construction of the clauses, however, no advance is made, and Ezra, in this prayer, does but repeat what he had already said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-9.htm">Ezra 9:9</a>; although the introductory &#1488;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497; leads us to expect a new thought to close the confession. Then, too, the logical connection between the question <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm">Ezra 9:14</a> and what precedes it would be wanting, i.e., a foundation of fact for the question <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm">Ezra 9:14</a>. Bertheau remarks on <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm">Ezra 9:14</a>, that the question: should we return to break (i.e., break again) the commands of God? is an antithesis to the exclamation. But neither does this question, to judge by its matter, stand in contrast to the exclamation, nor is any such contrast indicated by its form. The discourse advances in regular progression only when <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-14.htm">Ezra 9:14</a> forms the conclusion arrived at from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>, and the thought in the premiss (13a) is limited by the thoughts introduced with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. What had come upon Israel for their sins was, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-7.htm">Ezra 9:7</a>, deliverance into the hand of heathen kings, to the sword, to captivity, etc. God had not, however, merely chastened and punished His people for their sins, He had also extended mercy to them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>, etc. This, therefore, is also mentioned by Ezra in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>, to justify, or rather to limit, the &#1499;&#1468;&#1500; in &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1488;. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is properly confirmatory: for Thou, our God, hast indeed punished us, but not in such measure as our sins had deserved; and receives through the tenor of the clause the adversative meaning of imo, yea (comp. Ewald, 330, b). &#1500;&#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492; &#1502; &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;, Thou hast checked, hast stopped, beneath our iniquities. &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498; is not used intransitively, but actively; the missing object must be supplied from the context: Thou hast withheld that, all of which should have come upon us, i.e., the punishment we deserved, or, as older expositors completed the sense, iram tuam. &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, infra delicta nostra, i.e., Thou hast punished us less than our iniquities deserved. For their iniquities they had merited extirpation; but God had given them a rescued remnant. &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, as this, viz., this which exists in the community now returned from Babylon to Judaea. This is the circumstance which justifies the question: should we, or can we, again (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; is used adverbially) break Thy commandments, and become related by marriage? (&#1495;&#1514;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503;   like <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>.) &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;, people who live in abominations. The answer to this question is found in the subsequent question: will He not - if, after the sparing mercy we have experienced, we again transgress the commands of God - by angry with us till He have consumed us? &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1491; (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-17.htm">2 Kings 13:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-19.htm">2 Kings 13:19</a>) is strengthened by the addition: so that there will be no remnant and no escaping. The question introduced by &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; is an expression of certain assurance: He will most certainly consume us.</body></html>
