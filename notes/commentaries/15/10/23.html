And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They gave their hands - i. e., "solemnly pledged themselves" (compare the marginal references).<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. they gave their hands&#8212;that is, came under a solemn engagement, which was usually ratified by pledging the right hand (Pr 6:1; Eze 17:18). The delinquents of the priestly order bound themselves to do like the common Israelites (Ezr 10:25), and sought to expiate their sin by sacrificing a ram as a trespass offering.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives,.... They proposed to do it, and actually did it: <p>and being guilty; of which they were fully convinced: <p>they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass; to make atonement for it, and thereby set an example to others to do the like. Aben Ezra observes, that we do not find that the trespass offering was a mulct to such who married strange wives, and conjectures, that it was the advice of the chief men to do it. From hence, to the end of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-43.htm">Ezra 10:43</a>, is a list of the men that had married strange wives, and put them away; those in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-20.htm">Ezra 10:20</a>, were priests; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-23.htm">Ezra 10:23</a>, Levites, and those of them who were singers or porters; the rest were Israelites: and it is a very common distinction, in rabbinical writers, to distinguish the Jews into priests, Levites, and Israelites; of these we know no more than their names; some of the heads of the families may be observed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezra/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezra/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23â€“25</span>.

Still less can &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, as Bertheau thinks, be taken in the sense of "in every place," and &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; connected as an accusative with &#1493;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;: they finished in every place the men (!); for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; with an accusative of the person signifies to annihilate, to make an end of, while &#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; means to finish, to make an end with, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-12.htm">Genesis 44:12</a>.

As this gives a suitable meaning, it seems unnecessary to alter the punctuation and read &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, or with Ewald, 290, c, note 1, to regard &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; as a singular combination. - Till the first day of the first month (of the next year), therefore in three months, their sittings having begun, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-13.htm">Ezra 10:13</a>, on the first day of the tenth month. - The account of this transaction closes with - <p>The list of the men who had taken strange wives, vv. 18-44; among whom were priests (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18-22</a>), Levites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-23.htm">Ezra 10:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-24.htm">Ezra 10:24</a>), and Israelites, i.e., laymen (vv. 25-43). </body></html>
