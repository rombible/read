When sinners mourn for their sins, and tremble at the word of God, there is hope that they will forsake them. To affect others with godly sorrow or love to God, we must ourselves be affected.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-23.htm" title="The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.">Nehemiah 12:23</a> we find the mention of a ‘Johanan the son of Eliashib’, but who, by comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-7.htm" title="And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;">Ezra 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-22.htm" title="And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.">Ezra 10:22</a>, must have been this Eliashib’s grandson. It is probable that the ‘Jehohanan the son of Eliashib’ is the same as that ‘Johanan the son of Eliashib’. If so, how are we to account for a chamber, presumably in the Temple precincts, being assigned to one who was the grandson of the High-priest Eliashib? (<span class="ital">a</span>) Some suppose that Johanan the grandson of Eliashib was old enough at this time to receive as one of the High-priestly family a special chamber. But why should Ezra betake himself to the chamber of one who must have been but a mere boy? For Eliashib was living 20 years later (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-7.htm" title="And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.">Nehemiah 13:7</a>). (<span class="ital">b</span>) Others suppose the Compiler to be using the language of a considerably later generation than that of Ezra; he knew of a certain chamber in the Temple’s precincts as Johanan’s chamber, because it had become associated with the name of Eliashib’s grandson during his High-priesthood. This appears to be the most probable explanation. If so, the use of the name helps to determine the date at which Ezra’s Memoirs were compiled. It is however possible that the Jehohanan the son of Eliashib was of a different family from the Johanan the son of Joiada and grandson of Eliashib, and that the difficulty is only an apparent one arising from the similarity of names in the families of the same great house or tribe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and</span> when <span class="ital">he came thither, he did eat</span>, &c.] So the R.V. text. The R.V. marg. says ‘According to some ancient versions, <span class="ital">and he lodged there</span>’. The Hebrew word for ‘he came’ is the same as that for ‘went’ in the previous clause. This reading is supported by the Hebrew text and by the LXX. (<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπορεύθη ἐκεῖ</span>). It is however hard to believe that it can be the original reading. (1) The repetition of the word is awkward. (2) The clause, stating that he refused to taste food, does not follow suitably upon the mention of his arrival. (3) The adverb in the original does not strictly mean ‘thither’, but ‘there’. The parallel passage in 1 Esdras (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm" title="For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands: yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass.">Ezra 9:2</a>) has ‘and having lodged there’, and this reading is supported by the Syriac Peshitto and the Arabic. The variation in the Hebrew text requisite to give this meaning is exceedingly small. In the old Hebrew characters the two letters (<span class="greekheb">ן</span> and <span class="greekheb">ך</span>) are very liable to be confused, while the use of the very similar verb just before made an accidental repetition very possible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This reading is probably correct, and we should accordingly translate ‘And he lodged (or passed the night) there’. The words are then the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-11.htm" title="And he lighted on a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.">Genesis 28:11</a>, ‘And he tarried there all night’; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-13.htm" title="And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;">Genesis 32:13</a>, ‘And he lodged there that night’; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-9.htm" title="Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.">Joshua 8:9</a>, ‘but Joshua lodged that night’. The point emphasized is that Ezra continued in the precincts of the Temple all that night and protracted his fast. ‘He lodged there and did eat no bread nor drink water’: i.e. while he lodged there, he fasted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because of the transgression of them that had been carried away</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">because of the trespass</span> of them <span class="bld">of the captivity.</span> ‘Trespass’, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-4.htm" title="Then were assembled to me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.">Ezra 9:4</a>. ‘Them of the captivity’, i.e. ‘haggolah’, cf. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm" title="Also the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt offering to the LORD.">Ezra 8:35</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">chamber of Johanan.</span> On the temple chambers see comment on Ezra 8:29. Johanan appears by <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22, 23</a>, compared with vers. 10-11, to have been really the grandson of Eliashib, who, as high priest, would have the right of assigning him a chamber in the temple (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I did eat no bread nor drink water</span>. Strict fasts of this kind had been observed by Moses twice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>), and by the Ninevites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-7.htm">Jonah 3:7</a>), but they were very uncommon. Usually it was considered enough to abstain from eating (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-7.htm">1 Samuel 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-34.htm">1 Samuel 20:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>). Sometimes the person who fasted merely abstained from "meat and wine, and <span class="accented">pleasant</span> bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>). Ezra's great earnestness appears in the severity of his fast, which (it is to be remembered) was not for his own sins, but for those of his brethren. PROCLAMATION MADE, SUMMONING ALL THE JEWS TO JERUSALEM (vers. 7- 9). After due deliberation between Ezra, the princes, and the elders (ver. 8), it was resolved, as a first step, to summon all Jews  - or, rather, all those who had returned from the captivity, whether they were Jews or Israelites - to Jerusalem, in order that the decision come to with respect to the mixed marriages might be communicated to them. The limit of three days was fixed as the latest date at which any one might make his appearance, and absentees were threatened with the heavy penalties of excommunication and forfeiture of all their possessions. Proclamation having been made to this effect "throughout Judah" (ver. 7), there was a gathering of all the males of full age to Jerusalem within the prescribed time. The place of meeting was the great court of the temple (ver. 9). According to Hecataeus of Abdera (Fr. 14), this was "a stone-walled enclosure, about 500 feet long and 150 feet wide," which might perhaps afford sitting room for 20,000 men. Deducting the aged and infirm, the sick, and those between twelve and twenty years of age, the country Jews would scarcely have reached this number. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Jahve, God of Israel, Thou art righteous; for we remain an escaped remnant, as (it is) this day. Behold, we are before Thee in our trespass; for no one can stand before Thy face, because of this." Ezra appeals to the righteousness of God, not to supplicate pardon, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-33.htm">Nehemiah 9:33</a>, for the righteousness of God would impel Him to extirpate the sinful nation, but to rouse the conscience of the community, to point out to them what, after this relapse into their old abominations, they had to expect from the justice of God. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is confirmatory. God has shown Himself to be just by so sorely punishing this once numerous nation, that only a small remnant which has escaped destruction now exists. And this remnant has again most grievously offended: we lie before Thee in our trespass; what can we expect from Thy justice? Nothing but destruction; for there is no standing before Thee, i.e., no one can stand before Thee, &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514;, because of this (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-23.htm">Ezra 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-2.htm">Ezra 10:2</a>), i.e., because of the fresh guilt which we have incurred. </body></html>
