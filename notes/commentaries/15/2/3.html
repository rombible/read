In the following instances we note when two of the three authorities agree. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-6.htm" title="The children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred and twelve.">Ezra 2:6</a>, Ezra is confirmed by 1 Esdras as against Nehemiah’s 2,818; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-8.htm" title="The children of Zattu, nine hundred forty and five.">Ezra 2:8</a>, against his 945; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-11.htm" title="The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and three.">Ezra 2:11</a>, against his 628; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-15.htm" title="The children of Adin, four hundred fifty and four.">Ezra 2:15</a>, against his 655; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-17.htm" title="The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and three.">Ezra 2:17</a>, against his 324; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-33.htm" title="The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and five.">Ezra 2:33</a>, against his 721. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-10.htm" title="The children of Bani, six hundred forty and two.">Ezra 2:10</a>, the children of Bani, or Binnui, are 642, but 1 Esdras agrees with Nehemiah in making them 648; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-14.htm" title="The children of Bigvai, two thousand fifty and six.">Ezra 2:14</a>, the two latter correct <span class= "ital">666</span> into 667.—In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-20.htm" title="The children of Gibbar, ninety and five.">Ezra 2:20</a>, heads of families become places; Nehemiah substitutes Gibeon for Gibbar. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-30.htm" title="The children of Magbish, an hundred fifty and six.">Ezra 2:30</a> has no representative in Nehemiah. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-31.htm" title="The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.">Ezra 2:31</a>, “the other Elam” has the same number as Elam in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-7.htm" title="The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.">Ezra 2:7</a>; and the Nebo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-29.htm" title="The children of Nebo, fifty and two.">Ezra 2:29</a> is called in Nehemiah “the other Nebo,” though the only one, as if the “other” had slipped in from what in Nehemiah is found in the next verse.

All seem to have been taken from the same original document, and to have suffered more or less from corruption.

A special branch of this family, called after Shechaniah, returned with Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-3.htm" title="Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty.">Ezra 8:3</a>). Members of the family are mentioned as having married ‘strange wives’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-25.htm" title="Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah.">Ezra 10:25</a>) and as assisting in the rebuilding of the walls (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-25.htm" title="Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and the tower which lies out from the king's high house, that was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh.">Nehemiah 3:25</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">3–19</span>. Names of households or families. Many of these names occur again in other lists, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/8-1.htm" title="These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king....">Ezra 8:1-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/10-18.htm" title="And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah....">Ezra 10:18-44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/10-1.htm" title="Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,...">Nehemiah 10:1-27</a>, and in connexion with much later events in the lifetime of Ezra and Nehemiah. These names therefore are not to be regarded as the names of the leading men of the various families who accompanied Zerubbabel, but as the <span class="ital">titles</span> of the families or clans into which the people were divided. These titles were probably taken from the founders of the families and were many of them of great antiquity. The mention of the same names of the ‘families’ at the return of Ezra (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/8-1.htm" title="These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king....">Ezra 8:1-14</a>) merely shows that, though a certain number of a household had accompanied Zerubbabel, many members of it remained in Babylon, of whom some returned with Ezra, e.g. Parosh, Pahath-moab, Adin, Shephatiah, Elam, Bebai, Azgad, Adonikam, Bigvai, &c., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-14.htm" title="The chief of the people; Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu, Bani,">Nehemiah 10:14</a> ff.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Cyrus delivered these vessels &#1497;&#1491; &#1506;&#1500;, into the hand of the treasurer, to whose care they were entrusted; i.e., placed them under his inspection, that they might be faithfully restored. &#1502;&#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1514; is Mithridates. &#1504;&#1468;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, answering to the Zend gazabara, means treasurer (see comm. on Dan. p. 514, note 4). This officer counted them out to the prince of Judah Sheshbazzar, undoubtedly the Chaldee name of Zerubbabel. For, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-14.htm">Ezra 5:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-16.htm">Ezra 5:16</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512; was the governor (&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492;) placed by Cyrus over the new community in Judah and Jerusalem, and who, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-11.htm">Ezra 1:11</a> of the present chapter, returned to Jerusalem at the head of those who departed from Babylon; while we are informed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/3-1.htm">Ezra 3:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-3.htm">Ezra 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-2.htm">Ezra 5:2</a>) that Zerubbabel was not only at the head of the returning Jews, but also presided as secular ruler over the settlement of the community in Judah and Jerusalem. The identity of Sheshbazzar with Zerubbabel, which has been objected to by Schrader and Nldeke, is placed beyond a doubt by a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-16.htm">Ezra 5:16</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>, etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-2.htm">Ezra 5:2</a> : for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-16.htm">Ezra 5:16</a> Sheshbazzar is named as he who laid the foundation of the new temple in Jerusalem; and this, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-2.htm">Ezra 5:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>, was done by Zerubbabel. The view, too, that Zerubbabel, besides this his Hebrew name, had, as the official of the Persian king, also a Chaldee name, is in complete analogy with the case of Daniel and his three companions, who, on being taken into the service of the Babylonian king, received Chaldee names (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a>). Zerubbabel, moreover, seems, even before his appointment of &#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; to the Jewish community in Judah, to have held some office in either the Babylonian or Persian Court or State; for Cyrus would hardly have entrusted this office to any private individual among the Jews. The meaning of the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1512; is not yet ascertained: in the lxx it is written &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;, &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;, and &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;; 1 Esdras has &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;, or, according to better MSS, &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;; and Josephus, l.c., &#x391;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;.</body></html>
