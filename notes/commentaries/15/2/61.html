Barzillai’s son Chimham accompanied David to Jerusalem on his return (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,">2 Samuel 17:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-32.htm" title="Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.">2 Samuel 19:32</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-7.htm" title="But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at your table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom your brother.">1 Kings 2:7</a>). Chimham probably founded a family called after his own name, which resided at Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-17.htm" title="And they departed, and dwelled in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,">Jeremiah 41:17</a>). Barzillai’s position and estates in Gilead were inherited by his daughters, through whom their father’s name was preserved. One of them was married to a priest, who thereupon received the family name. His descendants however were unable to make out their claim to belong to the priesthood; possibly on account of the confusion resulting from the altered name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The R.V. places a full stop at the close of this verse.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 61.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the children of the priests.</span> Some of those who claimed to be descendants of Aaron, and therefore priests, had also lost the evidence of their descent.

The sum-total of these amounting only to 392, each family could only have averaged from eight to nine individuals. The sons of Akkub, Hagab and Asnah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-45.htm">Ezra 2:45</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-46.htm">Ezra 2:46</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-50.htm">Ezra 2:50</a>), are omitted in Nehemiah; the name Shalmai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-46.htm">Ezra 2:46</a>) is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-48.htm">Nehemiah 7:48</a> written Salmai; and for &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-50.htm">Ezra 2:50</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-52.htm">Nehemiah 7:52</a> has &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, a form combined from &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;. All other variations relate only to differences of form. Because Ziha (&#1510;&#1497;&#1492;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-43.htm">Ezra 2:43</a>) again occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-21.htm">Nehemiah 11:21</a> as one of the chiefs of the Nethinim, and the names following seem to stand in the same series with it, Bertheau insists on regarding these names as those of divisions. This cannot, however, be correct; for Ziha is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-21.htm">Nehemiah 11:21</a> the name of an individual, and in the present list also the proper names are those of individuals, and only the sons of Ziha, Hasupha, etc., can be called families or divisions. Plural words alone, Mehunim and Nephisim, are names of races or nations; hence the sons of the Mehunim signify individuals belonging to the Mehunim, who, perhaps, after the victory of King Uzziah over that people, were as prisoners of war made vassals for the service of the sanctuary. So likewise may the sons of the Nephisim have been prisoners of war of the Ishmaelite race &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;. Most of the families here named may, however, have been descendants of the Gibeonites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>). The servants of Solomon must not be identified with the Canaanite bond-servants mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">2 Chronicles 8:7</a>., but were probably prisoners of war of some other nation, whom Solomon sentenced to perform, as bondsmen, similar services to those imposed upon the Gibeonites. The sons of these servants are again mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3</a>. In other passages they are comprised under the general term Nethinim, with whom they are here computed. Among the names, that of &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-57.htm">Ezra 2:57</a>), i.e., catcher of gazelles, is a singular one; the last name, &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;, is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-59.htm">Nehemiah 7:59</a> &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. </body></html>
