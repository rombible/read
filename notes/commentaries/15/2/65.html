Ezra's items make the number 29,818; Nehemiah's 31,089, Esdras, 33,950. The original document was probably illegible in places, and the writers were forced to make omissions. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>64. The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore&#8212;This gross amount is twelve thousand more than the particular numbers given in the catalogue, when added together, come to. Reckoning up the smaller numbers, we shall find that they amount to 29,818 in this chapter, and to 31,089 in the parallel chapter of Nehemiah [see Ne 7:66-69]. Ezra also mentions four hundred ninety-four persons omitted by Nehemiah, and Nehemiah mentions 1765 not noticed by Ezra. If, therefore, Ezra's surplus be added to the sum in Nehemiah, and Nehemiah's surplus to the number in Ezra, they will both become 31,583. Subtracting this from 42,360, there will be a deficiency of 10,777. These are omitted because they did not belong to Judah and Benjamin, or to the priests, but to the other tribes. The servants and singers, male and female, are reckoned separately (Ezr 2:65), so that putting all these items together, the number of all who went with Zerubbabel amounted to fifty thousand, with eight thousand beasts of burden [Alting, quoted in Davidson's Hermeneutics].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> For women as well as men were devoted to and employed in this exercise in the temple service, as appears from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/25-5.htm" title="All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn.

The meaning is not that singing men and women were included among the servants, but that ‘the whole congregation’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-64.htm" title="The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and three score,">Ezra 2:64</a>) had in attendance, besides their servants, their troop of singers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">singing</span> men <span class="ital">and singing</span> women] The mention of these has caused some difficulty. (1) Singers have already been mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-41.htm" title="The singers: the children of Asaph, an hundred twenty and eight.">Ezra 2:41</a>). (2) It has been thought that mention of cattle would be expected by the side of the other beasts. The suggestion has been made that we ought to read ‘oxen’ (sh’vârim) for ‘singing men’ (shôr’rim), that the latter word having been introduced by a copyist’s error, the words ‘and singing women’ were added to give completeness to the verse. The conjecture is ingenious but is based on a misapprehension. (1) The singers mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-41.htm" title="The singers: the children of Asaph, an hundred twenty and eight.">Ezra 2:41</a> are a Levitical guild, set apart for the Temple services. The singers mentioned here are professionals employed at banquets, feasts &c., or funerals (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-25.htm" title="And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>). Such ‘singing men and singing women’ often belonged to the most degraded class. There is nothing strange then in their being mentioned after the menservants and maidservants. A passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/2-7.htm" title="I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:...">Ecclesiastes 2:7-8</a> exemplifies their position ‘I bought menservants and maidens …; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks …: I gathered me also silver and gold …: I gat me <span class="ital">men singers and women singers</span> and the delights of the sons of men, concubines very many.’ The possession of professional singers was clearly a sign of luxury (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-35.htm" title="I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?">2 Samuel 19:35</a>). The mention of them shows that there were several very wealthy men among the ‘congregation’. But it is only natural that their place in the list should follow after the mention of the ordinary servants. (2) There is no need here to introduce ‘cattle’. The animals mentioned in the context are beasts of burden (see chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-4.htm" title="And whoever remains in any place where he sojournes, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.">Ezra 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-6.htm" title="And all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was willingly offered.">Ezra 1:6</a>). ‘Oxen’ would be out of place in the list. We are told nothing of the flocks and herds, which the people brought with them. And if it be objected that oxen were used as beasts of burden, it may fairly be answered (<span class="ital">a</span>) that they would scarcely be mentioned first in the list, (<span class="ital">b</span>) that where they are found in a list (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-40.htm" title="Moreover they that were near them, even to Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.">1 Chronicles 12:40</a>) they are mentioned last and by a different name. The number of singers here mentioned is 200. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-67.htm" title="Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.">Nehemiah 7:67</a> and <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/5-42.htm" title="Their menservants and handmaids were seven thousand three hundred forty and seven: the singing men and singing women, two hundred forty and five:">1Es 5:42</a> it is 245, in all probability a copyist’s error whose eye had caught the number ‘245’ in the verse following.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 65.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two hundred singing men and singing women</span>. Nehemiah says two hundred <span class="accented">and forty-five</span>, and so the apocryphal Esdras. Perhaps, in the great default of Levites, the services of these persons may have been used to swell the sacred choruses of the time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>). Hence, it may be, the mention of this otherwise unimportant fact. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Those who went up with, but could not prove that they pertained to, the nation of Israel.

These went up, with those who returned, from Tel-melah (Salthill) and Tel-harsa (Thicket or Forest Hill), names of Babylonian districts or regions, the situations of which cannot be ascertained. The words also which follow, &#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1512; &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1503; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, are obscure, but are certainly not the names of individuals, the persons who went up not being specified till <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-60.htm">Ezra 2:60</a>. The words are names of places, but it is uncertain whether the three are used to express one or three places. In favour of the notion that they designate but one locality, may be alleged that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-60.htm">Ezra 2:60</a> only three races are named, which would then correspond with the districts named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-59.htm">Ezra 2:59</a> : Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, and Cherub-Addan-Immer; a race from each district joining those who went up to Jerusalem. The three last words, however, may also designate three places in close proximity, in which one of the races of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-60.htm">Ezra 2:60</a> might be dwelling. These could not show their father's house and their seed, i.e., genealogy, whether they were of Israel. &#1492;&#1501;, as well as the suffixes of &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1501; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, refers to the persons named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-60.htm">Ezra 2:60</a>. They could not show that the houses of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda, after which they were called, belonged to Israel, nor that they themselves were of Israelitish origin. Cler. well remarks: Judaicam religionem dudum sequebantur, quam ob rem se Judaeos censebant; quamvis non possent genealogicas ullas tabulas ostendere, ex quibus constaret, ex Hebraeis oriundos esse. One of these names, Nekoda, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-48.htm">Ezra 2:48</a>, occurring among those of the Nethinim, Bertheau conjectures that while the sons of Nekoda here spoken of claimed to belong to Israel, the objection was made that they might belong to the sons of Nekoda mentioned <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-48.htm">Ezra 2:48</a>, and ought therefore to be reckoned among the Nethinim. Similar objections may have been made to the two other houses. Although they could not prove their Israelite origin, they were permitted to go up to Jerusalem with the rest, the rights of citizenship alone being for the present withheld. Hence we meet with none of these names either in the enumeration of the heads and houses of the people, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-15.htm">Nehemiah 10:15-28</a>, or in the list <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10-25.htm">Ezra 10:25-43</a>. </body></html>
