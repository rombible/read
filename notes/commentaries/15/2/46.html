The priests&#8212;Each of their families was ranged under its prince or head, like those of the other tribes. It will be remembered that the whole body was divided into twenty-four courses, one of which, in rotation, discharged the sacerdotal duties every week, and each division was called after the name of its first prince or chief. It appears from this passage that only four of the courses of the priests returned from the Babylonish captivity; but these four courses were afterwards, as the families increased, divided into twenty-four, which were distinguished by the names of the original courses appointed by David [1Ch 23:6-13]. Hence we find the course of Abijah or Abia (1Ch 24:10) subsisting at the commencement of the Christian era (Lu 1:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Nethinims,....

The addition, "of the sons of Hodaviah," belongs to Kadmiel, to distinguish him from other Levites of similar name. Jeshua and Kadmiel were, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/3-9.htm">Ezra 3:9</a>, chiefs of two orders of Levites in the times of Zerubbabel and Joshua. These names recur as names of orders of Levites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-10.htm">Nehemiah 10:10</a>. We do not find the sons of Hodaviah in the lists of Levites in Chronicles.</body></html>
