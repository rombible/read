The sum-total of these amounting only to 392, each family could only have averaged from eight to nine individuals. The sons of Akkub, Hagab and Asnah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-45.htm">Ezra 2:45</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-46.htm">Ezra 2:46</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-50.htm">Ezra 2:50</a>), are omitted in Nehemiah; the name Shalmai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-46.htm">Ezra 2:46</a>) is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-48.htm">Nehemiah 7:48</a> written Salmai; and for &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-50.htm">Ezra 2:50</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-52.htm">Nehemiah 7:52</a> has &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, a form combined from &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;. All other variations relate only to differences of form. Because Ziha (&#1510;&#1497;&#1492;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-43.htm">Ezra 2:43</a>) again occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-21.htm">Nehemiah 11:21</a> as one of the chiefs of the Nethinim, and the names following seem to stand in the same series with it, Bertheau insists on regarding these names as those of divisions. This cannot, however, be correct; for Ziha is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-21.htm">Nehemiah 11:21</a> the name of an individual, and in the present list also the proper names are those of individuals, and only the sons of Ziha, Hasupha, etc., can be called families or divisions. Plural words alone, Mehunim and Nephisim, are names of races or nations; hence the sons of the Mehunim signify individuals belonging to the Mehunim, who, perhaps, after the victory of King Uzziah over that people, were as prisoners of war made vassals for the service of the sanctuary. So likewise may the sons of the Nephisim have been prisoners of war of the Ishmaelite race &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;. Most of the families here named may, however, have been descendants of the Gibeonites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>). The servants of Solomon must not be identified with the Canaanite bond-servants mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">2 Chronicles 8:7</a>., but were probably prisoners of war of some other nation, whom Solomon sentenced to perform, as bondsmen, similar services to those imposed upon the Gibeonites. The sons of these servants are again mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3</a>. In other passages they are comprised under the general term Nethinim, with whom they are here computed. Among the names, that of &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-57.htm">Ezra 2:57</a>), i.e., catcher of gazelles, is a singular one; the last name, &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;, is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-59.htm">Nehemiah 7:59</a> &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. </body></html>
