The Lord will carry us through all undertakings entered on according to his will, with an aim to his glory, and dependence on his assistance.

Comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-63.htm">Nehemiah 7:63-65</a>. - Three such families are named: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai. These could not discover their family registers, and were excluded from the exercise of priestly functions. Of these three names, that of Hakkoz occurs as the seventh order of priests; but the names alone did not suffice to prove their priesthood, this being also borne by other persons. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-4.htm">Nehemiah 3:4</a>. The sons of Barzillai were the descendants of a priest who had married a daughter, probably an heiress (Num), of Barzillai the Gileadite, so well known in the history of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-32.htm">2 Samuel 19:32-39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-7.htm">1 Kings 2:7</a>), and had taken her name for the sake of taking possession of her inheritance (the suffix &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501; refers to &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;; see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>). That by contracting this marriage he had not renounced for himself and his descendants his priestly privileges, is evident from the fact, that when his posterity returned from captivity, they laid claim to these privileges. The assumption, however, of the name of Barzillai might have cast such a doubt upon their priestly origin as to make it necessary that this should be proved from the genealogical registers, and a search in these did not lead to the desired discovery. &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1501; is their &#1505;&#1508;&#1512; &#1497;&#1495;&#1513;&#1474;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-5.htm">Nehemiah 7:5</a>, the book or record in which their genealogy was registered.
