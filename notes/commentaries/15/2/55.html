They were probably inferior to the Nethinims, but are generally classed with them, as in the general enumeration here. Both these classes retained during their captivity their attachment to the service into which they had been received; and, the Levites being so few, their value in the reconstitution of the Temple gave them the special importance they assume in these books.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezra/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-55.htm" title="The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Peruda,">Ezra 2:55</a></span>. <span class="ital">The children of Solomon’s servants — </span>Who had lived in Solomon’s family, and after his death called themselves and their families by that name, esteeming it a great honour that they had been servants to so great a prince.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:36-63 Those who undervalue their relation to the Lord in times of reproach, persecution, or distress, will have no benefit from it when it becomes honourable or profitable.

They are apparently included under the more general term Nethinim in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-28.htm" title="And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands to the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge, and having understanding;">Nehemiah 10:28</a>. They have been traditionally understood to be the descendants of those inhabitants of the land ‘that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites’ of whom Solomon had hired ‘bondservants’ for the work of building his temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm" title="And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.">1 Kings 5:13</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 55.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Solomon's servants</span>. Solomon formed the remnant of the Canaanitish population which survived at his day into a separate servile class, which he employed in forced labours (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20, 21</a>). It would seem that the descendants of these persons, having been carried into captivity by the Chaldaeans, continued to form a distinct class, and had become attached to the sacerdotal order, as a body of <span class="accented">hieroduli</span> inferior even to the Nethinims. We may account for their special mention at this time by the importance of their services, when such a work as that of rebuilding the temple was about to be taken in hand. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Nethinim, i.e., temple-bondsmen, and the servants of Solomon, are reckoned together, thirty-five families of Nethinim and ten of the servants of Solomon being specified. The sum-total of these amounting only to 392, each family could only have averaged from eight to nine individuals. The sons of Akkub, Hagab and Asnah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-45.htm">Ezra 2:45</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-46.htm">Ezra 2:46</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-50.htm">Ezra 2:50</a>), are omitted in Nehemiah; the name Shalmai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-46.htm">Ezra 2:46</a>) is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-48.htm">Nehemiah 7:48</a> written Salmai; and for &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-50.htm">Ezra 2:50</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-52.htm">Nehemiah 7:52</a> has &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, a form combined from &#1504;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;. All other variations relate only to differences of form. Because Ziha (&#1510;&#1497;&#1492;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-43.htm">Ezra 2:43</a>) again occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-21.htm">Nehemiah 11:21</a> as one of the chiefs of the Nethinim, and the names following seem to stand in the same series with it, Bertheau insists on regarding these names as those of divisions. This cannot, however, be correct; for Ziha is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-21.htm">Nehemiah 11:21</a> the name of an individual, and in the present list also the proper names are those of individuals, and only the sons of Ziha, Hasupha, etc., can be called families or divisions. Plural words alone, Mehunim and Nephisim, are names of races or nations; hence the sons of the Mehunim signify individuals belonging to the Mehunim, who, perhaps, after the victory of King Uzziah over that people, were as prisoners of war made vassals for the service of the sanctuary. So likewise may the sons of the Nephisim have been prisoners of war of the Ishmaelite race &#1504;&#1508;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;. Most of the families here named may, however, have been descendants of the Gibeonites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>). The servants of Solomon must not be identified with the Canaanite bond-servants mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-7.htm">2 Chronicles 8:7</a>., but were probably prisoners of war of some other nation, whom Solomon sentenced to perform, as bondsmen, similar services to those imposed upon the Gibeonites. The sons of these servants are again mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3</a>. In other passages they are comprised under the general term Nethinim, with whom they are here computed. Among the names, that of &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-57.htm">Ezra 2:57</a>), i.e., catcher of gazelles, is a singular one; the last name, &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;, is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-59.htm">Nehemiah 7:59</a> &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;. </body></html>
