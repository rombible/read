They reveal a state of apathy which Ezra does not allude to; such a state of things, in fact, as would have thwarted the whole design of Providence had it not been changed. Hence the abrupt return of the spirit of prophecy, some of the last utterances of which provoked or “stirred up “—as Cyrus had been stirred up—the spirit of the two leaders and of the heads of the families.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezra/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-1.htm" title="Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them.">Ezra 5:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Haggai and Zechariah — </span>Concerning these prophets, see the books which bear their names. They are both thought to have been born at Babylon during the captivity, and both with united zeal encouraged the people to go on with the work of the temple. Upon the accession of Darius to the throne, Haggai, in particular, by reproaching the people with their indolence and insensibility; by telling them that they were careful enough to lodge themselves very commodiously, while the house of the Lord lay buried in its ruins; and by putting them in mind that the calamities of drought and famine, wherewith God had afflicted them since their return, were owing to their neglect in repairing the temple, prevailed with them to set about the work in good earnest; so that, by virtue of these reproofs, as well as some encouragements which God occasionally authorized him to give them, they brought the whole to a conclusion in a short time. <span class="ital">The son of Iddo — </span>That is, the grandson; for Zechariah was the son of Barachiah. <span class="ital">Prophesied unto the Jews </span>— Commanding them from God to return to building the temple, with a promise of his favour and assistance.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1,2 The building of the temple was stopped about fifteen years.

It is a sign that God has mercy in store for a people, when he raises up prophets to be helpers in the way and work of God, as guides, overseers, and rulers. In Haggai, we see what great things God does by his word, which he magnifies above all his name, and by his Spirit working with it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Haggai and Zechariah stirred up Zerubbabel and Joshua Ezr 5:2; <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>, and warned the people against neglecting the building of the temple, in order to give themselves to the beautifying of their own houses (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/haggai/1-4.htm">Haggai 1:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-9.htm">Haggai 1:9</a>).

Then the prophets &#8230; prophesied &#8230; in the name of the God of Israel&#8212;From the recorded writings of Haggai and Zechariah, it appears that the difficulties experienced and the many obstacles thrown in the way had first cooled the zeal of the Jews in the building of the temple, and then led to an abandonment of the work, under a pretended belief that the time for rebuilding it had not yet come (Hag 1:2-11). For fifteen years the work was completely suspended. These two prophets upbraided them with severe reproaches for their sloth, negligence, and worldly selfishness (Hag 1:4), threatened them with severe judgments if they continued backward, and promised that they would be blessed with great national prosperity if they resumed and prosecuted the work with alacrity and vigor.<p>Zechariah the son of Iddo&#8212;that is, grandson (Zec 1:1).Zerubbabel, being encouraged by Haggai and Zechariah the prophets, setteth forward the work, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-1.htm" title="Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them.">Ezra 5:1</a>2</span>.

The short extant book of Haggai’s prophecy combines reproof for the neglect with encouragement for the renewal of the work on the Temple. The book preserves prophecies uttered in the second year of Darius, (1) on the first day of the sixth month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-1.htm" title="Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,">Ezra 1:1</a>), (2) on the twenty-first day of the seventh month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm" title="Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and came again to Jerusalem and Judah, every one to his city;">Ezra 2:1</a>), (3) on the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-10.htm" title="The children of Bani, six hundred forty and two.">Ezra 2:10</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Zechariah the son of Iddo</span>] cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-14.htm" title="And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-1.htm" title="In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,">Zechariah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-7.htm" title="On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,">Zechariah 1:7</a> he is called ‘Zechariah the son of Berechiah the son of Iddo the prophet’. An ‘Iddo’ is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-4.htm" title="Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,">Nehemiah 12:4</a> among the heads of priestly families that returned with Zerubbabel and Jeshua: again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-16.htm" title="Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;">Nehemiah 12:16</a> we find a Zechariah mentioned as the son of Iddo and the head of a priestly house, in the days of Nehemiah. Zechariah was probably the grandson of Iddo, and in the genealogies called in preference ‘the son of Iddo’ rather than ‘the son of Berechiah’, either on account of his father’s early death, or because the name of ‘Zechariah the son of Berechiah’ would have been liable to confusion with ‘Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-2.htm" title="And I took to me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.">Isaiah 8:2</a>). In the same way Laban is called the son of Nahor, not of Bethuel (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-47.htm" title="And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him: and I put the earring on her face, and the bracelets on her hands.">Genesis 24:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-5.htm" title="And he said to them, Know you Laban the son of Nahor?

The date given to the first prophecy in his book is the eighth month of the second year of king Darius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-1.htm" title="In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,">Zechariah 1:1</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jews that</span> were <span class="ital">in Judah and Jerusalem</span>] i.e. as distinguished from the Jews that were in the Captivity in Babylon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the name of the God of Israel,</span> even <span class="ital">unto them</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">in the name of the God of Israel</span> prophesied they <span class="ital">unto them</span>. R.V. marg. <span class="ital">in the name of the God of Israel</span> which was <span class="ital">upon them</span>. The words ‘unto’ or ‘upon them’ close the verse strangely. The R.V. text expresses with greater distinctness the rendering of the A.V. ‘unto them’. The rendering of the R.V. margin ‘which was upon them’ (i.e. the name of the God of Israel) although a harsh condensed expression, seems preferable. It is not at first sight evident who are intended by ‘upon them’. Most commentators accepting this rendering explain the words as having reference to the two prophets, and illustrate them by <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-16.htm" title="Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.">Jeremiah 15:16</a>, ‘Thy word was unto me a joy and the rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by Thy name, O Lord God of hosts.’ This indeed is very possible. But the other explanation, which refers ‘which was upon them’ to ‘the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem’, seems most suited to the context. Not the ground of the personal courage of the two prophets, but the basis of their prophetic appeal, i.e. the spiritual calling of the nation, is the purport of the phrase. The prophets prophesied to the Jews in the name of the God Who had chosen them, Whose Name was called upon them. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/43-5.htm" title="Fear not: for I am with you: I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west;...">Isaiah 43:5-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-19.htm" title="We are yours: you never bore rule over them; they were not called by your name.">Isaiah 63:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-1.htm" title="I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.">Isaiah 65:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-10.htm" title="And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?">Jeremiah 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore will I do to this house, which is called by my name, wherein you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.">Jeremiah 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-30.htm" title="For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, said the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.">Jeremiah 7:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/9-18.htm" title="O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by your name: for we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousnesses, but for your great mercies....">Daniel 9:18-19</a>.
