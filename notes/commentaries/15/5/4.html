This should keep us to our duty, and encourage us therein, when difficulties are ever so discouraging. The elders of the Jews gave the Samaritans an account of their proceedings. Let us learn hence, with meekness and fear, to give a reason of the hope that is in us; let us rightly understand, and then readily declare, what we do in God's service, and why we do it. And while in this world, we always shall have to confess, that our sins have provoked the wrath of God. All our sufferings spring from thence, and all our comforts from his unmerited mercy. However the work may seem to be hindered, yet the Lord Jesus Christ is carrying it on, his people are growing unto a holy temple in the Lord, for a habitation of God through the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then said we - The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions have "Then said they," which brings this verse into exact accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-10.htm">Ezra 5:10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3, 4. At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river&#8212;The Persian empire west of the Euphrates included at this time Syria, Arabia, Egypt, Phœnicia, and other provinces subject to Darius. The empire was divided into twenty provinces, called satrapies. Syria formed one satrapy, inclusive of Palestine, Phœnicia, and Cyprus, and furnished an annual revenue of three hundred fifty talents. It was presided over by a satrap or viceroy, who at this time resided at Damascus. Though superior to the native governors of the Jews appointed by the Persian king, he never interfered with their internal government except when there was a threatened disturbance of order and tranquillity. Tatnai, the governor (whether this was a personal name or an official title is unknown), had probably been incited by the complaints and turbulent outrages of the Samaritans against the Jews; but he suspended his judgment, and he prudently resolved to repair to Jerusalem, that he might ascertain the real state of matters by personal inspection and enquiry, in company with another dignified officer and his provincial council.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then said we; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

In answer to their questions; namely, Ezra and other Jews replied; for though Ezra is said after this to come from Babylon in the seventh year of Artaxerxes, he might go thither on some business, and then return again at that time; some indeed think these are the words of Tatnai and those with him; so Ben Melech, which seems to be favoured by <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-10.htm">Ezra 4:10</a>, and by reading the words with an interrogation, as we do; Aben Ezra says they are either the words of the builders, or of the scribes, the secretaries that came to question them; but they are the words of the former, as order requires, or otherwise no answer would be returned, at least as expressed; and the next clause may be read without an interrogation, and the sense be, that they told them not only that they acted according to an edict of Cyrus king of Persia, for this was said, as appears from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-13.htm">Ezra 5:13</a>, but they declared <p>what were the names of the men that did make this building; or employed them in it, namely, Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the chief men of the Jews; they made no scruple of telling them who they were; neither ashamed of their masters nor of their work, nor afraid of any ill consequences following hereafter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezra/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?</span><p>(b) That is, the enemies asked this, as in Ezr 5:10.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezra/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">Then said we unto them</span>, &c.] R.V. <span class="bld">Then spake we unto them after this manner, What,</span> &c.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-10.htm" title="We asked their names also, to certify you, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.">Ezra 5:10</a>.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) The reading followed in the A.V. and R.V. is practically unintelligible. ‘Then spake we’ would naturally <span class="bld">introduce the Jews</span>’ reply (the first person being remarkable, but quite intelligible): but the question, ‘What are the names of the men that make this building?’ is as obviously the question of the governor. It is equally impossible to apply ‘we’ to the governor and his companions, and to see in ‘Then spake we unto them’, &c. a continuance of ‘came Tattenai’, &c. The only possible rendering is, ‘Then spake we unto them after this manner (with reference to the question), What are’, &c. But the ellipse is so harsh as to make this, even if it were grammatically possible, inadmissible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) On the other hand, the alternative reading, given as the second alternative in the Margin of the R.V., supplies the sense needed by the context, i.e. ‘They said’. This is supported by the LXX. (<span class="greekheb">τότε ταῦτα εἴποσαν αὐτοῖς</span>) and the Peshitto Syriac. It is also supported by internal evidence. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-3.htm" title="At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said thus to them, Who has commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?">Ezra 5:3</a>, Tattenai and his friends ask the first question relating to official permission; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-4.htm" title="Then said we to them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building?">Ezra 5:4</a> (according to the emended reading) they ask a further question, as to the names of the Jewish leaders. To neither question is the answer of the Jews directly recorded, since the substance of their answers is reported in the letter to Darius (2–16). That letter mentions also the interrogatories. The first interrogation is repeated verbatim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-9.htm" title="Then asked we those elders, and said to them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?">Ezra 5:9</a>). The second is described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-10.htm" title="We asked their names also, to certify you, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.">Ezra 5:10</a>), ‘<span class="ital">We</span> asked <span class="ital">them</span> their names also’, in a manner exactly corresponding to the present verse, Then spake <span class="ital">they</span> unto <span class="ital">them</span> after this manner, What are the names?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The emendation, it must be admitted, is the easier reading, and is therefore perhaps to be suspected as a correction. But it is impossible to accept the A.V. text as representing the original. It is best to receive the reading of the LXX. ‘They said’, and to regard the reading ‘we said’, as a very early error of a scribe who by a natural mistake began to write the 4th verse as the answer in a dialogue.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">What are the names</span>, &c.] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-10.htm" title="We asked their names also, to certify you, that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them.">Ezra 5:10</a>, ‘the names of the men that were at the head of them’.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This enquiry would hardly have been made if the correspondence recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/4-7.htm" title="And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue....">Ezra 4:7-23</a> had taken place in the seven months’ reign of Pseudo-Smerdis, and had brought official investigation so recently to bear upon the affairs of Jerusalem.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said we unto them.</span> It is impossible that the existing text can be sound here.
