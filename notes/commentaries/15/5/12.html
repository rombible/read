This should keep us to our duty, and encourage us therein, when difficulties are ever so discouraging. The elders of the Jews gave the Samaritans an account of their proceedings. Let us learn hence, with meekness and fear, to give a reason of the hope that is in us; let us rightly understand, and then readily declare, what we do in God's service, and why we do it. And while in this world, we always shall have to confess, that our sins have provoked the wrath of God. All our sufferings spring from thence, and all our comforts from his unmerited mercy.

Mainly by their long series of idolatries, with the moral abominations that those idolatries involved - the sacrifice of children by their own parents, the licentious rites belonging to the worship of Baal, and the unmentionable horrors practised by the devotees of the Dea Syra. For centuries, with only short and rare intervals, "the chief of the priests, and the people, had transgressed very much after <span class="accented">all</span> the abominations of the heathen," and had even "polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon</span>. He punished, as he always does, national apostasy with national destruction. Making an idolatrous people, but a less guilty one, his sword, he cut off Judah, as he had previously cut off Israel, causing the national life to cease, and even removing the bulk of the people into a distant country. Not by his own power or might did Nebuchadnezzar prevail. God could have delivered the Jews from him as easily as he had delivered them in former days from Jabin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2-24</a>), and from Zerah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11-15</a>), and from Sennacherib (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20-36</a>). But he was otherwise minded; he "<span class="accented">gave them into the hand</span> of Nebuchadnezzar" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>). He divided their counsels, paralysed their resistance, caused Pharaoh Hophra to desert their cause (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-7.htm">2 Kings 24:7</a>), and left them helpless and unprotected. Nebuchadnczzar was his instrument to chastise his guilty people, and in pursuing his own ends merely worked out the purposes of the Almighty. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-6.htm">Ezra 5:6-17</a> follows the letter which the royal officials sent to the king. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-6.htm">Ezra 5:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-7.htm">Ezra 5:7</a> form the introduction to this document, and correspond with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-8.htm">Ezra 5:8-11</a> in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4.htm">Ezra 4</a>. Copy of the letter (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-11.htm">Ezra 4:11</a>) which Tatnai, etc., sent. The senders of the letter are, besides Tatnai, Shethar-Boznai and his companions the Apharsachites, the same called <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9</a> the Apharsathchites, who perhaps, as a race specially devoted to the Persian king, took a prominent position among the settlers in Syria, and may have formed the royal garrison. After this general announcement of the letter, follows the more precise statement: They sent the matter to him; and in it was written, To King Darius, much peace. &#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1490;&#1468;&#1503; here is not command, but matter; see above. &#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488;, its totality, is unconnected with, yet dependent on &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488;: peace in all things, in every respect. The letter itself begins with a simple representation of the state of affairs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-8.htm">Ezra 5:8</a>): "We went into the province of Judaea, to the house of the great God (for so might Persian officials speak of the God of Israel, after what they had learned from the elders of Judah of the edict of Cyrus), and it is being built with freestone, and timber is laid in the walls; and this work is being diligently carried on, and is prospering under their hands." The placing of wood in the walls refers to building beams into the wall for flooring; for the building was not so far advanced as to make it possible that this should be said of covering the walls with wainscotting. The word &#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1488; here, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-8.htm">Ezra 6:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-12.htm">Ezra 6:12-13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-17.htm">Ezra 7:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-21.htm">Ezra 7:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-26.htm">Ezra 7:26</a>, is of Aryan origin, and is explained by Haug in Ew. Janro. v. p. 154, from the Old-Persian us-parna, to mean: carefully or exactly finished-a meaning which suits all these passages. </body></html>
