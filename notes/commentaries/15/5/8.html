This should keep us to our duty, and encourage us therein, when difficulties are ever so discouraging. The elders of the Jews gave the Samaritans an account of their proceedings. Let us learn hence, with meekness and fear, to give a reason of the hope that is in us; let us rightly understand, and then readily declare, what we do in God's service, and why we do it. And while in this world, we always shall have to confess, that our sins have provoked the wrath of God. All our sufferings spring from thence, and all our comforts from his unmerited mercy.

The A.V. gives the title ‘Judea’, which belongs to a later time, as the name of a country inhabited by the Jews. It occurs first in the Apocrypha (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/1-18.htm" title="And if the king Sennacherib had slain any, when he was come, and fled from Judea, I buried them privily; for in his wrath he killed many; but the bodies were not found, when they were sought for of the king.">Tob 1:18</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/3-34.htm" title="Moreover he delivered unto him the half of his forces, and the elephants, and gave him charge of all things that he would have done, as also concerning them that dwelt in Juda and Jerusalem:">1Ma 3:34</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/1-10.htm" title="In the hundred fourscore and eighth year, the people that were at Jerusalem and in Judea, and the council, and Judas, sent greeting and health unto Aristobulus, king Ptolemeus' master, who was of the stock of the anointed priests, and to the Jews that were in Egypt:">2Ma 1:10</a>, &c.). ‘Judah’ occurs frequently in Ezra, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-6.htm" title="And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.">Ezra 4:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-1.htm" title="Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even to them.">Ezra 5:1</a>.

It has been supposed (Pusey's 'Daniel,' p. 571), on the strength of a doubtful passage in Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-7.htm">Nehemiah 3:7</a>), that Tatnai ordinarily resided at Jernsalem. But this expression indicates the contrary. Most probably the satrap of Syria held his court at Damascus. <span class="cmt_word">The house of the great God</span> is a remarkable expression in the mouth of a heathen. It has some parallels, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the expressions of Cyrus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2, 3</a>, and of Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a> and Daniel 3:29; but they were persons who had been brought to the knowledge that Jehovah was the one true God, under very peculiar and miraculous circumstances. Tatnai, on the other hand, represents the mere ordinary Persian official; and his acknowledgment of the God of the Jews as "the great God" must be held to indicate the general belief of the Persians on the subject (see the comment on Ezra 1:2). <span class="cmt_word">Which is builded</span>. Rather, "being builded." <span class="cmt_word">With great stones.</span> Literally, "stones of rolling," which is commonly explained as stones so large that they had to be rolled along the ground. But the squared stones used in building neither were, nor could be, rolled; they are always represented as dragged, generally on a rough sledge. And it is not at all probable that in the "day of small things" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>) the Jews were building with very large stones. The LXX. translate "choice stones;" the Vulgate "unpolished" or "rough stone." Some of the Jewish expositors suggest "marble." <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">timber is laid</span>. A good deal of timber had been employed in the old temple, but chiefly for the floors of chambers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-10.htm">1 Kings 6:10</a>), for the internal lining of the walls (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 9, 15), and probably for the roofing. In the new temple, timber seems to have been employed also as the main material of the party-walls. Here again we have a trace of the economy necessary in the "day of small things." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Then rose up Zerubbabel ... and Joshua ... and began to build the house of God at Jerusalem, and with them the prophets of God helping them." The beginning to build is (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/3-6.htm">Ezra 3:6</a>, etc.) the commencement of the building properly so called, upon the foundations laid, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>; for what was done after this foundation-laying till a stop was put to the work, was so unimportant that no further notice is taken of it. The "prophets of God" are those mentioned <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-1.htm">Ezra 5:1</a>, viz., Haggai, and Zechariah the son, i.e., grandson, of Iddo, for his father's name was Berechiah (see Introd. to Zechariah). Haggai entered upon his work on the first day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius; and his first address made such an impression, that Zerubbabel and Joshua with the people set about the intermitted work of building as early as the twenty-fourth day of the same month (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>.). Two months later, viz., in the eighth month of the same year, Zechariah began to exhort the people to turn sincerely to the Lord their God, and not to relapse into the sins of their fathers. </body></html>
