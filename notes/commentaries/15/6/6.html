Achmetha&#8212;long supposed to be the capital of Greater Media (the Ecbatana of classical, the Hamadan of modern times), [is] at the foot of the Elwund range of hills, where, for its coolness and salubrity, Cyrus and his successors on the Persian throne established their summer residence. There was another city, however, of this name, the Ecbatana of Atropatene, and the most ancient capital of northern Media, and recently identified by Colonel Rawlinson in the remarkable ruins of Takht-i-Soleiman. Yet as everything tends to show the attachment of Cyrus to his native city, the Atropatenian Ecbatana, rather than to the stronger capital of Greater Media, Colonel Rawlinson is inclined to think that he deposited there, in his fortress, the famous decree relating to the Jews, along with the other records and treasures of his empire [Nineveh and Persepolis].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. From hindering or discouraging the work. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now therefore Tatnai, governor beyond the river,....

Observe the sudden change into the direct address to the governor. Darius’s decree is attached to the copy of Cyrus’s decree, without any prefatory words to mark the transition or to call attention to Darius’s action. The composition of the Compiler or of the document, which he cites, is rough and inartistic; but the meaning of the passage and its connexion with the context cannot be mistaken.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">your companions</span>] R.V. margin.

Apparently the author has not thought it necessary to put on record the whole royal letter; but only the most essential parts of it - the recitation of the decree of Cyrus, and the further decree of Darius himself. The address of the letter, the opening words, and the passage by which the two main portions were linked together, are either omitted or greatly abbreviated. <span class="cmt_word">Be ye far from thence.</span> Keep away from the Jews - do not go near them to trouble them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After thus representing the state of affairs, the royal officials request Darius to cause a search to be made among the archives of the kingdom, as to whether a decree made by Cyrus for the erection of the temple at Jerusalem was to be found therein, and then to communicate to them his decision concerning the matter. "And if it seem good to the king, let search be made in the king's treasure-house there at Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king." &#1506;&#1500; &#1496;&#1489; &#1492;&#1503;, like the Hebrew &#1506;&#1500; &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; &#1488;&#1501;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/1-19.htm">Esther 1:19</a>, for which in older Hebrew &#1500;&#1493; &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-17.htm">Deuteronomy 23:17</a>, or &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-8.htm">Genesis 19:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/10-15.htm">Judges 10:15</a>, and elsewhere, is used. &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, house of the treasure, more definitely called, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-1.htm">Ezra 6:1</a>, house of the rolls, where also the royal treasures were deposited. Hence it is obvious that important documents and writings were preserved in the royal treasury. &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, there, is explained by "which at Babylon." &#1512;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, chald. voluntas, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-18.htm">Ezra 7:18</a>. Concerning the behaviour of these officials Brentius well remarks: vides differentiam inter calumniatores et bonos ac probos viros. Una eademque causa erat aedificii templi, unus idemque populus Judaeorum; attamen hujus populi causa aliter refertur ab impiis calumniatoribus, aliter a bonis viris. </body></html>
