I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.">Ezra 6:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">The God that hath caused his name to dwell there — </span>Who hath willed that a temple should be built there, called the temple or house of Jehovah. <span class="ital">Destroy all kings and people that shall put to their hand to alter,</span> &c. — Darius was touched with such a sense of the greatness of the God of the Jews, that he prays, that He who had all power in heaven and earth, and was King of kings, would not only punish all those kings who went about to obstruct this work, but destroy both them and their people. Though this temple was at length most justly destroyed by the righteous hand of God, yet perhaps the Romans, who were the instruments of that destruction, felt the effects of this curse. For that empire sensibly declined ever after, till it was wholly destroyed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here let us admire, how the divine providence overruleth every thing according to its purpose, to bring about all its wise designs. The great men, we here find, stood up against the poor and shattered remnant of Judah; they took counsel together how to oppress them, and keep them down. They laid their plans, exhibited their complaints against them, and thought to overturn them: but, quite contrary to their thoughts, the steps they took for this purpose operated the contrary way, and proved the means of exalting and raising those whom they intended to ruin to a higher pitch of power and pre-eminence. The king, whose governors these men were, and to whom, undoubtedly, they represented how much it was for his interest to put a stop to the rise of Judah, instead of hearkening to their complaints, as was natural, and acting accordingly, sent back a decree, not only forbidding them to molest the Jews in any way, but also granting them the most extraordinary privileges and encouragements, as to the greatest favourites. To what can we attribute this extraordinary behaviour in the king: but to an overruling providence? which ruleth even the hearts of kings, and turneth them as it seemeth best to his sovereign wisdom.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:1-12 When God's time is come for fulfilling his gracious purposes concerning his church, he will raise up instruments to do it, from whom such good service was not expected. While our thoughts are directed to this event, we are led by Zechariah to fix our regard on a nobler, a spiritual building. The Lord Jesus Christ continues to lay one stone upon another: let us assist the great design. Difficulties delay the progress of this sacred edifice. Yet let not opposition discourage us, for in due season it will be completed to his abundant praise. He shall bring forth the head-stone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Destroy all - A similar malediction is found at the end of the great inscription of this same king Darius at Behistun: If anyone injures the tablet which he has set up, he prays that Ormazd will be their enemy, and that they may have no offspring, and that whatever they do, Ormazd may curse it for them.<p>To alter and to destroy this house - i. e., to alter the decree, and then proceed to destroy the house. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezra/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11, 12. whosoever shall alter this word&#8212;The warning was specially directed against the turbulent and fanatical Samaritans. The extremely favorable purport of this edict was no doubt owing in some measure to the influence of Cyrus, of whom Darius entertained a high admiration, and whose two daughters he had married. But it proceeded still more from the deep impressions made even on the idolatrous people of that country and that age, as to the being and providence of the God of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezra/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there,....

On the contrary, they were to promote it by furnishing what was necessary for the work, and paying the expenses of the building out of the royal revenues to the elders of the Jews (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-6.htm">Ezra 6:6-8</a>). They were also to provide for the worship of God in this temple such animals as the priests should require for sacrifice (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-9.htm">Ezra 6:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-10.htm">Ezra 6:10</a>), under pain of severe punishment for transgressing this command as also for any injury done to the temple (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-11.htm">Ezra 6:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-12.htm">Ezra 6:12</a>). This decree was undoubtedly communicated to the governor in the form of a written answer to his inquiries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-13.htm">Ezra 6:13</a>). Without, however, expressly stating this to be the case, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-1.htm">Ezra 6:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-17.htm">Ezra 4:17</a> would lead us to expect, the historian gives us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-6.htm">Ezra 6:6</a>. the actual contents of the royal edict, and that in the form of a direct injunction to the governor and his associates on this side the river: "Now Tatnai, governor, ... be ye far from thence." The suffix &#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1503;, and their associates, is indeed unsuitable to the form of an address, of which Tatnai and Shethar-Boznai are the subjects; the narrator, however, in using it, had in mind the title or introduction of the royal letter.
