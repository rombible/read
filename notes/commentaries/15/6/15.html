Haggai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-15.htm" title="In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.">Haggai 1:15</a>) gives the exact date of the re-commencement: the time therefore was four years five months and ten days. But, dating from the first foundation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm" title="And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.">Ezra 3:10</a>), no less than twenty-one years had elapsed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezra/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-15.htm" title="And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.">Ezra 6:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">This house was finished in the third day of the month Adar — </span>The tenth of March, in the year of the world 3489, in little more than four years after the Jews had returned to the work, and engaged heartily in it, in consequence of the reproofs and exhortations of Haggai and Zechariah; in something more than two years after the forementioned decree of Darius had been given forth; in about twenty years after the return from captivity; and five hundred and fifteen before the coming of the Messiah.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:13-22 The gospel church, that spiritual temple, is long in the building, but it will be finished at last, when the mystical body is completed. Every believer is a living temple, building up himself in his most holy faith: much opposition is given to this work by Satan and our own corruptions. We trifle, and proceed in it with many stops and pauses; but He that has begun the good work, will see it performed. Then spirits of just men will be made perfect. By getting their sins taken away, the Jews would free themselves from the sting of their late troubles. Their service was with joy. Let us welcome holy ordinances with joy, and serve the Lord with gladness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezra/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Adar" was the twelfth or last month of the Jewish year, corresponding nearly with our March.

The date here given is the 3rd of Adar (the 12th month) in the 6th year of Darius (516–515). The month Adar is about equivalent to our March. The name seems to be derived from an Assyrian god ‘Adar’, which appears in such names as Adrammelech. Haggai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-15.htm" title="In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.">Haggai 1:15</a>) mentions that the work had been recommenced on the 24th day of the 6th month (Elul = September) in the 2nd year of Darius. It had therefore been going on for nearly 4½ years. But the foundations had been laid twenty years previously, b.c. 536 (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-8.htm" title="Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity to Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD.">Ezra 3:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another date, the 23rd of Adar, is given in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/7-5.htm" title="And thus was the holy house finished in the three and twentieth day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of Darius king of the Persians">1Es 7:5</a>. To account for this variation, it has been suggested that the last 8 days of the year would to a scribe seem best suited for the celebration of such a festival as that of the dedication (compare the 8 days in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-17.htm" title="Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.">2 Chronicles 29:17</a>). In order that the regular services of the Temple might seem to have been resumed with the new year, he represented this festival as commencing on the 23rd of the 12th month. This is almost too ingenious. Either the figure ‘twenty’ has accidentally been omitted in the text of our verse, or, as seems equally probable (since the LXX. supports the Hebrew text here), the composer of 1 Esdras has mistaken some letter for the symbol or contraction which represented the number.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house was finished on the third day of the month Adar. Haggai</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a>) gives the exact day of the recommencement of the work as the twenty-fourth of Elul in Darius's second year. Ezra here gives the exact day of the completion. From Zerubbabel's laying of the foundation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>), the time that had elapsed was twenty-one years. From the recommencement under the inspiriting influence of the two prophets, the time was only four years, five months, and ten days. DEDICATION OF THE SECOND TEMPLE (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-18</a>). Following the example of Solomon, who had solemnly "dedicated" the first temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>), and had offered on the occasion a sacrifice unexampled for its magnitude in the whole of Jewish history (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>), Zerubbabel now, under the advice of two prophets, inaugurated the new building with a similar ceremony. In "the day of small things" it was not possible for him to emulate Solomon's magnificence in respect of the number of victims. Solomon had sacrificed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. Zerubbabel's means only enabled him to make an offering of 712 animals, more than half of them lambs. He did, however, according to his ability; and God, who accepts all our endeavours according to that we have, and not according to that we have not, was content to receive graciously the humble offering made to him, and to bless the building thus inaugurated with a glory unknown to the first temple. The Lord himself, the Messenger of the covenant, so long sought by his people, suddenly came to this temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>) - came to it, and frequented it, and taught in it, and gave it a dignity and a majesty far beyond the first temple, which possessed indeed the Shechinah, but was once, and once only, vouchsafed a brief manifestation of the actual Divine presence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And what is needful, both young bullocks and rams and lambs, for the burnt-offerings of the God of leaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests at Jerusalem (i.e., as the priests shall require for the service of God), let it be given them day by day without fail." &#1502;&#1492; is joined with the plur. fem. of the partic. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1503;, and is defined by the enumeration which follows. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;, properly the anointing, then oil as the means of anointing.
