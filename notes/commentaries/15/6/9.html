In Babylon itself the document sought for was not found; though, probably the search there made, led to the discovery of a statement that documents pertaining to the time of Cyrus were preserved in the fortress of Achmetha, where the record in question was subsequently discovered. &#1488;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1488;, the capital of Great Media - &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x395;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, Judith 1:1, 14, or &#x391;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; (Herod. i. 98) - built by Dejokes, was the summer residence of the Persian and Parthian kings, and situate in the neighbourhood of the modern Hamadan. Achmetha is probably the Old-Median or Old-Persian pronunciation of the name, the letters &#1488;&#1495;&#1501; on Sassanidian coins being explained as denoting this city (Mordtmann in the Zeitschrift der deutsch morgenl.

First, the proclamation of King Cyrus in the first year of his reign: "The house of God at Jerusalem, let this house be built as a place where sacrifices are offered." The meaning of the words following is doubtful. We translate &#1502;&#1505;&#1493;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497;: and let them raise up its foundations, i.e., its foundations are to be again raised up, restored. &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1497;&#1503;, foundations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-12.htm">Ezra 4:12</a>); &#1502;&#1505;&#1493;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;, part.

The conjecture of Bertheau, who labours, by all sorts of critical combinations of the letters in the words &#1502;&#1505;&#1493;&#1489;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1495;&#1497;, to produce the text &#1514;&#1502;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1503; &#1488;&#1513;&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;, "its foundation length 180 cubits," is as needless as it is mistaken. The interpretation of the words in the lxx, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;, and Pseudo-Ezra 6, &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;, are nothing else than unmeaning suppositions.)<p>Expositors are divided as to the dimensions of the new temple, "its height 60 cubits, and its breadth 60 cubits," Antiq. xi. 4. 6; while Solomon's temple was but 30 cubits high, and, without the side-buildings, only 20 cubits broad. We nevertheless consider the statements correct, and the text incorrupt, and explain the absence of the measure of length simply by the fact that, as far as length was concerned, the old and new temples were of equal dimensions. Solomon's temple, measured externally, inclusive of the porch and the additional building at the hinder part, was about 100 cubits long (see the ground plan in my bibl. Archaeol. Table II. fig. 1). To correspond with this length, the new temple was, according to the desire of Cyrus, to be both higher and broader, viz., 60 cubits high, and as many wide, - measurements which certainly apply to external dimensions. Zerubbabel's temple, concerning the structure of which we have no further particulars, was externally of this height and breadth. This may be inferred from the speech of King Herod in Joseph. Ant. xv. 11. 1, in which this tyrant, who desired to be famous for the magnificence of his buildings, endeavoured to gain the favour of the people for the rebuilding of the temple, which he was contemplating, by the remark that the temple built by their forefathers, on their return from the Babylonian captivity, was 60 cubits too low, - Solomon's temple having been double that height (sc. according to the height given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>, 120 cubits) - and from the fact that Herod made his temple 100 or 120 cubits high. Hence the temple of Zerubbabel, measured externally, must have been 60 cubits high; and consequently we need not diminish the breadth of 60 cubits, also given in this verse, by alterations of the text, because Herod's temple was likewise of this width, but must understand the given dimensions to relate to external height and breadth. For in Herod's temple the holy places were but 60 cubits high and 20 wide; the holy place, 40 cubits long, 20 wide, and 60 high; the holy of holies, 20 cubits long, 20 wide, and 60 high. And we may assume that the dimensions of Zerubbabel's temple preserved the same proportions, with perhaps the modification, that the internal height did not amount to 60 cubits, - an upper storey being placed above the holy place and the holy of holies, as in Herod's temple; which would make the internal height of these places amount to only about 30 or 40 cubits.<p>(Note: While we acknowledge it possible that the holy and most holy places, measured within, may have been only 40 cubits high, we cannot admit the objection of H. Merz, in Herzog's Realencycl. xv. p. 513, that 20 cubits of internal breadth is an inconceivable proportion to 60 cubits, this being the actual proportion in Herod's temple, as Merz himself states, p. 516, without finding it in this instance "inconceivable.")<p>In like manner must the 60 cubits of breadth be so divided, that the 5 cubits internal breadth of the side-buildings of Solomon's temple must be enlarged to 10, which, allowing 5 cubits of thickness for the walls, would make the entire building 60 cubits wide (5 + 10 + 5 + 20 + 5 + 10 + 5).<p>(Note: The conjecture of Merz in his above-cited article, and of Bertheau, that the dimensions of Zerubbabel's temple were double those of Solomon's, - viz. the holy and most holy places 40 cubits high and 40 wide, the upper chambers 20 cubits high, the side-chambers each 10 cubits high, and the whole building 120 cubits long, - must be rejected as erroneous, by the consideration that Herod's temple was only the length of Solomon's, viz., 100 cubits, of which the holy of holies took up 20, the holy place 40, the porch 10, the additional building behind 10, and the four walls 20. For Herod would by no means have diminished the length of his building 20, or properly 40 cubits. We also see, from the above-named dimensions, that the 60 cubits broad cannot be understood of internal breadth.)<p>The statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/6-4.htm">Ezra 6:4</a>, "three layers of great stones, and a layer of new timber," is obscure. &#1504;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1498; means row, layer, and stands in the Targums for the Hebrew &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, "used of a layer of bricks;" see Gesen. Thes. p. 311, and Levy, chald. Wrterbuch, ii. p. 93. &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500; &#1488;&#1489;&#1503;, stone of rolling, one that is rolled and cannot be carried, i.e., a great building stone. &#1495;&#1491;&#1514;, novus, as an epithet to &#1488;&#1506;, is remarkable, it being self-evident that new wood is generally used for a new building. The lxx translates &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#834;&#x3c2;, reading the word &#1495;&#1491;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3</a>). This statement involuntarily recalls the notice, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-36.htm">1 Kings 6:36</a>, that Solomon built the inner court, &#1488;&#1512;&#1494;&#1497;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1514; &#1493;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1490;&#1494;&#1497;&#1514; &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;; hence Merz expresses the supposition that "this is certainly a fragment, forming the conclusion of the whole design of the building, which, like that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-36.htm">1 Kings 6:36</a>, ends with the porch and the walls of the fore-court," Thus much only is certain, that the words are not to be understood, as by Fritzsche on 1 Esdr. 6:25, as stating that the temple walls were built of "three layers of large stones, upon which was one layer of beams," and therefore were not massive; such kind of building never being practised in the East in old times. "And let the expenses be given out of the king's house." This is more precisely stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-8.htm">Ezra 6:8</a> of the royal revenues on this side the river. &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;&#1488; the expense (from &#1504;&#1508;&#1511;, Aphel, to expend), therefore the cost of building.</body></html>
