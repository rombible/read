Achmetha&#8212;long supposed to be the capital of Greater Media (the Ecbatana of classical, the Hamadan of modern times), [is] at the foot of the Elwund range of hills, where, for its coolness and salubrity, Cyrus and his successors on the Persian throne established their summer residence. There was another city, however, of this name, the Ecbatana of Atropatene, and the most ancient capital of northern Media, and recently identified by Colonel Rawlinson in the remarkable ruins of Takht-i-Soleiman. Yet as everything tends to show the attachment of Cyrus to his native city, the Atropatenian Ecbatana, rather than to the stronger capital of Greater Media, Colonel Rawlinson is inclined to think that he deposited there, in his fortress, the famous decree relating to the Jews, along with the other records and treasures of his empire [Nineveh and Persepolis].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezra/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He did not command them to make it so large, for he left the ordering of the proportions of the building to their skill and choice; but he restrained them that they should make it no larger, lest they should hereafter make use of it to other purposes against himself: but those proportions differ much from those of Solomon’s temple, which was but thirty cubits high, only the porch was one hundred and twenty cubits high, and but twenty cubits in breadth. Either therefore Solomon’s cubits were sacred cubits, which were larger than the other, and these were but common cubits; or the sixty cubits of height are meant only of the porch, which he would not have to be so high and magnificent as that of Solomon’s was, lest they should be puffed up with it, and by degrees arrive at their former height and insolence.

(3) The rendering of the A.V. and R.V. ‘let the foundations thereof be strongly laid’ (whether passive, i.e. heavily weighted, or active, i.e. capable of bearing heavy weights), gives a fair sense, the emphasis resting upon the substantial character of the building. It may be doubted whether the text is correct. The transition from this clause to the description of the height and breadth of the building (the length being omitted) is abrupt and awkward.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The rendering of the versions shows the difficulty which the words occasioned and possibly the uncertainty of the text at a very early period. LXX. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔθηκαν ἔπαρμα</span>. Vulg. ‘ponant fundamenta supportantia’. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_esdras/6-24.htm" title="In the first year of the reign of Cyrus king Cyrus commanded that the house of the Lord at Jerusalem should be built again, where they do sacrifice with continual fire:">1Es 6:24</a> ‘With continual fire’ <span class="greekheb">διὰ πυρὸς ἐνδελεχοῦς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the height thereof</span>, &c.] In view of the uncertainty of the text, it is doubtful whether we can rely upon these statements of dimensions, especially as the length is not specified. Solomon’s temple is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm" title="And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.">1 Kings 6:2</a> as 60 cubits long, 20 broad, and 30 high. Here the temple is to be 60 cubits high and 60 broad. Josephus who, speaking of Zerubbabel’s temple, describes its height as 60 cubits less than that of Solomon’s temple, is clearly comparing the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm" title="And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>, where the porch of Solomon’s temple is said to be 120 cubits in height, with the statement of our verse. If the dimensions here given are correct, the second temple in breadth and height was much larger than the first. The comparison in respect of size could hardly account for the disparaging criticism of certain Jews alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/4-10.htm" title="For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.">Zechariah 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-3.htm" title="Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do you see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?">Haggai 2:3</a>. The view that the present verse does not give the actual dimensions but only the extreme limits to which the plan might be followed is too obviously an attempt to escape the difficulty to be at all a probable explanation.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezra/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifice.</span> Or, "the place where they may offer sacrifice." It is the future, rather than the past, which Cyrus is contemplating. <span class="cmt_word">Let the foundation thereof be strongly laid</span>. Isaiah had prophesied that Cyrus should "say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, <span class="accented">Thy foundation shall be laid"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). Cyrus adds an injunction that the foundations be laid "supportingly," or "strongly," that so the house may the longer continue. <span class="cmt_word">The height thereof threescore cubits.</span> Half the height of the first temple, according to the existing text of Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>); but one-third <span class="accented">more</span> than the previous height, as estimated by the author of Kings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the breadth thereof threescore cubits.</span> This breadth is thrice that of the main building, according to both Chronicles and Kings. It is even double that of the old temple, <span class="accented">with the side chambers</span>, which occupied a space of five cubits, or seven and a half feet, on either wing. That such an enlargement actually took effect would seem to be most improbable; and we may perhaps conclude that Cyrus designed a building on a grander scale than Zerubbabel, with the resources at his disposal, was able to erect. It is curious that Cyrus did not in his decree specify the length of the temple. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezra/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the first year, however, of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus made a decree, etc.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a>.
