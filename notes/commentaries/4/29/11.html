It was the space between harvest and seed-time. The more leisure we have from the pressing occupations of this life, the more time we should spend in the immediate service of God. The blowing of the trumpets was appointed, Le 22:24. Here they are directed what sacrifices to offer on that day. Those who would know the mind of God in the Scriptures, must compare one part with another. The latter discoveries of Divine light explain what was dark, and supply what was wanting, in the former, that the man of God may be perfect.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The offering on the great Day of Atonement was the same with that just specified.

Its institution, together with the observance to which that day was devoted, was described (Le 16:29, 30). But additional offerings seem to be noticed, namely, the large animal sacrifice for a general expiation, which was a sweet savor unto the Lord, and the sin offering to atone for the sins that mingled with that day's services. The prescriptions in this passage appear supplementary to the former statement in Leviticus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The sin-offering of atonement, </span> by which the high priest made atonement; of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-9.htm" title="And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the LORD's lot fell, and offer him for a sin offering.">Leviticus 16:9</a>,29,30</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>One kid of the goats for a sin offering,.... This also, as it was different from that which was offered for the service of the day, so it was offered after it; as is observed by the Jewish writers, that the goat, which was offered without, though of the Musaphim, or additions, could not go before the service of the day for it is said as follows: <p>beside the sin offering of atonement; hence, say they, we learn, that the goat within, which was of the service of the day, went before it (n); after that the ram of Aaron, and the ram of the people, and after that the fat of the sin offering: <p>and the continual burnt offering, and the meat offering of it, and their drink offerings; which were never omitted on account of the service of any day, though ever so solemn, as this was: hence it appears that there were offered on this day of atonement two bullocks, three rams, three goats, and two lambs. <p>(n) Bartenora in Misn.

Consequently the sacrifices presented on the seventh new moon's day were, (1) a yearling lamb in the morning and evening, with their meat-offering and drink-offering; (2) in the morning, after the daily sacrifice, the ordinary new moon's sacrifice, consisting of two bullocks, one ram, and seven yearling lambs, with their corresponding meat-offerings and drink-offerings (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-11.htm">Numbers 29:11</a>); (3) the sin-offering of the he-goat, together with the burnt-offering of one bullock, one ram, and seven yearling lambs, with their proper meat-offerings and drink-offerings, the meaning of which has been pointed out at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-23.htm">Leviticus 23:23</a>. </body></html>
