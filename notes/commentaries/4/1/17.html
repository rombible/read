It is said of each tribe, that those were numbered who were able to go forth to war; they had wars before them, though now they met with no opposition.

The numbers ascertained by the census.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There can be no doubt that the numbers given in chs. 1–3 and 26 are purely artificial. Gray (<span class="ital">Numbers</span>, pp. 10–15) shews that (1) they are impossible, (2) when compared with each other they yield absurd results, (3) they are inconsistent with numbers given in Hebrew literature earlier than P .<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) The number of male Israelites of fighting age is put at 603,550, which appears in round numbers as 600,000 in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-21.htm" title="And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.">Numbers 11:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm" title="And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.">Exodus 12:37</a>. But the fighting men could form hardly more than a quarter of the whole; so that the population would reach a total of some 2¼ millions. The present population of the Sinaitic peninsula is estimated at from 4,000 to 6,000, and a body of over 2 million people could not find subsistence even if dispersed all over the peninsula.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) The male first-born numbered 22,273 (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-43.htm" title="And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and three score and thirteen.">Numbers 3:43</a>); and it is fair to suppose that the number of families in which the first-born child was a female would be about the same, giving a total of some 44,546 families; in which case there was an average of about 50 children to a family.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-12.htm" title="And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that opens the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;">Numbers 3:12</a> we gather that the ‘first-born’ means the first-born of the <span class="ital">mother</span>, not the eldest son of a father who might have several wives. There were, therefore, 44,546 mothers. But this number (assuming that the number of women over 20 years of age was the same as that of the men, i.e. 600,000) involves the extreme improbability that only 1 in 14 women over 20 years of age had any children.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-8.htm" title="They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?">Jdg 5:8</a> the tribes of Benjamin, Ephraim. Manasseh, Naphtali, Zebulun and Issachar yielded only 40,000 persons, i.e. apparently fighting men. But in these six tribes the fighting men were 273,300 at the first census, and 301,000 at the second (Numbers 26).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, in Judges 18 it is related that the Danites had no proper territory belonging to them; and therefore 600 armed men (obviously the greater part of the tribe) migrated to the north. But the fighting men of Dan numbered 62,700 at the first census, and 64,400 at the second. See, further, the additional note at the end of the chapter.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">These men.</span> Designated by direct command of God; yet probably the same, or some of the same, selected by Moses for obvious personal and social reasons a short time before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses and Aaron, who were commanded to number, or rather to muster, the people, were to have with them "a man of every tribe, who was head-man of his fathers' houses," i.e., a tribe-prince, viz., to help them to carry out the mustering. Beth aboth ("fathers' houses"), in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a>, is a technical expression for the subdivisions in which the mishpachoth, or families of the tribes, were arranged, and is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4</a> according to its original usage, based upon the natural division of the tribes into mishpachoth and families, to the fathers' houses which every tribe possessed in the family of its first-born. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5-15</a>, these heads of tribes were mentioned by name, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-14.htm">Numbers 10:14</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-16.htm">Numbers 1:16</a> they are designated as "called men of the congregation," because they were called to diets of the congregation, as representatives of the tribes, to regulate the affairs of the nation; also "princes of the tribes of their fathers," and "heads of the thousands of Israel:" "prince," from the nobility of their birth; and "heads," as chiefs of the alaphim composing the tribes. Alaphim is equivalent to mishpachoth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-4.htm">Numbers 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-14.htm">Joshua 22:14</a>); because the number of heads of families in the mishpachoth of a tribe might easily amount to a thousand (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>). In a similar manner, the term "hundred" in the old German came to be used in several different senses (see Grimm, deutsche Rechts-alterthmer, p. 532). </body></html>
