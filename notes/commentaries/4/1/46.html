How much was required to maintain all these in the wilderness! They were all provided for by God every day. When we observe the faithfulness of God, however unlikely the performance of his promise may appear, we may take courage as to those which yet remain to be fulfilled to the church of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The enrollment, being taken principally for military purposes (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-20.htm">Numbers 1:20</a>), would naturally be arranged by hundreds, fifties, etc. (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-9.htm">2 Kings 1:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-11.htm">2 Kings 1:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-13.htm">2 Kings 1:13</a>). In eleven tribes the number enrolled consists of complete hundreds. The difference, in this respect, observable in the case of the tribe of Gad here <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-25.htm">Numbers 1:25</a>, and of the tribe of Reuben at the later census <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-7.htm">Numbers 26:7</a>, is probably to be accounted for by the pastoral, and consequently nomadic, habits of these tribes, which rendered it difficult to bring all their members together at once for a census. Judah already takes precedence of his brethren in point of numbers (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8</a> note), and Ephraim of Manasseh (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19-20</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>45, 46. all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand, &c.&#8212;What an astonishing increase from seventy-five persons who went down to Egypt about two hundred fifteen years before [see on [52]Ge 46:8], and who were subjected to the greatest privations and hardships! And yet this enumeration was restricted to men from twenty years and upwards [Nu 1:3]. Including women, children, and old men, together with the Levites, the whole population of Israel, on the ordinary principles of computation, amounted to about 2,400,000.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Even all they that were numbered,....
