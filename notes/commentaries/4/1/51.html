Singular services shall be recompensed by singular honours. It was to the honour of the Levites, that to them was committed the care of the tabernacle and its treasures, in their camps and in their marches. It was for the honour of the holy things that none should see them, or touch them, but those who were called of God to the service. We all are unfit and unworthy to have fellowship with God, till called by his grace into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and so, being the spiritual seed of that great High Priest, we are made priests to our God. Great care must be taken to prevent sin, for preventing sin is preventing wrath. Being a holy tribe, they were not reckoned among other Israelites. They that minister about holy things, should neither entangle themselves, nor be entangled, in worldly affairs. And let every believer seek to do what the Lord has commanded.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>had spoken - Render spake.

But the Levites &#8230; were not numbered among them&#8212;They were obliged to keep a register of their own. They were consecrated to the priestly office, which in all countries has been exempted customarily, and in Israel by the express authority of God, from military service. The custody of the things devoted to the divine service was assigned to them so exclusively, that "no stranger"&#8212;that is, no person, not even an Israelite of any other tribe, was allowed, under penalty of death, to approach these [Nu 16:40]. Hence they encamped round the tabernacle in order that there should be no manifestation of the divine displeasure among the people. Thus the numbering of the people was subservient to the separation of the Levites from those Israelites who were fit for military service, and to the practical introduction of the law respecting the first-born, for whom the tribe of Levi became a substitute [Ex 13:2; Nu 3:12].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">stranger</span> elsewhere is one of another nation, here one of another tribe, one no Levite.

This is the first intimation given of the extreme and awful sanctity of the tabernacle, as the tent of the Divine Presence. It is, however, quite of a piece with the anxious warnings against intrusion upon the holy mount at the time of the giving of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-21.htm">Exodus 19:21</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span>). The great necessity for Israel was that he should understand and believe that <span class="accented">the Lord</span> before whom he had trembled at Sinai was really in the midst of him in all his travail and his danger. This could only be impressed <span class="cmt_word">upon</span> his dull mind and hard heart by surrounding the presence chamber of Jehovah with awful sanctities and terrors. At a subsequent period, when the religious reverence here thrown around the tabernacle had been transferred to, or rather concentrated upon, the ark alone, Uzzah was actually smitten for breaking this law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-10.htm">1 Chronicles 13:10</a>). The tumult raised against St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span>) was justified by a supposed violation of the same. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This command was carried out by Moses and Aaron.
