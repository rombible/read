It is said of each tribe, that those were numbered who were able to go forth to war; they had wars before them, though now they met with no opposition. Let the believer be prepared to withstand the enemies of his soul, though all may appear to be peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The enrollment, being taken principally for military purposes (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-20.htm">Numbers 1:20</a>), would naturally be arranged by hundreds, fifties, etc. (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-9.htm">2 Kings 1:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-11.htm">2 Kings 1:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-13.htm">2 Kings 1:13</a>). In eleven tribes the number enrolled consists of complete hundreds. The difference, in this respect, observable in the case of the tribe of Gad here <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-25.htm">Numbers 1:25</a>, and of the tribe of Reuben at the later census <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-7.htm">Numbers 26:7</a>, is probably to be accounted for by the pastoral, and consequently nomadic, habits of these tribes, which rendered it difficult to bring all their members together at once for a census. Judah already takes precedence of his brethren in point of numbers (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8</a> note), and Ephraim of Manasseh (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19-20</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-44. These are those that were numbered&#8212;In this registration the tribe of Judah appears the most numerous; and accordingly, as the pre-eminence had been assigned to it by Jacob [Ge 49:8-12], it got the precedence in all the encampments of Israel. Of the two half-tribes of Joseph, who is seen to be "a fruitful bough" [Ge 49:22], that of Ephraim was the larger, as had been predicted. The relative increase of all, as in the two just mentioned, was owing to the special blessing of God, conformably to the prophetic declaration of the dying patriarch. But the divine blessing is usually conveyed through the influence of secondary causes; and there is reason to believe that the relative populousness of the tribes would, under God, depend upon the productiveness of the respective localities assigned to them.
