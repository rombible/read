Singular services shall be recompensed by singular honours. It was to the honour of the Levites, that to them was committed the care of the tabernacle and its treasures, in their camps and in their marches. It was for the honour of the holy things that none should see them, or touch them, but those who were called of God to the service. We all are unfit and unworthy to have fellowship with God, till called by his grace into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord; and so, being the spiritual seed of that great High Priest, we are made priests to our God. Great care must be taken to prevent sin, for preventing sin is preventing wrath. Being a holy tribe, they were not reckoned among other Israelites. They that minister about holy things, should neither entangle themselves, nor be entangled, in worldly affairs. And let every believer seek to do what the Lord has commanded.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>had spoken - Render spake.

But the Levites &#8230; were not numbered among them&#8212;They were obliged to keep a register of their own. They were consecrated to the priestly office, which in all countries has been exempted customarily, and in Israel by the express authority of God, from military service. The custody of the things devoted to the divine service was assigned to them so exclusively, that "no stranger"&#8212;that is, no person, not even an Israelite of any other tribe, was allowed, under penalty of death, to approach these [Nu 16:40]. Hence they encamped round the tabernacle in order that there should be no manifestation of the divine displeasure among the people. Thus the numbering of the people was subservient to the separation of the Levites from those Israelites who were fit for military service, and to the practical introduction of the law respecting the first-born, for whom the tribe of Levi became a substitute [Ex 13:2; Nu 3:12].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Because they were not generally to go out to war, which was the thing principally eyed in this muster, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-3.htm" title="From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: you and Aaron shall number them by their armies.">Numbers 1:3</a>,20,45</span> but were to attend upon the service or the tabernacle, and therefore are reserved to another distinct muster, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-15.htm" title="Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shall you number them.">Numbers 3:15</a> 4:2</span>, &c.
