It is said of each tribe, that those were numbered who were able to go forth to war; they had wars before them, though now they met with no opposition.

Beth aboth ("fathers' houses"), in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2</a>, is a technical expression for the subdivisions in which the mishpachoth, or families of the tribes, were arranged, and is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4</a> according to its original usage, based upon the natural division of the tribes into mishpachoth and families, to the fathers' houses which every tribe possessed in the family of its first-born. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5-15</a>, these heads of tribes were mentioned by name, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-12.htm">Numbers 7:12</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-14.htm">Numbers 10:14</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-16.htm">Numbers 1:16</a> they are designated as "called men of the congregation," because they were called to diets of the congregation, as representatives of the tribes, to regulate the affairs of the nation; also "princes of the tribes of their fathers," and "heads of the thousands of Israel:" "prince," from the nobility of their birth; and "heads," as chiefs of the alaphim composing the tribes. Alaphim is equivalent to mishpachoth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-4.htm">Numbers 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-14.htm">Joshua 22:14</a>); because the number of heads of families in the mishpachoth of a tribe might easily amount to a thousand (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>). In a similar manner, the term "hundred" in the old German came to be used in several different senses (see Grimm, deutsche Rechts-alterthmer, p. 532). </body></html>
