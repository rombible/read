Take the first scene. A prophet, who knows God and His will, is standing on the mountain top, and as he looks down over the valley beneath him, with its acacia-trees and swift river, there spread the tents of Israel. He sees them, and knows that they are ‘a people whom the Lord hath blessed.’ Brought there to curse, ‘he blesses them altogether’; and as he gazes upon their ordered ranks and sees somewhat of the wondrous future that lay before them, his mind is filled with the thought of all the blessedness of that righteous nation, and the sigh of longing comes to his lips, ‘May I be with them in life and death; may I have no higher honour, no calmer end, than to lie down and die as one of the chosen people, with memories of a divine hand that has protected me all through the past, and quiet hopes of the same hand holding me up in the great darkness!’ A devout aspiration, a worthy desire!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Look at the other picture. Midian has seduced Israel to idolatry and its constant companion, sensual sin. The old lawgiver has for his last achievement to punish the idolater. ‘Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites, afterwards thou shalt be gathered to thy people.’ So each tribe gives its contingent to the fight, and under the fierce and prompt Phinehas, whose javelin had already smitten one of the chief offenders, they go forth. Fire and sword, devastation and victory, mark their track. The princes of Midian fall before the swift rush of the desert-born invaders. And-sad, strange company!-among them is the ‘man who saw the vision of the Almighty, and knew the knowledge of the Most High’ ! he who had taught Moab the purest lessons of morality, and Midian, alas! the practice of the vilest profligacy; he who saw from afar ‘the sceptre arise out of Israel and the Star from Jacob’; he who longed to ‘die the death of the righteous’ ! The onset of the avenging host, with the ‘shout of a king’ in their midst; the terror of the flight, the riot of havoc and bloodshed, and, finally, the quick thrust of the sharp Israelite sword in some strong hand, and the grey hairs all dabbled with his blood-these were what the man came to who had once breathed the honest desire, ‘Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his’ !<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">I. There is surely a solemn lesson for us all here</span>-as touching the danger of mere vague religious desires and convictions which we do not allow to determine our conduct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Balaam had evidently much knowledge. Look at these points-<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">a</span>} His knowledge of the covenant-name of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">b</span>} His knowledge of a pure morality and a spiritual worship far beyond sacrificial notions, and in some respects higher than the then Old Testament standpoint.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">c</span>} The knowledge {which is implied in the text} of a future state, which had gone far into the background, even if it had not been altogether lost, among the Israelites. Is it not remarkable that the religious ideas of this man were in advance of Israel’s at this time; that there seems to have lingered among these ‘outsiders’ more of a pure faith than in Israel itself?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What a lesson here as to the souls led by God and enlightened by Him beyond the pale of Judaism!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But all this knowledge, of what use was it to Balaam? He knows about God: does he seek to serve Him? He preaches morality to Moab, and he teaches Midian to ‘teach the children of Israel to commit fornication.’ He knows something of the blessedness of a ‘righteous man’ s’ death, and perhaps sees faintly the shining gates beyond-but how does it all end? What a gulf between <span class="ital">knowledge</span> and <span class="ital">life</span>!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What is the use of correct ideas about God? They may be the foundations of holy thoughts, and they are meant to be so. I am not setting up emotion above principle, or fancying that there can be religion without theology; but for what are all our thoughts about God given us?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">a</span>} That they may influence our hearts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">b</span>} That they may subdue our wills.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">c</span>} That they may mould our practical life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If they do not do that-then <span class="ital">what</span> do they do?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They constitute a positive hindrance-like the dead lava-blocks that choke the mouth of a crater, or the two deposits on the bottom of a boiler, soot outside and crust inside, which keep the fire from getting at the water. They have lost their power because they are so familiar. They are weakened by not being practised. The very organs of intelligence are, as it were, ossified. Self-complacency lays hold on the possession of these ideas and shields itself against all appeals with the fact of possessing them. Many a man mistakes, in his own case, the knowledge of the truth for obedience to the truth. All this is seen in everyday life, and with reference to all manner of convictions, but it is most apparent and most fatal about Christian truth. I appeal to the many who hear and know all about ‘the word,’ What more is needed? That you should do what you know {‘Be not hearers only’}; that you should yield your whole being to Christ, the living Word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Balaam is an example of convictions which remain inefficacious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It was not without some sense of his own character, and some forebodings of what was possibly brooding over him, that he uttered these words of the text. But they were transitory emotions, and they passed away.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I suppose that every man who hears the gospel proclaimed is, at some time or other, conscious of dawning thoughts which, if followed, would lead him to decision for Christ. I suppose that every man among us is conscious of thoughts visiting him many a time when he least expects them, which, if honestly obeyed, would work an entire revolution in his life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I do not wish to speak as if unbelieving men were the only people who were unfaithful to their consciences, but rather to deal with what is a besetting sin of us all, though it reaches its highest aggravation in reference to the gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Such stings of conviction come to us all, but how are they deadened?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">a</span>} By simple neglect. Pay no attention to them; do not do anything in consequence, and they will gradually disappear. The voice unheard will cease to speak. Non-obedience to conscience will in the end almost throttle conscience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">b</span>} By angry rejection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">c</span>} By busy occupation with the outer world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{<span class="ital">d</span>} By sinful occupation with it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then consider that such dealing with our convictions leaves us far worse men than before, and if continued will end in utter insensibility.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What should we do with such convictions? Reverently follow them. And in so doing they will grow and increase, and lead us at last to God and peace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Special application of all this to our attitude towards Christian truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Balaam is an instance of wishes that are never fulfilled.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>He wished to die ‘as the righteous.’ How did he die? miserably; and why?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{1} Because his wish was deficient in character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It was <span class="ital">one</span> among a great many, feeble and not predominant, occasioned by circumstances, and so fading when these disappeared. Like many men’s relation to the gospel who would <span class="ital">like</span> to be Christians, and are not. These vagrant wishes are nothing; mere ‘catspaws’ of wind, not a breeze. They are not real, even while they last, and so they come to nothing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{2} Because it was partially wrong in its object.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He was willing to die the death, but not to live the life, of the righteous; like many men who would be very glad to ‘go to heaven when they die,’ but who will not be Christians while they live.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now, God forbid that I should say that his wish was wrong! But only it was not enough. Such a wish led to no action.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now, God hears the faintest wish; He does not require that we should will strongly, but He does require that we should desire, and that we should act according to our desires.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Let the close be a brief picture of a righteous death. And oh! if you feel that it is blessed, then let that desire lead you to Christ, and all will be well. Remember that Bunyan saw a byway to hell at the door of the celestial city. Remember how Balaam ended, and stands gibbeted in the New Testament as an evil man, and the type of false teachers. Finally, beware of knowledge which is not operative in conduct, of convictions which are neglected and pass away, of vague desires which come to nought.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-10.htm" title="Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!">Numbers 23:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who can count the dust of Jacob? — </span>Who can count a people which is like the dust of the earth for number? Thus was God’s promise to Abraham. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-16.htm" title="And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall your seed also be numbered.">Genesis 13:16</a>.) <span class="ital">I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, </span>already fulfilled. <span class="ital">The number of the fourth part of Israel — </span>Referring, probably, to the division of Israel into four camps, which lay now in his view, as if he had said, How vast is the number of this people, when even one of their camps is so numerous as to be almost past reckoning! <span class="ital">Of the righteous — </span>Of this righteous and holy people. The sense is, they are not only happy above other nations in this life, and therefore in vain should I curse them, but they have this peculiar privilege, that they are happy after death: their happiness begins where the happiness of other people ends; and therefore I heartily wish that my soul may have its portion with theirs when I die. Was not God now striving with him, not only for the sake of Israel, but of his own soul? And had he not probably some forebodings of his own coming to an untimely end, as he really did afterward, being slain with the five kings of Midian by the sword of Israel? Alas! what did this wish, however sincere and passionate, signify while he was pursuing his covetous and ambitious designs, and seeking the wages of unrighteousness? And what will a similar desire in any of us avail, unless we break off every known sin, by repentance toward God, and sincerely turn to him in heart and life, by a faith in Christ, which <span class="ital">worketh by love, </span>and is of the operation of his Spirit? That we may <span class="ital">die the death of the righteous, </span>we must live his life; and in order thereto must <span class="ital">win Christ, </span>as the apostle’s expression is, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-8.htm" title="Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,...">Php 3:8-9</a>,) <span class="ital">and be found in him, not having our own righteousness, but that which is through faith in Christ — </span>Being hereby both justified and regenerated, and made practically obedient to God’s holy law.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-10 With the camps of Israel full in view, Balaam ordered seven altars to be built, and a bullock and a ram to be offered on each. Oh the sottishness of superstition, to imagine that God will be at man's beck! The curse is turned into a blessing, by the overruling power of God, in love to Israel. God designed to serve his own glory by Balaam, and therefore met him. If God put a word into the mouth of Balaam, who would have defied God and Israel, surely he will not be wanting to those who desire to glorify God, and to edify his people; it shall be given what they should speak. He who opened the mouth of the ass, caused the mouth of this wicked man to speak words as contrary to the desire of his heart, as those of the ass were to the powers of the brute. The miracle was as great in the one case as in the other. Balaam pronounces Israel safe. He owns he could do no more than God suffered him to do. He pronounces them happy in their distinction from the rest of the nations. Happy in their numbers, which made them both honourable and formidable. Happy in their last end. Death is the end of all men; even the righteous must die, and it is good for us to think of this with regard to ourselves, as Balaam does here, speaking of his own death. He pronounces the righteous truly blessed, not only while they live, but when they die; which makes their death even more desirable than life itself. But there are many who desire to die the death of the righteous, but do not endeavour to live the life of the righteous; gladly would they have an end like theirs, but not a way like theirs. They would be saints in heaven, but not saints on earth. This saying of Balaam's is only a wish, not a prayer; it is a vain wish, being only a wish for the end, without any care for the means. Many seek to quiet their consciences with the promise of future amendment, or take up with some false hope, while they neglect the only way of salvation, by which a sinner can be righteous before God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The fourth part of Israel - i. e., each one of the four camps, into which the host of Israel was divided (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>), seemed to swarm with innumerable multitudes.

The meaning is: they are a people happy, above all others, not only in life, but at death, from their knowledge of the true God, and their hope through His grace.

Balaam had some notion of this; and though he did not care to live the life of such, he wished to die their death, or that he might be as happy at death as they; by which he bears a testimony to the immortality of the soul, to a future state after death, and to an eternal life and happiness to be enjoyed by good men: <p>and let my last end be like his; which is a phrase expressive of much the same thing as before: death is the end of a man in this world; and the end of a righteous man in it is peace, rest, salvation, and eternal life, or is what follows upon it, and he then enters into: some render it, "my reward" (b), which comes to much the same sense, the above being the righteous man's reward, not in a way of debt, but grace; others render the word, "my posterity" (c); but it is not certain Balaam had any, and if he had, his concern seems to be more for himself than for them. <p>(a) rectorum, Pagninus, Montanus, Piscator.

The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, apparently from an incorrect reading. The Samaritan and the older versions, followed by the Vulgate, render it "progeny,'" but this meaning is conjectural, and there seems no sufficient reason to depart from the common translation. <span class="cmt_word">Let me die the death</span>  <span class="cmt_word">of the righteous.</span> The word "righteous" is in the plural (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>): it may refer either to the Israelites as a holy nation, living and dying in the favour of God; or to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, the promises made to whom, in faith of which they died, were already so gloriously fulfilled. If the former reference was intended, Balaam must have had a much fuller and happier knowledge of "life and immortality" than the Israelites themselves, to whom death was dreadful, all the more that it ended a life protected and blessed by God (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/88-10.htm">Psalm 88:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>). It is hardly credible that so singular an anticipation of purely Christian feeling should really be found in the mouth of a prophet of that day, for it is clear that the words, however much inspired, did express the actual emotion of Balaam at the moment. It is therefore more consistent with the facts and probabilities of the case to suppose that Balaam referred to righteous Abraham (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>) and his immediate descendants, and wished that when he came to die he might have as sure a hope as they had enjoyed that God would bless and multiply their seed, and make their name to be glorious in the earth. <span class="cmt_word">Let my last end be like his.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> (last end) is the same word translated "latter days" and "latter end" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14, 20</a>. It means the last state of a people or of a man as represented in his offspring; the sense is not incorrectly expressed by the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And God came to meet Balaam," who thought it necessary, as a true hariolus, to call the attention of God to the altars which had been built for Him, and the sacrifices that had been offered upon them.
