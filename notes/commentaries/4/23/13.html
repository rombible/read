On the other hand, if that interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-41.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that there he might see the utmost part of the people.">Numbers 22:41</a> be adopted, which implies that from Bamoth-Baal Balaam had a view of the whole of the host of Israel from one extremity of their camps to the other, the meaning of this verse would be that although the sight of so vast and orderly a mass produced so powerful an effect upon Balaam that he was unable to utter the curses which he had desired to pronounce upon Israel, such an effect would not be equally likely to be produced if only a portion of the camps was visible at the same time.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:11-30 Balak was angry with Balaam. Thus a confession of God's overruling power is extorted from a wicked prophet, to the confusion of a wicked prince. A second time the curse is turned into a blessing; and this blessing is both larger and stronger than the former. Men change their minds, and break their words; but God never changes his mind, and therefore never recalls his promise. And when in Scripture he is said to repent, it does not mean any change of his mind; but only a change of his way. There was sin in Jacob, and God saw it; but there was not such as might provoke him to give them up to ruin. If the Lord sees that we trust in his mercy, and accept of his salvation; that we indulge no secret lust, and continue not in rebellion, but endeavour to serve and glorify him; we may be sure that he looks upon us as accepted in Christ, that our sins are all pardoned. Oh the wonders of providence and grace, the wonders of redeeming love, of pardoning mercy, of the new-creating Spirit! Balak had no hope of ruining Israel, and Balaam showed that he had more reason to fear being ruined by them. Since Balaam cannot say what he would have him, Balak wished him to say nothing. But though there are many devices in man's heart, God's counsels shall stand. Yet they resolve to make another attempt, though they had no promise on which to build their hopes. Let us, who have a promise that the vision at the end shall speak and not lie, continue earnest in prayer, Lu 18:1.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Balak seems to hope that the prophet's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-10.htm">Numbers 23:10</a> reflected the impression conveyed by the scene before him at the moment of the augury; and so that the sight of a mere few straggling Israelites in the utmost part of the camp might induce a different estimate of their resources and prospects. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-15.

If the words are genuine, they may perhaps mean that Balaam would be taken to a spot whence he would still be able to see only a small part of them, but if that failed, he could finally go to a place whence he could see them all. But many writers assign the words to an editor.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come... unto another place.</span> Balak attributed the miscarriage of his enterprise thus far to something inauspicious in the locality.

Both the meaning of the nouns and the tense of the verb are disputed.

On the other hand, some would read the verb in the present tense, and understand Balak's words to refer to the place they were leaving. This is in accordance with the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>, and it would certainly seem as if Balak and Balaam moved each time nearer to that encampment which was for different masons the center of attraction to them both. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Balaam's first saying. - Having come back to the burnt-offering, Balaam commenced his utterance before the king and the assembled princes. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, lit., a simile, then a proverb, because the latter consists of comparisons and figures, and lastly a sentence or saying. The application of this term to the announcements made by Balaam (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-18.htm">Numbers 23:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-20.htm">Numbers 24:20</a>), whereas it is never used of the prophecies of the true prophets of Jehovah, but only of certain songs and similes inserted in them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>), is to be accounted for not merely from the poetic form of Balaam's utterances, the predominance of poetical imagery, the sustained parallelism, the construction of the whole discourse in brief pointed sentences, and other peculiarities of poetic language (e.g., &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15</a>), but it points at the same time to the difference which actually exists between these utterances and the predictions of the true prophets. The latter are orations addressed to the congregation, which deduce from the general and peculiar relation of Israel to the Lord and to His law, the conduct of the Lord towards His people either in their own or in future times, proclaiming judgment upon the ungodly and salvation to the righteous. "Balaam's mental eye," on the contrary, as Hengstenberg correctly observes, "was simply fixed upon what he saw; and this he reproduced without any regard to the impression that it was intended to make upon those who heard it." But the very first utterance was of such a character as to deprive Balak of all hope that his wishes would be fulfilled.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a><p>"Balak, the king of Moab, fetches me from Aram, from the mountains of the East," i.e., of Mesopotamia, which was described, as far back as <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a>, as the land of the sons of the East (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-5.htm">Numbers 22:5</a>). Balaam mentions the mountains of his home in contradistinction to the mountains of the land of the Moabites upon which he was then standing. "Come, curse me Jacob, and come threaten Israel." Balak had sent for him for this purpose (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-11.htm">Numbers 22:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-17.htm">Numbers 22:17</a>). &#1494;&#1506;&#1502;&#1492;, for &#1494;&#1506;&#1502;&#1492;, imperative (see Ewald, 228, b.). &#1494;&#1506;&#1501;, to be angry, here to give utterance to the wrath of God, synonymous with &#1504;&#1511;&#1489; or &#1511;&#1489;&#1489;, to curse.
