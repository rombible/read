A plurality of altars was the badge of idolatry. Hengsten-berg adduces several instances in proof that the ancients were accustomed to have recourse to sacrifice and conjuration in order to avert calamity and produce prosperity. (<span class= "ital">History of Balaam and his Prophecies, </span>p. 392.) The number <span class= "ital">seven </span>was regarded as significant among the Greeks and Romans, as well as among the Israelites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-1.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.">Numbers 23:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Build me seven altars — </span>To the true God, otherwise he would not have mentioned it to God as an argument why he should grant his requests, as he does, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-4.htm" title="And God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.">Numbers 23:4</a>.

The principal events that should befall the world and the church, from the time of the banishment of St. John to the isle of Patmos, in the reign of Domitian, (A.D. 96,) to the consummation of all things, are comprehended in that wonderful book of prophecy termed the Revelation, by St. John, under the emblems of <span class="ital">seven seals </span>of a book opened, <span class="ital">seven trumpets </span>sounded by <span class="ital">seven angels, </span>and <span class="ital">seven vials </span>poured out also by <span class="ital">seven angels. </span>Now what more solid reason can be assigned for this peculiar regard shown by God himself to the number <span class="ital">seven, </span>than that it was intended to hold him forth to mankind as that Jehovah who had created the world in six days, and by resting on the seventh, had consecrated that number, and rendered it in some sense sacred to all nations and ages?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-10 With the camps of Israel full in view, Balaam ordered seven altars to be built, and a bullock and a ram to be offered on each. Oh the sottishness of superstition, to imagine that God will be at man's beck! The curse is turned into a blessing, by the overruling power of God, in love to Israel. God designed to serve his own glory by Balaam, and therefore met him. If God put a word into the mouth of Balaam, who would have defied God and Israel, surely he will not be wanting to those who desire to glorify God, and to edify his people; it shall be given what they should speak. He who opened the mouth of the ass, caused the mouth of this wicked man to speak words as contrary to the desire of his heart, as those of the ass were to the powers of the brute. The miracle was as great in the one case as in the other. Balaam pronounces Israel safe. He owns he could do no more than God suffered him to do. He pronounces them happy in their distinction from the rest of the nations. Happy in their numbers, which made them both honourable and formidable. Happy in their last end. Death is the end of all men; even the righteous must die, and it is good for us to think of this with regard to ourselves, as Balaam does here, speaking of his own death. He pronounces the righteous truly blessed, not only while they live, but when they die; which makes their death even more desirable than life itself. But there are many who desire to die the death of the righteous, but do not endeavour to live the life of the righteous; gladly would they have an end like theirs, but not a way like theirs. They would be saints in heaven, but not saints on earth. This saying of Balaam's is only a wish, not a prayer; it is a vain wish, being only a wish for the end, without any care for the means. Many seek to quiet their consciences with the promise of future amendment, or take up with some false hope, while they neglect the only way of salvation, by which a sinner can be righteous before God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Balaam, after the general custom of the pagan, prefaced his divinations by sacrifice. In the number of the altars regard was probably had to the number of the then known planets. Yet Balaam evidently intended his sacrifice as an offering to the true God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 23<p>Nu 23:1-30. Balak's Sacrifices.<p>1. Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars&#8212;Balak, being a heathen, would naturally suppose these altars were erected in honor of Baal, the patron deity of his country. It is evident, from Nu 23:4 that they were prepared for the worship of the true God; although in choosing the high places of Baal as their site and rearing a number of altars (2Ki 18:22; Isa 17:8; Jer 11:13; Ho 8:11; 10:1), instead of one only, as God had appointed, Balaam blended his own superstitions with the divine worship. The heathen, both in ancient and modern times, attached a mysterious virtue to the number seven; and Balaam, in ordering the preparation of so many altars, designed to mystify and delude the king.Balak and Balsam sacrifice: God meets him, and he blesses Israel, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/23-1.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams....">Numbers 23:1-10</a></span>.

And though Balak was averse from God and his worship, yet he would be easily overruled by Balaam, who doubtless told him that it was in vain to make an address to any other than the God of Israel, who alone was able either to bless or curse them, as he pleased.

But though he direct his sacrifices to the right object, he chooseth a wrong place, and, to comply with Balak’s desire, makes use of the high places of Baal for this end, and mingles his own superstitions with the worship of God, in erecting divers altars, according to the manner of heathens and idolators, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-22.htm" title="But if you say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem?">2 Kings 18:22</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-8.htm" title="And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.">Isaiah 17:8</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-13.htm" title="For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.">Jeremiah 11:13</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-11.htm" title="Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, altars shall be to him to sin.">Hosea 8:11</a> 10:1 12:11</span>; whereas God appointed and holy men used but one altar, though many sacrifices were to be offered upon it, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-20.htm" title="And Noah built an altar to the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.">Genesis 8:20</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-15.htm" title="And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:">Exodus 17:15</a> 24:4</span>.

When upon one of the high places of Baal, and after having taken a view of the people of Israel as they lay encamped: <p>build me here seven altars; this was purely Heathenish; for not only the Israelites after the law of Moses had but one altar, but the patriarchs before that never built but one altar at a time. Some have thought regard is had to the seven planets worshipped by Heathens; though no doubt Balaam pretended to sacrifice to Jehovah the true God, in order to gain him over to him to agree to it to curse Israel, and persuaded Balak, though an idolater, to join with him; and, the more easily to bring him to it, mixes Heathen rites and customs in sacrifice to him: <p>and prepare me here seven oxen, and seven rams; which were creatures offered in sacrifice according to the law of Moses, and before that was given, and by persons who were not under it; and even by seven of each sort, and that by the express command of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>. It may be observed, that both in this, and the preceding clause, the word here is carefully expressed, namely, in one of the high places; there the altars were erected, and thither the oxen were brought to be sacrificed; so that both the place, and the number of the altars, savoured of Heathenish worship, in which he complied to induce the king to sacrifice to Jehovah. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1–6</span><span class="ital">.</span> Balaam demanded a seven-fold sacrifice, in order to propitiate God, that He might be willing to give His prophet a message.

The number seven was especially connected with the revelation of the tree God, the Creator of the world, and was probably observed here for this reason. The sacrifices were offered no doubt to Jehovah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Reception of Balaam by the King of the Moabites. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-36.htm">Numbers 22:36</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-37.htm">Numbers 22:37</a>. As soon as Balak heard of Balaam's coming, he went to meet him at a city on the border of the Arnon, which flowed at the extreme (north) boundary (of the Moabitish territory), viz., at Areopolis (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-15.htm">Numbers 21:15</a>), probably the capital of the kingdom at one time, but now reduced to a frontier town, since Sihon the Amorite had taken all the land as far as the Arnon; whilst Rabbah, which was farther south, had been selected as the residence of the king. By coming as far as the frontier of his kingdom to meet the celebrated soothsayer, Balak intended to do him special honour. But he would not help receiving him with a gentle reproof for not having come at his first invitation, as if he, the king, had not been in a condition to honour him according to his merits. </body></html>
