The enemies of God's church often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og, king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours, to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in like manner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain, when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success, while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of the glorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, in comparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest of great things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We must make no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat with them; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting in God, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In these apparently unimportant words is contained the record of the Israelite <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-39.htm">Numbers 32:39</a> occupation of Gilead north of the Jabbok; a territory which, though populated, like southern Gilead, by the Amorites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10</a>, etc.), formed part of the domain of Og king of Bashan, who was himself of a different race <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-2.htm">Deuteronomy 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-11.htm">Joshua 13:11</a>.

On the phrase, "beyond the Jordan" ("Peraea"), which is used indifferently of both sides, the one by a conventional, the other by a natural, use, see on Deuteronomy 1:1.

Thou art lost, people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity-To Sihon, king of the Amorites." The poet here turns to Moab, and announces its overthrow. Chemosh (&#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;, from &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, subactor, domitor) was the leading deity of the Moabites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>) as well as of the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>), and related not only to Milcom, a god of the Ammonites, but also to the early Canaanitish deity Baal and Moloch. According to a statement of Jerome (on <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1-9</a>), it was only another name for Baal Peor, probably a god of the sun, which was worshipped as the king of his nation and the god of war. He is found in this character upon the coins of Areopolis, standing upon a column, with a sword in his right hand and a lance and shield in the left, and with two fire-torches by his side (cf. Ekhel doctr. numm. vet. iii. p. 504), and was appeased by the sacrifice of children in times of great distress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>). Further information, and to some extent a different view, are found in the article by J. G. Mller in Herzog's Cyclopaedia. The subject to &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; is neither Moab nor Jehovah, but Chemosh. The thought is this: as Chemosh, the god of Moab, could not deliver his people from the Amorite king; so now that Israel has conquered the latter, Moab is utterly lost. In the triumph which Israel celebrated over Moab through conquering its conquerors, there is a forewarning expressed of the ultimate subjection of Moab under the sceptre of Israel.</body></html>
