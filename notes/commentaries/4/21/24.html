The enemies of God's church often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og, king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours, to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in like manner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain, when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success, while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of the glorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, in comparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest of great things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We must make no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat with them; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting in God, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jabbok (now Wady Zerka: compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22</a>) runs eastward under Rabbah of the children of Ammon, thence westward, and reaches the Jordan, 45 miles north of the Arnon.

The Jabbok flows into the Jordan nearly 25 miles north of the Dead Sea. The district here described is now known as the <span class="ital">Belka‘</span> (see G. A. Smith, <span class="ital">H. G.

The natural features of the country would afford no special obstacle, but the border fortresses might be impregnable. The Heb. adjective, however, is peculiar; <span class="ital">‘az</span> (<span class="greekheb">עַז</span>) usually denotes ‘fierce,’ ‘cruel,’ rather than strong. The LXX. read the word as ‘Jazer,’ a town mentioned in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-32.htm" title="And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.">Numbers 21:32</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm" title="Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,">Numbers 32:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-35.htm" title="And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,">Numbers 32:35</a>; and it is possible that ‘for strong (<span class="greekheb">כי עז</span>) was the border, &c.’ should be emended to ‘at Jazer (<span class="greekheb">ביעזר</span>) was the border, &c.’ a statement which finds a parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm" title="And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that is before Rabbah;">Joshua 13:25</a>.

It was, therefore, a critical moment in their history when they met the forces of Sihon, confident from their recent victory over Moab. We may suppose that Joshua was their military leader now, as before and after. From Arnon unto Jabbok. The Jabbok, which formed the boundary of Sihon on the north towards the kingdom of Og, and on the east towards the Ammonites, is the modern Zerka: it runs in a large curve northeast, north-west, and west, until it fails into Jordan, forty-five miles north of the mouth of the Arnon. <span class="cmt_word">Even</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</span> This is perhaps intended to explain rather why the Amorites had not extended their conquests any further, than why the Israelites made no attempt to cross the border of Ammon; they had another and more sufficient reason (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>). Rabbah of Ammon, which stood upon the right (here the eastern) bank of the Upper Jabbok, was an extremely strong place which effectually protected the country behind it, even until the reign of David (see on 2 Samuel 11, 12). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>They proceeded thence to Beer (a well), a place of encampment which received its name from the fact that here God gave the people water, not as before by a miraculous supply from a rock, but by commanding wells to be dug. This is evident from the ode with which the congregation commemorated this divine gift of grace. "Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well! Sing ye to it! Well which princes dug, which the nobles of the people hollowed out, with the sceptre, with their staves." &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-18.htm">Exodus 32:18</a>. &#1502;&#1495;&#1511;&#1511;, ruler's staff, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. Beer, probably the same as Beer Elim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-8.htm">Isaiah 15:8</a>), on the north-east of Moab, was in the desert; for the Israelites proceeded thence "from the desert to Mattanah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-18.htm">Numbers 21:18</a>), thence to Nahaliel, and thence to Bamoth. According to Eusebius (cf. Reland, Pal. ill. p. 495), Mattanah (&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;) was by the valley of the Arnon, twelve Roman miles to the east (or more properly south-east or south) of Medabah, and is probably to be seen in Tedun, a place now lying in ruins, near the source of the Lejum (Burckhardt, pp. 635, 636; Hengstenberg, Balaam, p. 530; Knobel, and others). The name of Nahaliel is still retained in the form Encheileh. This is the name given to the Lejum, after it has been joined by the Balua, until its junction with the Saide (Burckhardt, p. 635). Consequently the Israelites went from Beer in the desert, in a north-westerly direction to Tedun, then westwards to the northern bank of the Encheileh, and then still farther in a north-westerly and northerly direction to Bamoth. There can be no doubt that Bamoth is identical with Bamoth Baal, i.e., heights of Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4</a>). According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>), Bamoth was near to Dibon (Dibn), between the Wady Wale and Wady Mojeb, and also to Beth-Baal Meon, i.e., Myun, half a German mile (2 1/2 English) to the south of Heshbon; and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>, you could see Bamoth Baal from the extremity of the Israelitish camp in the steppes of Moab. Consequently Bamoth cannot be the mountain to the south of Wady Wale, upon the top of which Burckhardt says there is a very beautiful plain (p. 632; see Hengstenberg, Balaam, p. 532); because the steppes of Moab cannot be seen at all from this plain, as they are covered by the Jebel Attarus. It is rather a height upon the long mountain Attarus, which runs along the southern shore of the Zerka Maein, and may possibly be a spot upon the summit of the Jebel Attarus, "the highest point in the neighbourhood," upon which, according to Burckhardt (p. 630), there is "a heap of stones overshadowed by a very large pistachio-tree." A little farther down to the south-west of this lies the fallen town Kereijat (called Krriat by Seetzen, ii. p. 342), i.e., Kerioth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>.</body></html>
