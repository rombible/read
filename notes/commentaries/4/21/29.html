The enemies of God's church often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og, king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours, to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in like manner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain, when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success, while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of the glorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, in comparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest of great things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We must make no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat with them; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting in God, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Chemosh - The national God of the Moabites (compare the marginal references). The name probably means "Vanquisher," or "Master." The worship of Chemosh was introduced into Israel by Solomon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>. It was no doubt to Chemosh that Mesha, king of Moab, offered up his son as a burnt-offering <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-26.htm">2 Kings 3:26-27</a>.<p>In the first six lines <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-27.htm">Numbers 21:27-28</a> the poet imagines for the Amorites a song of exultation for their victories over Moab, and for the consequent glories of Heshbon, their own capital. In the next lines <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm">Numbers 21:29</a> he himself joins in this strain; which now becomes one of half-real, half-ironical compassion for the Moabites, whom their idol Chemosh was unable to save. But in the last lines <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a> a startling change takes place; the new and decisive triumph of the poet's own countrymen is abruptly introduced; and the boastings of the Arnorites fade utterly away. Of the towns Heshbon was the northernmost, and therefore, to the advancing Israelites, the last to be reached. Medeba, now Madeba, was four miles south of Heshbon (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-15.htm">1 Chronicles 19:15</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. people of Chemosh&#8212;the name of the Moabite idol (1Ki 11:7-33; 2Ki 23:13; Jer 48:46).<p>he&#8212;that is, their god, hath surrendered his worshippers to the victorious arms of Sihon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Alas, poor Moab! thou couldst not save thyself from Sihon’s sword. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">People of Chemosh, </span> i.e. the worshippers of Chemosh: so the god of the Moabites was called, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1 Kings 11:7</a>,33 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm" title="And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.">2 Kings 23:13</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-46.htm" title="Woe be to you, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perishes: for your sons are taken captives, and your daughters captives.">Jeremiah 48:46</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He, </span> i.e. their god, hath delivered up his own people to his and their enemies; he could not defend them, but suffered many of them to be killed; nor could be secure even those that had escaped the sword, but suffered them to fall into their enemies’ hands, and by them to be carried into captivity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</span> Now the words of this and the following verse seem to be not a part of that triumphant song or poem made, as I suppose, by some Amoritish bard or poet, which seems to be concluded, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-28.htm" title="For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.">Numbers 21:28</a></span>; but of the Israelites making their observation upon it.

Chemosh was the national god of the Moabites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>), and also to some extent of the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>). It is generally agreed that the name is derived from the root <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5e9;</span>, to subdue, and thus will have substantially the same meaning as Milcom, Molech, and Baal; indeed it appears probable that there was a strong family likeness among the idolatries of Palestine, and that the various names represented different attributes of one supreme being rather than different divinities. Thus Baal and Ashtaroth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>) represented for the Zidonians the masculine and feminine elements respectively in the Divine energy. Baal himself was plural (Baalim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-18.htm">1 Kings 18:18</a>) in form, and either male or female (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>). In the inscription on the Moabite stone a god "Ashtar-Chemosh" is mentioned, and thus Chemosh is identified with the male deity of Phoenicia (Ashtar being the masculine form of Ashtoreth), while, on the other hand, it was almost certainly the same divinity who was worshipped under another name, and with other rites, as Baal-Peor (see on Numbers 25:3). On the coins of Areopolis Chemosh appears as a god of war armed, with fire-torches by his side. Human sacrifices were offered to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-26.htm">2 Kings 3:26, 27</a>), as to Baal and to Moloch. He hath given his sons, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Chemosh, who could not save his own votaries, nor the children of his people.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Defeat of the Amorite Kings, Sihon of Heshbon and Og of Bashan, and Conquest of their Kingdoms.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-23</a><p>When the Israelites reached the eastern border of the kingdom of the Amorite king Sihon (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>), they sent messengers to him, as they had previously done to the king of Edom, to ask permission to pass peaceably through his territory upon the high road (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-22.htm">Numbers 21:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-17.htm">Numbers 20:17</a>); and Sihon refused this request, just as the king of Edom had done, and marched with all his people against the Israelites. But whereas the Lord forbade the Israelites to make war upon their kinsmen the Edomites, He now commanded them to make war upon the Amorite king, and take possession of his land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24-25</a>); for the Amorites belonged to the Canaanitish tribes which were ripe for the judgment of extermination (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). And if, notwithstanding this, the Israelites sent to him with words of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-26.htm">Deuteronomy 2:26</a>), this was simply done to leave the decision of his fate in his own hand (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>). Sihon came out against the Israelites into the desert as far as Jahza, where a battle was fought, in which he was defeated. The accounts of the Onom. concerning Jahza, which was situated, according to Eusebius, between Medamon (Medaba) and Debous (Dibon, see above), and according to Jerome, between Medaba and Deblatai, may be reconciled with the statement that it was in the desert, provided we assume that it was not in a straight line between the places named, but in a more easterly direction on the edge of the desert, near to the commencement of the Wady Wale, a conclusion to which the juxtaposition of Jahza and Mephaot in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/21-37.htm">Joshua 21:37</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-21.htm">Jeremiah 48:21</a>, also points (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-18.htm">Joshua 13:18</a>).</body></html>
