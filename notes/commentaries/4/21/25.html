The enemies of God's church often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og, king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours, to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in like manner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain, when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success, while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of the glorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, in comparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest of great things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We must make no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat with them; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting in God, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Heshbon - Now Heshban, a ruined city, due east of the point where the Jordan enters the Dead Sea; conspicuous from all parts of the high plateau on which it stands, but concealed, like the rest of the plateau, from the valley beneath. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

But the natives whom the Israelites found in and around Palestine on their arrival were by no means homogeneous, and various names, such as Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites and others, frequently appear. The name ‘Amorite’ is sometimes used for the native inhabitants generally: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm" title="But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm" title="Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.">Genesis 48:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-15.htm" title="And if it seem evil to you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.">Joshua 24:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-9.htm" title="Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.">Amos 2:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-26.htm" title="And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.">1 Kings 21:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-11.htm" title="Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols:">2 Kings 21:11</a>. But sometimes it denotes natives in particular localities; e.g. in Canaan west of the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.">Joshua 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-7.htm" title="And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, why have you at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelled on the other side Jordan!">Joshua 7:7</a>); in the district afterwards occupied by Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-5.htm" title="Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.">Joshua 10:5</a> f., 12, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-34.htm" title="And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:...">Jdg 1:34-36</a>); in the Negeb and to the south and east of the Dead Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm" title="And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelled in Hazezontamar.">Genesis 14:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-7.htm" title="Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and to all the places near thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and to Lebanon, to the great river, the river Euphrates.">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm" title="And the Amorites, which dwelled in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah.">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>). Most frequently, however, it denotes the inhabitants of the district east of the Jordan, under the rule of Sihon and Og. Whether they were the original inhabitants who had been driven out by Moab and Ammon, but had regained their footing under the leadership of these two kings, or whether they had only first gained their territory by driving out Moab and Ammon, we do not know.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Heshbon</span>] The modern <span class="ital">Ḥesbân</span>, standing some 2940 feet above the sea, about 18 miles from the Jordan, opposite to Jericho.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all the towns thereof</span>] R.V. marg. ‘daughters’ is the literal meaning of the Heb.

It was not permanently occupied until a somewhat later period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33</a>); but we may suppose that the flocks and herds, with sufficient forces to guard them, spread themselves at once over the broad pasture lands. Heshbon, and all the villages, thereof. Literally, "the daughters thereof. By a similar figure we speak of a "mother city." Heshbon occupied a central position in the kingdom of Sihon, half way between Arnon and Jabbok, and about eighteen miles eastward of the point where Jordan falls into the Salt Lake; it stood on a table-land nearly 3000 feet above the sea, and had been made his city (i.e. his capital) by Sihon at the time of his victories over Moab. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>They proceeded thence to Beer (a well), a place of encampment which received its name from the fact that here God gave the people water, not as before by a miraculous supply from a rock, but by commanding wells to be dug. This is evident from the ode with which the congregation commemorated this divine gift of grace. "Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well! Sing ye to it! Well which princes dug, which the nobles of the people hollowed out, with the sceptre, with their staves." &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-18.htm">Exodus 32:18</a>. &#1502;&#1495;&#1511;&#1511;, ruler's staff, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. Beer, probably the same as Beer Elim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-8.htm">Isaiah 15:8</a>), on the north-east of Moab, was in the desert; for the Israelites proceeded thence "from the desert to Mattanah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-18.htm">Numbers 21:18</a>), thence to Nahaliel, and thence to Bamoth. According to Eusebius (cf. Reland, Pal. ill. p. 495), Mattanah (&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;) was by the valley of the Arnon, twelve Roman miles to the east (or more properly south-east or south) of Medabah, and is probably to be seen in Tedun, a place now lying in ruins, near the source of the Lejum (Burckhardt, pp. 635, 636; Hengstenberg, Balaam, p. 530; Knobel, and others). The name of Nahaliel is still retained in the form Encheileh. This is the name given to the Lejum, after it has been joined by the Balua, until its junction with the Saide (Burckhardt, p. 635). Consequently the Israelites went from Beer in the desert, in a north-westerly direction to Tedun, then westwards to the northern bank of the Encheileh, and then still farther in a north-westerly and northerly direction to Bamoth. There can be no doubt that Bamoth is identical with Bamoth Baal, i.e., heights of Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4</a>). According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>), Bamoth was near to Dibon (Dibn), between the Wady Wale and Wady Mojeb, and also to Beth-Baal Meon, i.e., Myun, half a German mile (2 1/2 English) to the south of Heshbon; and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>, you could see Bamoth Baal from the extremity of the Israelitish camp in the steppes of Moab. Consequently Bamoth cannot be the mountain to the south of Wady Wale, upon the top of which Burckhardt says there is a very beautiful plain (p. 632; see Hengstenberg, Balaam, p. 532); because the steppes of Moab cannot be seen at all from this plain, as they are covered by the Jebel Attarus. It is rather a height upon the long mountain Attarus, which runs along the southern shore of the Zerka Maein, and may possibly be a spot upon the summit of the Jebel Attarus, "the highest point in the neighbourhood," upon which, according to Burckhardt (p. 630), there is "a heap of stones overshadowed by a very large pistachio-tree." A little farther down to the south-west of this lies the fallen town Kereijat (called Krriat by Seetzen, ii. p. 342), i.e., Kerioth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>.</body></html>
