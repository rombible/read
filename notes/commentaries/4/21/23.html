The enemies of God's church often perish by the counsels they think most wisely taken. Og, king of Bashan, instead of being warned by the fate of his neighbours, to make peace with Israel, makes war with them, which proves in like manner his destruction. Wicked men do their utmost to secure themselves and their possessions against the judgments of God; but all in vain, when the day comes on which they must fall. God gave Israel success, while Moses was with them, that he might see the beginning of the glorious work, though he must not live to see it finished. This was, in comparison, but as the day of small things, yet it was an earnest of great things. We must prepare for fresh conflicts and enemies. We must make no peace or truce with the powers of darkness, nor even treat with them; nor should we expect any pause in our contest. But, trusting in God, and obeying his commands, we shall be more than conquerors over every enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the country of Moab - Rather, in the field of Moab: the upland pastures, or flat downs, intersected by the ravine of Wady Waleh.<p>Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon - Or, "toward the waste." See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-47.htm">Numbers 33:47</a>. Pisgah was a ridge of the Abarim mountains, westward from Heshbon. From the summit the Israelites gained their first view of the wastes of the Dead Sea and of the valley of the Jordan: and Moses again ascended it, to view, before his death, the land of promise. The interest attaching to the spot, and the need of a convenient name for it, has led Christians often to designate it as "Nebo," rather than as "the mountain of, or near to, Nebo;" but the latter is the more correct: Nebo denoted the town <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a> on the western slope of the ridge. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21-23.

This is evident from the ode with which the congregation commemorated this divine gift of grace. "Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well! Sing ye to it! Well which princes dug, which the nobles of the people hollowed out, with the sceptre, with their staves." &#1506;&#1504;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-18.htm">Exodus 32:18</a>. &#1502;&#1495;&#1511;&#1511;, ruler's staff, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>. Beer, probably the same as Beer Elim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-8.htm">Isaiah 15:8</a>), on the north-east of Moab, was in the desert; for the Israelites proceeded thence "from the desert to Mattanah" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-18.htm">Numbers 21:18</a>), thence to Nahaliel, and thence to Bamoth. According to Eusebius (cf. Reland, Pal. ill. p. 495), Mattanah (&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bc;) was by the valley of the Arnon, twelve Roman miles to the east (or more properly south-east or south) of Medabah, and is probably to be seen in Tedun, a place now lying in ruins, near the source of the Lejum (Burckhardt, pp. 635, 636; Hengstenberg, Balaam, p. 530; Knobel, and others). The name of Nahaliel is still retained in the form Encheileh. This is the name given to the Lejum, after it has been joined by the Balua, until its junction with the Saide (Burckhardt, p. 635). Consequently the Israelites went from Beer in the desert, in a north-westerly direction to Tedun, then westwards to the northern bank of the Encheileh, and then still farther in a north-westerly and northerly direction to Bamoth. There can be no doubt that Bamoth is identical with Bamoth Baal, i.e., heights of Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4</a>). According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>), Bamoth was near to Dibon (Dibn), between the Wady Wale and Wady Mojeb, and also to Beth-Baal Meon, i.e., Myun, half a German mile (2 1/2 English) to the south of Heshbon; and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>, you could see Bamoth Baal from the extremity of the Israelitish camp in the steppes of Moab. Consequently Bamoth cannot be the mountain to the south of Wady Wale, upon the top of which Burckhardt says there is a very beautiful plain (p. 632; see Hengstenberg, Balaam, p. 532); because the steppes of Moab cannot be seen at all from this plain, as they are covered by the Jebel Attarus. It is rather a height upon the long mountain Attarus, which runs along the southern shore of the Zerka Maein, and may possibly be a spot upon the summit of the Jebel Attarus, "the highest point in the neighbourhood," upon which, according to Burckhardt (p. 630), there is "a heap of stones overshadowed by a very large pistachio-tree." A little farther down to the south-west of this lies the fallen town Kereijat (called Krriat by Seetzen, ii. p. 342), i.e., Kerioth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-24.htm">Jeremiah 48:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>.</body></html>
