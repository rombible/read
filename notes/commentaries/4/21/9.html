Christ Jesus, “in the likeness of sinful flesh” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a>), was made sin for us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2Corinthians 5:21</a>), and thus fulfilled, as He Himself explained to Nicodemus, the type of the brazen serpent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-14.htm" title="And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:">John 3:14-15</a>). The meaning of this type, or “sign of salvation,” is explained in the Book of Wisdom in these words, “He that turned himself toward it was not saved by the thing that he saw, but by Thee, that art the Saviour of all” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-7.htm" title="And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD does choose, he shall be holy: you take too much on you, you sons of Levi.">Numbers 16:7</a>). This serpent was preserved by the Israelites, and taken into Canaan, and was ultimately destroyed by King Hezekiah, after it had become an object of idolatrous worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-4.htm" title="He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.">2Kings 18:4</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:4-9 The children of Israel were wearied by a long march round the land of Edom. They speak discontentedly of what God had done for them, and distrustfully of what he would do. What will they be pleased with, whom manna will not please? Let not the contempt which some cast on the word of God, make us value it less. It is the bread of life, substantial bread, and will nourish those who by faith feed upon it, to eternal life, whoever may call it light bread. We see the righteous judgment God brought upon them for murmuring. He sent fiery serpents among them, which bit or stung many to death. It is to be feared that they would not have owned the sin, if they had not felt the smart; but they relent under the rod. And God made a wonderful provision for their relief. The Jews themselves say it was not the sight of the brazen serpent that cured; but in looking up to it, they looked up to God as the Lord that healed them. There was much gospel in this. Our Saviour declared, Joh 3:14,15, that as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of man must be lifted up, that whatsoever believeth in him, should not perish. Compare their disease and ours. Sin bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder. Compare the application of their remedy and ours. They looked and lived, and we, if we believe, shall not perish. It is by faith that we look unto Jesus, Heb 12:2. Whosoever looked, however desperate his case, or feeble his sight, or distant his place, was certainly and perfectly cured. The Lord can relieve us from dangers and distresses, by means which human reason never would have devised. Oh that the venom of the old serpent, inflaming men's passions, and causing them to commit sins which end in their eternal destruction, were as sensibly felt, and the danger as plainly seen, as the Israelites felt pain from the bite of the fiery serpents, and feared the death which followed! Then none would shut their eyes to Christ, or turn from his gospel. Then a crucified Saviour would be so valued, that all things else would be accounted loss for him; then, without delay, and with earnestness and simplicity, all would apply to him in the appointed way, crying, Lord, save us; we perish! Nor would any abuse the freeness of Christ's salvation, while they reckoned the price which it cost him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make thee a fiery serpent - i. e. a serpent resembling in appearance the reptiles which attacked the people. The resemblance was of the essence of the symbolism (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-5.htm">1 Samuel 6:5</a>). As the brass serpent represented the instrument of their chastisement, so the looking unto it at God's word denoted acknowledgment of their sin, longing for deliverance from its penalty, and faith in the means appointed by God for healing. In the serpent of brass, harmless itself, but made in the image of the creature that is accursed above others <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Genesis 3:14</a>, the Christian fathers rightly see a figure of Him <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14-15</a> who though "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners" <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>, was yet "made sin" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>, and "made a curse for us" <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>. And the eye of faith fixed on Him beholds the manifestation at once of the deserts of sin, of its punishment imminent and deprecated, and of the method of its remission devised by God Himself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7-9. the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned&#8212;The severity of the scourge and the appalling extent of mortality brought them to a sense of sin, and through the intercessions of Moses, which they implored, they were miraculously healed. He was directed to make the figure of a serpent in brass, to be elevated on a pole or standard, that it might be seen at the extremities of the camp and that every bitten Israelite who looked to it might be healed. This peculiar method of cure was designed, in the first instance, to show that it was the efficacy of God's power and grace, not the effect of nature or art, and also that it might be a type of the power of faith in Christ to heal all who look to Him because of their sins (Joh 3:14, 15; see also on [86]2Ki 18:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He was delivered from death, and cured of his disease. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses made a serpent of brass,....

Iye-abarim (Heb. <span class="ital">‘Iyyê-hâ‘abhârîm</span>, ‘the Ruins of the ‘Abharim’) is stated to lie ‘over against Moab, on the sunrise (i.e. the eastern) side.’ ‘The ‘<span class="ital">Abharim</span>’ means ‘the parts on the other side,’ a name which was given to the district on the east of the Dead Sea, looked at from the point of view of a dweller in Palestine: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-12.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Get you up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.">Numbers 27:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-47.htm" title="And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.">Numbers 33:47</a> f.

According to that list (41–44) the itinerary was as follows: Mt Hor, Zalmonah, Punon, Oboth, Iye-abarim. The sites of Zalmonah and Punon are quite unknown. But the writer of 33, who clearly intends to trace the journey as completely as possible, omits all reference to the detour by the way to the Red Sea. If, therefore, Mt Hor is the modern Jebel Madurah (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-22.htm" title="And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came to mount Hor.">Numbers 20:22</a>) on the west of Edom, and Iye-abarim is somewhere on the eastern border of Moab, it seems probable that the priestly traditions represented Israel as marching straight through Edom. Whether the account of the hostility of the king of Edom was unknown to P , or whether it was, for some reason, intentionally omitted, we cannot say.

(On the ban, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>). "And they called the place Hormah," i.e., banning, ban-place. "The place" can only mean the spot where the Canaanites were defeated by the Israelites. If the town of Zephath, or the capital of Arad, had been specially intended, it would no doubt have been also mentioned, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>. As it was not the intention of Moses to press into Canaan from the south, across the steep and difficult mountains, for the purpose of effecting its conquest, the Israelites could very well content themselves for the present with the defeat inflicted upon the Canaanites, and defer the complete execution of their vow until the time when they had gained a firm footing in Canaan. The banning of the Canaanites of Arad and its cities necessarily presupposed the immediate conquest of the whole territory, and the laying of all its cities in ashes. And so, again, the introduction of a king of Hormah, i.e., Zephath, among the kings defeated by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>), is no proof that Zephath was conquered and called Hormah in the time of Moses. Zephath may be called Hormah proleptically both there and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a>, as being the southernmost border town of the kingdom of Arad, in consequence of the ban suspended by Moses over the territory of the king of Arad, and may not have received this name till after its conquest by the Judaeans and Simeonites. At the same time, it is quite conceivable that Zephath may have been captured in the time of Joshua, along with the other towns of the south, and called Hormah at that time, but that the Israelites could not hold it then; and therefore, after the departure of the Israelitish army, the old name was restored by the Canaanites, or rather only retained, until the city was retaken and permanently held by the Israelites after Joshua's death (<a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16-17</a>), and received the new name once for all. The allusion to Hormah here, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>, does not warrant the opinion in any case, that it was subsequently to the death of Moses and the conquest of Canaan under Joshua that the war with the Canaanites of Arad and their overthrow occurred. </body></html>
