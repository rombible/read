Jacob foretold that Ephraim should be greater than Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-19.htm" title="And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.">Genesis 48:19</a>); and at the former census the number of the Ephraimites was considerably greater than that of the Manassites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-33.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred.">Numbers 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-35.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Manasseh, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.">Numbers 1:35</a>), and Ephraim was made a standard-bearer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-18.htm" title="On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.">Numbers 2:18</a>). At the present census, however, the number of the Manassites exceeded that of the Ephraimites by 20,200; and yet, in the face of the great increase of Manasseh and the diminution of Ephraim, Moses renewed and confirmed the prediction of Jacob as to the ultimate superiority of Ephraim, and whilst ascribing only “thousands” to Manasseh, he speaks of the “ten thousands of Ephraim” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm" title="His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/26-37.htm" title="These are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those that were numbered of them, thirty and two thousand and five hundred.

Half of these, it seems, had no children, or their families were become extinct, as only five are here named. In amends for the rest, two of his grand-children by the eldest, Bela, namely, Ard and Naaman, became heads of very large families; so that, upon the whole, the sons of Benjamin had increased since the last poll ten thousand two hundred.
