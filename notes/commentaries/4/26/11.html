Neither of the pestilence, nor by fire, nor by the swallowing up of the earth; they not being in the counsel of their father, but followed the doctrine of Moses the prophet, as the Targum of Jonathan; they either disliked their father's scheme, or, if they engaged with him in it, they repented and departed from him, and were not present when the judgments of God came upon him and his company; there were several of his posterity who were singers in the times of David, and to whom many of the psalms were sent to be sung. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="bld">and</span> <span class="ital">the sons of Korah died not</span>] There is no mention of Korah’s family in ch. 16, but the inference might naturally be drawn from <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-32.htm" title="And of Shemida, the family of the Shemidaites: and of Hepher, the family of the Hepherites.">Numbers 26:32</a></span> that they were included in his body of adherents. This inference the writer felt it necessary to check, because in his day ‘sons of Korah’ were found in Jerusalem. They were a subdivision of the Levites, a guild which formed one of the temple choirs. To their hymnbook belonged Psalms 42, 44-49, 84 f., 87 f.

The sons of Korah are frequently mentioned among the Levites, and Samuel himself would seem to have been of them (see on 1 Chronicles 6:22, 28, 33-38, and titles to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42, 88</a>, &c.); it is, however, slightly doubtful whether the Kohathite Korah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-22.htm">1 Chronicles 6:22</a>, the ancestor of Samuel, is the same as the Izharite Korah, the ancestor of Heman, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-38.htm">1 Chronicles 6:38</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The families of Reuben tally with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-9.htm">Genesis 46:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-3.htm">1 Chronicles 5:3</a>. The plural &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (sons), in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-8.htm">Numbers 26:8</a>, where only one son is mentioned, is to be explained from the fact, that several sons of this particular son (i.e., grandsons) are mentioned afterwards. On Dathan and Abiram, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>.
