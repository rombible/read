It is often supposed that this plague carried off the last survivors of the generation condemned at Kadesh (see verse 64); but this is opposed to the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-14.htm">Deuteronomy 2:14, 15</a>, and is essentially improbable. The victims of the plague would surely be those who had joined themselves to Baal-Peor; and these again would surely be the younger, not the older, men in Israel. It is part of the moral of the story that these offenders deprived themselves, not merely of a few remaining days, but of many years of happy rest which might have been theirs. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For this act of divine zeal the eternal possession of the priesthood was promised to Phinehas and his posterity as Jehovah's covenant of peace. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1493;, by displaying my zeal in the midst of them (viz., the Israelites). &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497; is not "zeal for me," but "my zeal," the zeal of Jehovah with which Phinehas was filled, and impelled to put the daring sinners to death. By doing this he had averted destruction from the Israelites, and restrained the working of Jehovah's zeal, which had manifested itself in the plague. "I gave him my covenant of peace" (the suffix is attached to the governing noun, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-2.htm">Genesis 17:2</a>, to give, i.e., to fulfil the covenant, to grant what was promised in the covenant. The covenant granted to Phinehas consisted in the fact, that an "eternal priesthood" (i.e., the eternal possession of the priesthood) was secured to him, not for himself alone, but for his descendants also, as a covenant, i.e., in a covenant, or irrevocable form, since God never breaks a covenant that He has made. In accordance with this promise, the high-priesthood which passed from Eleazar to Phinehas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>) continued in his family, with the exception of a brief interruption in Eli's days (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1.htm">1 Samuel 1-3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>), until the time of the last gradual dissolution of the Jewish state through the tyranny of Herod and his successors (see my Archologie, 38). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-14.htm">Numbers 25:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-15.htm">Numbers 25:15</a>, the names of the two daring sinners are given. The father of Cozbi, the Midianitish princess, was named Zur, and is described here as "head of the tribes (&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>) of a father's house in Midian," i.e., as the head of several of the Midianitish tribes that were descended from one tribe-father; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>, however, he is described as a king, and classed among the five kings of Midian who were slain by the Israelites. </body></html>
