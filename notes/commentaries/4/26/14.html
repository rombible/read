Zimri, the chief offender in the matter of Baal-peor, belonged to this tribe, and, as in the case of the Reubenites, it is probable that he had led astray many of his tribe with him. It is remarkable that this is the only tribe on which, according to the present Hebrew text,<span class= "note">[127]</span> no blessing was pronounced by Moses (Deuteronomy 33), and that in the allotment of the land of Canaan the inheritance of Simeon was only the remnant of that which was assigned to Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-9.htm" title="Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.">Joshua 19:9</a>).<p><span class= "note">[127] The “Codex Alexandrinus” inserts a clause: “Let Simeon be many in number.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-14.htm" title="These are the families of the Simeonites, twenty and two thousand and two hundred.">Numbers 26:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Twenty-two thousand and two hundred </span>— No tribe decreased so much as Simeon’s. From fifty-nine thousand and three hundred it sunk to twenty-two thousand and two hundred, little more than a third of what it was. One whole family of that tribe (Ohad, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-15.htm" title="And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.">Exodus 6:15</a>) was extinct in the wilderness. Some think most of the twenty-four thousand, cut off by the plague for the iniquity of Peor, were of that tribe. For Zimri, a ringleader in that iniquity, was a prince of that tribe. Simeon is not mentioned in Moses’s blessing, Deuteronomy 33. And the lot of that tribe in Canaan was inconsiderable, only a canton out of Judah’s lot, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-9.htm" title="Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.">Joshua 19:9</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:1-51 Moses did not number the people but when God commanded him.

The sons of Simeon&#8212;It is supposed that this tribe had been pre-eminent in the guilt of Baal-peor and had consequently been greatly reduced in numbers.<p>Thus God's justice and holiness, as well as His truth and faithfulness, were strikingly displayed: His justice and holiness in the sweeping judgments that reduced the ranks of some tribes; and His truth and faithfulness in the extraordinary increase of others so that the posterity of Israel continued a numerous people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Whereas there were 35,400 in <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-23.htm" title="Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of Simeon, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.">Numbers 1:23</a></span>.

This tribe was next numbered, not only because Simeon was next to Reuben by birth, but because his tribe was under the standard of Reuben; two of his sons are a little differently named here than they are in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-10.htm">Genesis 46:10</a>, there the eldest is called Jemuel, here Nemuel; there the youngest but one is named Zohar, here Zerah; and one of them is here omitted, namely Ohad, perhaps because he died without children, and so no family sprang from him; wherefore the families of Simeon were but five, and the number of them were 22,200; by which it appears there was a very great decrease in this tribe since the last muster, even 37,100 which in some measure is to be accounted for by the great number of this tribe supposed to have died of the plague, on account of fornication and idolatry, made mention of in the preceding chapter; a prince in this tribe having set a bad example, it is probable he was followed in it by many of it, for which great numbers were cut off. Jarchi, from Tanchuma, says, that all the 24,000 that died of the plague was of the tribe of Simeon; and so says the Samaritan Chronicle (o); but that is not likely. <p>(o) Apud Hottinger. ut supra.
