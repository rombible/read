Others make them distinct families, because Machir had other children, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-23.htm" title="And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.">Genesis 1:23</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/7-14.htm" title="The sons of Manasseh; Ashriel, whom she bore: (but his concubine the Aramitess bore Machir the father of Gilead:...">1 Chronicles 7:14-16</a></span>, which are called by their father’s name, Machirites, whereas the children of his eldest son Gilead are called by his name, Gileadites.

Manasseh is here mentioned first, though Ephraim was preferred to him by Jacob, and the standard belonged to him; not because he was the firstborn, but because he had now the greater increase, though he had but one son, Machir, of whom was the family of the Machirites, and a grandson, whose name was Gilead, from whom was the family of the Gileadites, and who had six sons; of whom were the families of the Jeezerite, Halekite, Asrielite, Shechemite, Shemidaite, and Hepherite. Hepher, of whom was the last, had a son named Zelophehad, but he had no son, only five daughters, whose names are given; the number of men in this tribe, of twenty years old and upwards, fit for war, was 52,700, so that the increase was 20,500, a large increase indeed! <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Of the sons of Manasseh: of Machir, the family of the Machirites: and Machir begat Gilead: of Gilead come the family of the Gileadites.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sons of Manasseh.</span> There is considerable difficulty about the families of this tribe, because they are not recorded in Genesis, while the details preserved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14-17</a> are so obscure and fragmentary as to be extremely perplexing. According to the present enumeration there were eight families in Manasseh, one named after his son Machir, one after his grandson Gilead, and the rest after his great-grandsons. The list given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1, 2</a> agrees with this, except that the Machirites and the Gileadites are apparently identified. It appears from the genealogy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7.htm">1 Chronicles 7</a> that the mother of Machir was a stranger from Aram, the country of Laban. This may perhaps account for the fact that Machir's son received the name of Gilead, for Gilead was the border land between Aram and Canaan; it more probably explains the subsequent allotment of territory in that direction to the Machirites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40</a>). Gilead appears again as a proper name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-2.htm">Judges 11:2</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The families of Issachar correspond to the sons mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-13.htm">Genesis 46:13</a>, except that the name Job occurs there instead of Jashub.
