The extent of territory was to be determined by the number of names—i.e., of persons—in each tribe, and each inheritance was to bear the name of the ancestor of the tribe. Rashi says that the names of the twelve tribes were written on twelve scrolls of parchment, and twelve borders, or limits of land, on twelve others, and that they were mixed together in an urn.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-53.htm" title="To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.">Numbers 26:53</a></span>. <span class="ital">The land shall be divided — </span>The land was divided into nine parts and a half, respect being had in such division to the goodness as well as to the largeness of the several portions, and the lot gave each tribe their part. <span class="ital">Of names — </span>Of persons: the share of each tribe was divided among the several families, to some more, to some less, according to the number of persons of each family.
