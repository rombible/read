To a tribe more numerous, and consisting of more and larger families, a greater part of the land was to be given to them to possess; and to a smaller tribe, and of the fewer families and persons in them, a lesser share of it: this direction is given to Moses, but is not designed for him personally, for he never entered the land, but died before Israel went into it; but for the chief ruler that would be then in being, namely, Joshua, his successor: <p>to everyone shall his inheritance be given, according to those that were numbered of him; that is, to every tribe, and so to every family in it, according to the number of men in it, that were of the above age when the sum of them was taken: because it is in the original text, "to a man according to those numbered of him", &amp;c.

This appears to be the view taken in the early passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?...">Jdg 1:1-3</a>.

We must probably, therefore, understand ‘thou shalt give’ loosely—‘thou shalt command that it be given.’ This is more clearly expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/33-50.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,...">Numbers 33:50-54</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to those that were numbered of him</span>] i.e. in proportion to his (the tribe’s) numbers.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The families of Naphtali tally with the sons of Naphtali in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-24.htm">Genesis 46:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-30.htm">1 Chronicles 7:30</a>.</body></html>
