We have here the families registered, as well as the tribes. The total was nearly the same as when numbered at mount Sinai. Notice is here taken of the children of Korah; they died not, as the children of Dathan and Abiram; they seem not to have joined even their own father in rebellion. If we partake not of the sins of sinners, we shall not partake of their plagues.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Following The tribes are mentioned in the same order as in the earlier census <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, except that Manasseh here precedes Ephraim; probably as being now the larger tribe.<p>The following table shows the numbers of the tribes at each census; at Sinai, and in the Plains of Moab:<p> At Sinai Plains of Moab  Reuben 46,500 43,730  Simeon 9,300 22,200  Gad 45,650 40,500  Judah 74,600 76,500  Issachar 54,400 64,300  Zebulun 57,400 60,500  Ephraim 40,500 32,500  Manasseh 32,200 52,700  Benjamin 35,400 45,600  <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/62.htm">Daniel 62</a>,700 64,400  Asher 41,500 53,400  Naphtali 53,400 45,400  Totals 603, 550 601, 730  <p>Seven of the tribes, of which three are tribes belonging to the camp of Judah, show an increase of numbers; and five, among whom are the three belonging to the camp of Reuben, show a decrease. The greatest increase of any one tribe is in Manasseh. The most remarkable decrease is in Simeon, which now shows less than half its former strength. To this tribe Zimri, the chief offender in the recent transgression, belonged <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-14.htm">Numbers 25:14</a>. Probably his tribesmen generally had followed his example, and had accordingly suffered most severely in the plague. In the parting blessing of Moses, uttered at no great interval from this date, the tribe of Simeon alone is omitted.<p>The families of all the tribes, excluding the Levites, number 57. The ancestral heads after whom these families are named correspond nearly with the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Jacob, enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8</a> ff. Both lists consist mainly of grandchildren of Jacob, both contain also the same two grandchildren of Judah, and the same two grandchildren of Asher. The document in Genesis should be regarded as a list, not of those who went down in their own persons with Jacob into Egypt, but of those whose names were transmitted to their posterity at the date of the Exodus as the heads of Israelite houses, and wire may thus be reckoned the early ancestors of the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Take the sum of all the congregation&#8212;The design of this new census, after a lapse of thirty-eight years, was primarily to establish the vast multiplication of the posterity of Abraham in spite of the severe judgments inflicted upon them; secondarily, it was to preserve the distinction of families and to make arrangements, preparatory to an entrance into the promised land, for the distribution of the country according to the relative population of the tribes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Reuben, the eldest son of Israel,.... the number of his tribe is taken first on that account; there were four families that descended from him, the Hanochite, Palluite, Hesronite, and Carmite, and the number of men from twenty years old and upwards, fit for war, were 43,730; so that, since the last numbering, this tribe was decreased 2770; which may in part be accounted for by the families of Dathan and Abiram being cut off for their rebellion, who were this tribe, and whose affair is briefly related in the following verses, and it may be to point out this unto us. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites: of Carmi, the family of the Carmites.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Lord now commanded Moses to show hostility (&#1510;&#1512;&#1512; to the Midianites, and smite them, on account of the stratagem which they had practised upon the Israelites by tempting them to idolatry, "in order that the practical zeal of Phinehas against sin, by which expiation had been made for the guilt, might be adopted by all the nation" (Baumgarten).
