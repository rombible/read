The Samaritan Pentateuch, however, has a different reading here. It transposes the words “and Korah,” and combines them with the words”and the two hundred and fifty men”: thus—“when the fire devoured Korah and the two hundred and fifty men.” (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.">Numbers 16:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-35.htm" title="And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.">Numbers 16:35</a>.) It is possible that there may have been an omission here of the words which are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.">Numbers 16:32</a>, “all the men that appertained unto,” or of words denoting “all the goods belonging to.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-10.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.">Numbers 26:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Together with Korah — </span>These words seem to import that Korah was swallowed up with Dathan and Abiram. But it being more probable, as was observed on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.">Numbers 16:32</a>, that Korah was consumed by the <span class="ital">fire of God </span>with those who offered incense, the words may be otherwise translated thus: <span class="ital">The earth swallowed them up; </span>namely, Dathan and Abiram; and as for Korah, he died <span class="ital">with that company, what time the fire devoured, </span>&c. — To the same purpose speak the Samaritan text and Josephus. “Also we have the testimony of the apostolical constitutions, and in effect of Clement of Rome, of Ignatius and Eusebius, that the Septuagint version originally gave the same account.” — Whiston. Junius and Tremellius render the passage, <span class="ital">The earth swallowed them up, and what things belonged to Korah; </span>namely, his tent, and goods, and family, his children excepted, as they are here. The psalmist seems to confirm the opinion that Korah was burned with his Levites, mentioning only Dathan and Abiram as being swallowed up, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-17.htm" title="The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.">Psalm 106:17</a>. <span class="ital">They became a sign — </span>A monument of divine vengeance against daring sinners, warning them not to rebel against God, or magistrates, his deputies, nor to usurp the priestly office.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:1-51 Moses did not number the people but when God commanded him.

This distinct statement, which is not modified in the Targums, seems decisive as to the fate of Korah. If indeed it were quite certain from the detailed narrative in chapter 16 that Korah perished with his own company, and not  with the Reubenites, then it might be deemed necessary to force this statement into accordance with that certainty; but it is nowhere stated, or even clearly implied, that he perished by fire, and therefore there is no excuse for doing violence to the obvious meaning of this verse. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were swallowed up, we are told, at the same time that Korah's company were consumed by fire; that is a clear statement, and cannot be set aside by any supposed necessity for avenging the sacri1egious ambition of Korah by the element of fire. <span class="cmt_word">And they became a sign.</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>properly means a banner or ensign, and is unusual in this sense. It exactly corresponds, however, to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and has no doubt the same secondary signification - a something made conspicuous in order to attract attention and enforce a warning (cf. chapter Numbers 16:30, 38). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them" (&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; with the accusative, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>). The pronoun refers to "the children of Israel," or more correctly, to the heads of the nation as the representatives of the congregation, who were to carry out the numbering.
