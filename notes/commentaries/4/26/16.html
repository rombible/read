Seven families sprang from Gad, whose number now was 40,500; they were diminished since their last numbering 5150; it is probable this tribe, being a warlike tribe, suffered very much in their attempt to enter the land of Canaan contrary to the will of God, and were repulsed and defeated by the Amalekites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Of Ozni, the family of the Oznites: of Eri, the family of the Erites:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/26.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The families of Reuben tally with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-9.htm">Genesis 46:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-3.htm">1 Chronicles 5:3</a>.
