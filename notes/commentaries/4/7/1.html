The Princes' Offerings.<p>1. the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle&#8212;Those who take the word "day" as literally pointing to the exact date of the completion of the tabernacle, are under a necessity of considering the sacred narrative as disjointed, and this portion of the history from the seventh to the eleventh chapters as out of its place&#8212;the chronology requiring that it should have immediately followed the fortieth chapter of Exodus, which relates that the tabernacle was reared on the first day of the first month of the second year [Ex 40:17]. But that the term "day" is used in a loose and indeterminate sense, as synonymous with time, is evident from the fact that not one day but several days were occupied with the transactions about to be described. So that this chapter stands in its proper place in the order of the history; after the tabernacle and its instruments (the altar and its vessels) had been anointed (Le 8:10), the Levites separated to the sacred service&#8212;the numbering of the people, and the disposal of the tribes about the tabernacle, in a certain order, which was observed by the princes in the presentation of their offerings. This would fix the period of the imposing ceremonial described in this chapter about a month after the completion of the tabernacle.The tabernacle being fully finished, the twelve princes offer gifts; which are delivered to the Gershonites and the Merarites, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;...">Numbers 7:1-11</a></span>.

Strictly speaking it should mean the first day of the first month of the second year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>); and so the Targum of Palestine, "It was on the day which begins the month Nisan." It is, however, quite clear from the narrative itself, as well as from its position, that the offerings were not actually made until after the taking of the census and the distribution of their respective duties to the Levitical families, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, until the eve of the departure from Sinai. Moreover, since the same phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, occurs in verse 10, it is certain that it cannot apply to the actual presentation of the offerings, which was spread over twelve days (verse 11). The majority, therefore, of the commentators would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>, "at the time." It is, however, impossible to admit that there is any similarity whatever between the two passages. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a> the context itself, as well as the subject matter, oblige us to understand the phrase in the looser sense; but in a plain historical account such as the present the obligation is all the other way. Either the date here given is a mistake (which, on any supposition, is most improbable), or it must be referred to the intention and inception of the princely offerings, the actual presentation being made at the time indicated in the narrative, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in the first half of the second month. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">had anointed</span> it. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>, as compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>, it would rather appear that Moses did not anoint the tabernacle on the day it was set up, but on some subsequent day. It is, however, a mistake to suppose that the tabernacle and the holy things were anointed through seven successive days: the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-33.htm">Leviticus 8:33-35</a> refers only to the consecration of the priests. Since the anointing of the tabernacle was connected with the setting of it up, as the last act of one ceremonial, and was only unavoidably postponed, there is nothing remarkable in the two things being spoken of as if they had taken place on one and the same day. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Priestly or Aaronic Blessing. - The spiritual character of the congregation of Israel culminated in the blessing with which the priests were to bless the people. The directions as to this blessing, therefore, impressed the seal of perfection upon the whole order and organization of the people of God, inasmuch as Israel was first truly formed into a congregation of Jehovah by the fact that God not only bestowed His blessing upon it, but placed the communication of this blessing in the hands of the priests, the chosen and constant mediators of the blessings of His grace, and imposed it upon them as one portion of their official duty. The blessing which the priests were to impart to the people, consisted of a triple blessing of two members each, which stood related to each other thus: The second in each case contained a special application of the first to the people, and the three gradations unfolded the substance of the blessing step by step with ever increasing emphasis. - The first (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24</a>), "Jehovah bless thee and keep thee," conveyed the blessing in the most general form, merely describing it as coming from Jehovah, and setting forth preservation from the evil of the world as His work. "The blessing of God is the goodness of God in action, by which a supply of all good pours down to us from His good favour as from their only fountain; then follows, secondly, the prayer that He would keep the people, which signifies that He alone is the defender of the Church, and that it is He who preserves it with His guardian care" (Calvin). - The second (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-25.htm">Numbers 6:25</a>), "Jehovah make His face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee," defined the blessing more closely as the manifestation of the favour and grace of God. The face of God is the personality of God as turned towards man. Fire goes out from Jehovah's face, and consumes the enemy and the rebellious (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-2.htm">Leviticus 10:2</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-10.htm">Numbers 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-3.htm">Numbers 20:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-22.htm">Exodus 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>), and also a sunlight shining with love and full of life and good (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-20.htm">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-4.htm">Psalm 44:4</a>). If "the light of the sun is sweet, and pleasant for the eyes to behold" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a>), "the light of the divine countenance, the everlasting light (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-10.htm">Psalm 36:10</a>), is the sum of all delight" (Baumg.). This light sends rays of mercy into a heart in need of salvation, and makes it the recipient of grace. - The third (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-26.htm">Numbers 6:26</a>), "Jehovah lift up His face to thee, and set (or give) thee peace" (good, salvation), set forth the blessing of God as a manifestation of power, or a work of power upon man, the end of which is peace (shalom), the sum of all the good which God sets, prepares, or establishes for His people. &#1488;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;, to lift up the face to any one, is equivalent to looking at him, and does not differ from &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; or &#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-29.htm">Genesis 43:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-21.htm">Genesis 44:21</a>). When affirmed of God, it denotes His providential work upon man. When God looks at a man, He saves him out of his distresses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-7.htm">Psalm 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-16.htm">Psalm 34:16</a>). - In these three blessings most of the fathers and earlier theologians saw an allusion to the mystery of the Trinity, and rested their conclusion, (a) upon the triple repetition of the name Jehovah; (b) upon the ratio praedicati, that Jehovah, by whom the blessing is desired and imparted, is the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and (c) upon the distinctorum benedictionis membrorum consideratio, according to which bis trina beneficia are mentioned (cf. Calovii Bibl. illustr. ad h. l.). There is truth in this, though the grounds assigned seem faulty. As the threefold repetition of a word or sentence serves to express the thought as strongly as possible (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>), the triple blessing expressed in the most unconditional manner the thought, that God would bestow upon His congregation the whole fulness of the blessing enfolded in His Divine Being which was manifested as Jehovah. But not only does the name Jehovah denote God as the absolute Being, who revealed Himself as Father, Son, and Spirit in the historical development of His purpose of salvation for the redemption of fallen man; but the substance of this blessing, which He caused to be pronounced upon His congregation, unfolded the grace of God in the threefold way in which it is communicated to us through the Father, Son, and Spirit.<p>(Note: See the admirable elaboration of these points in Luther's exposition of the blessing. Luther refers the first blessing to "bodily life and good." The blessing, he says, desired for the people "that God would give them prosperity and every good, and also guard and preserve them." This is carried out still further, in a manner corresponding to his exposition of the first article. The second blessing he refers to "the spiritual nature and the soul," and observes, "Just as the sun, when it rises and diffuses its rich glory and soft light over all the world, merely lifts up its face upon all the world;...so when God gives His word, He causes His face to shine clearly and joyously upon all minds, and makes them joyful and light, and as it were new hearts and new men. For it brings forgiveness of sins, and shows God as a gracious and merciful Father, who pities and sympathizes with our grief and sorrow. The third also relates to the spiritual nature and the soul, and is a desire for consolation and final victory over the cross, death, the devil, and all the gates of hell, together with the world and the evil desires of the flesh. The desire of this blessing is, that the Lord God will lift up the light of His word upon us, and so keep it over us, that it may shine in our hearts with strength enough to overcome all the opposition of the devil, death, and sin, and all adversity, terror, or despair.") </body></html>
