We should concern ourselves, both in our prayers and in our endeavours, for the rising generation, that religion may be maintained and advanced, when we are in our graves. God appoints a successor, even Joshua; who had signalized himself by his courage in fighting Amalek, his humility in ministering to Moses, and his faith and sincerity in witnessing against the report of the evil spies. This man God appoints to succeed Moses; a man in whom is the Spirit, the Spirit of grace. He is a good man, fearing God and hating covetousness, and acting from principle. He has the spirit of government; he is fit to do the work and discharge the trusts of his place. He has a spirit of conduct and courage; he had also the Spirit of prophecy. That man is not fully qualified for any service in the church of Christ, who is destitute of the graces and gifts of the Holy Spirit, whatever human abilities he may possess. And in Joshua's succession we are reminded that the law was given by Moses, who by reason of our transgression could not bring us to heaven; but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, for the salvation of every believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest ... - Joshua was thus to be inferior to what Moses had been. For Moses had enjoyed the privilege of unrestricted direct contact with God: Joshua, like all future rulers of Israel, was to ask counsel mediately, through the High Priest and those means of inquiring of God wherewith the high priest was entrusted. Such counsel Joshua seems to have omitted to seek when he concluded his hasty treaty with the Gibeonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3</a> ff).<p>Judgment of Urim - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21. Thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him&#8212;In the whole history of Israel there arose no prophet or ruler in all respects like unto Moses till the Messiah appeared, whose glory eclipsed all. But Joshua was honored and qualified in an eminent degree, through the special service of the high priest, who asked counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he laid his hands upon him,....

The announcement thus made to Moses led him to entreat the Lord to appoint a leader of His people, that the congregation might not be like a flock without a shepherd. As "God of the spirits of all flesh," i.e., as the giver of life and breath to all creatures (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>), he asks Jehovah to appoint a man over the congregation, who should go out and in before them, and should lead them out and in, i.e., preside over and direct them in all their affairs. &#1493;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; ("go out," and "go in") is a description of the conduct of men in every-day life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-11.htm">Joshua 14:11</a>). &#1493;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; &#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; ("lead out," and "bring in") signifies the superintendence of the affairs of the nation, and is founded upon the figure of a shepherd. </body></html>
