It is but to die as they died, having lived as they lived; and as their end was peace, why should we fear any evil in the passage of that dark valley?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Mount Abarim - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-20.htm">Numbers 21:20</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Nu 27:12-17.

The privation of this great honor was owing to the unhappy conduct he had manifested in the striking of the rock at Meribah [Nu 20:12]; and while the pious leader submitted with meek acquiescence to the divine decree, he evinced the spirit of genuine patriotism in his fervent prayers for the appointment of a worthy and competent successor [Nu 27:15-17].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In Kadesh:</span> this is added to distinguish this miscarriage of Moses from that of the people in Rephidim, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-7.htm" title="And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?">Exodus 17:7</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For ye rebelled against my commandment the desert of Zin,....

It is impossible to suppose that they formed part of the Divine message; nor does it seem probable that Moses would have added them to the narrative as it stands, because, in view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>, no necessity for explanation existed. It is quite possible that both <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a> and the present clause are subsequent additions to the text intended  to clear up an obvious confusion between the "strife" at Rephidim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>) and that at Kadesh. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On this occasion God issued a general law of inheritance, which was to apply to all cases as "a statute of judgment" (or right), i.e., a statute determining right. If any one died without leaving a son, his landed property was to pass to his daughter (or daughters); in default of daughters, to his brothers; in the absence of brothers, to his paternal uncles; and if there were none of them, to his next of kin. - On the intention of this law, see my Archaeol. 142 (ii. pp. 212, 213); and on the law of inheritance generally, see J. Selden, de success. ad leges Hebr. in bona defunctorum, Fkft. a. O. 1695. </body></html>
