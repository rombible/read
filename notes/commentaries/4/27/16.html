Instead of indulging in excessive grief, or in unavailing remorse, the mind of Moses was intently fixed upon the welfare of those for whose sake he had been willing that his own name should be blotted out of the Book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm" title="Yet now, if you will forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.">Exodus 32:32</a>); and instead of appointing one of his own family, or the man of his own choice, as his successor, he commits the matter to God, and prays that He will appoint one who would be a true shepherd to the flock.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-16.htm" title="Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation,">Numbers 27:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">The God of the spirits of all flesh — </span>God of all men; the Searcher of spirits, that knowest who is fit for this great employment; the Father, and Giver, and Governor of spirits, who canst raise and suit the spirits of men to the highest and hardest works.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:15-23 Envious spirits do not love their successors; but Moses was not one of these. We should concern ourselves, both in our prayers and in our endeavours, for the rising generation, that religion may be maintained and advanced, when we are in our graves. God appoints a successor, even Joshua; who had signalized himself by his courage in fighting Amalek, his humility in ministering to Moses, and his faith and sincerity in witnessing against the report of the evil spies. This man God appoints to succeed Moses; a man in whom is the Spirit, the Spirit of grace. He is a good man, fearing God and hating covetousness, and acting from principle. He has the spirit of government; he is fit to do the work and discharge the trusts of his place. He has a spirit of conduct and courage; he had also the Spirit of prophecy. That man is not fully qualified for any service in the church of Christ, who is destitute of the graces and gifts of the Holy Spirit, whatever human abilities he may possess. And in Joshua's succession we are reminded that the law was given by Moses, who by reason of our transgression could not bring us to heaven; but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, for the salvation of every believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The God of the spirits of all flesh - An acknowledgment that man, who is but flesh (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>), is of himself helpless; and "lives and moves and has his being" in God <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>.

If any one died without leaving a son, his landed property was to pass to his daughter (or daughters); in default of daughters, to his brothers; in the absence of brothers, to his paternal uncles; and if there were none of them, to his next of kin. - On the intention of this law, see my Archaeol. 142 (ii. pp. 212, 213); and on the law of inheritance generally, see J.
