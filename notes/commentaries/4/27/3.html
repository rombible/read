Their believing expectation that the word of the Lord would be performed in due season, and their desire of an interest in the promised inheritance; and the modest, candid manner in which they asked, without secret murmurs or discontents, are a good example. They ask for a possession in the land of Canaan. Herein they discovered, 1. Strong faith in the power and promise of God, concerning the giving of the land of Canaan to Israel. 2. And earnest desire of a place and name in the land of promise, which was a type of heaven. 3. Respect and honour for their father, whose name was dear to them now he was gone. He never had done any thing that might bar his children's claim. It is a comfort to parents when they come to die, if though they have smarted for their own sin, yet they are not conscious of any of those iniquities which God will visit on their children. God himself gives judgment. He takes notice of the affairs, not only of nations, but of private families, and orders them according to his will. The petition is granted. Those who seek an inheritance in the land of promise, shall have what they seek for, and other things shall be added to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But died in his own sin - i. e., perished under the general sentence of exclusion from the land of promise passed on all the older generation, but limited to that generation alone.

Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not &#8230; in the company of &#8230; Korah&#8212;This declaration might be necessary because his death might have occurred about the time of that rebellion; and especially because, as the children of these conspirators were involved along with their fathers in the awful punishment, their plea appeared the more proper and forcible that their father did not die for any cause that doomed his family to lose their lives or their inheritance.<p>died in his own sin&#8212;that is, by the common law of mortality to which men, through sin, are subject.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He was not in the company of Korah, </span> nor in any other rebellion of the people, which must be understood, because all of them are opposed to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">his own sin, </span> in which alone he is said to die.

Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Because peradventure he died about that time, and therefore might be presumed guilty of that crime. Or rather, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. Because that sin, and, as it may seem, that only of all the sins committed in the wilderness, was of such a flagitious nature, that God thought fit to extend the punishment not only to the persons of those rebels, but also to their children and families, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-27.htm" title="So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.">Numbers 16:27</a>,32</span>, as was usual in like cases, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-15.htm" title="You shall surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.">Deu 13:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm" title="And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.">Joshua 7:24</a></span>; whence it is noted as a singular privilege granted to the <span class="ital">children of Korah</span>, that they <span class="ital">died not</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-11.htm" title="Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.">Numbers 26:11</a></span>, whereas the children of their confederates died with them.

As all the generation of the children of Israel did, that came out of Egypt, who were twenty years old and upwards, excepting Joshua and Caleb: <p>and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company of Korah; which is observed, not so much to obtain the favour and good will of Moses as to clear the memory of their father from any reproach upon it, he dying in the wilderness; and chiefly to show that the claim of his posterity to a share in the land was not forfeited, he not being in that rebellion, nor in any other; so that he and his were never under any attainder: <p>but died in his own sin; which though common to all men, every man has his own peculiar way of sinning, and is himself only answerable for it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a> he sinned alone, had no partner or confederate, whom he had drawn into any notorious and public sin, as mutiny, &amp;c. to the prejudice of the state, and the rulers in it; so the Targum of Jonathan adds,"and he did not cause others to sin,''so Jarchi; some take him to be the sabbath breaker, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32</a>, others that he was one of those that went up the hill, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>, most likely his sin was that of unbelief, disbelieving the spies that brought the good report of the land, and giving credit to those that brought an ill report of it; and so with the rest of the people murmured, for which his carcass, with others, fell in the wilderness, and entered not into the good land, through unbelief: a sin not punished in their children: <p>and had no sons. which was the reason of this application. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> sin, and had no sons.</span><p>(a) According as all men die, for as much as they are sinners.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">he died in his own sin</span>] in the ordinary sinfulness of a man, like the rest of his generation who died during the forty years in the wilderness.
