From this and similar passages, it appears that the authority of the judge, or chief magistrate in Israel, however great, was not arbitrary, since in great emergencies he was obliged to have recourse to the high-priest, who was to ask counsel for him at the oracle. And some weighty matters were proposed to the congregation and princes, or senate of Israel, for their consent or decision. <span class="ital">After the judgment of Urim — </span>It appears from several passages, particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-18.htm" title="And Saul said to Ahiah, Bring here the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.">1 Samuel 14:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-2.htm" title="Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines?

And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.">1 Samuel 30:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-19.htm" title="And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.">2 Samuel 5:19</a>, that the high-priest, in consulting the oracle, was clothed with the ephod, or the sacerdotal vestment, to which belonged the breast- plate, and the Urim and Thummim. Thus, when David wanted to consult the oracle, he said to the priest, Bring hither the ephod: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-7.htm" title="And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.">1 Samuel 30:7</a>. In this and other places God is said to have answered him, but in what manner we are not told, only it appears to have been by a voice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-3.htm" title="So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.">1 Samuel 30:3</a>. But who uttered that voice, is a question. Spencer is of opinion that it was God himself, or an angel acting by commission from God. Le Clerc again contends that it was the high-priest himself that pronounced the words, but that he spake by divine inspiration: see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>. <span class="ital">At his word shall they go out, </span>&c. — That is, at the word of the Lord, delivered by the mouth of the priest. This shows the nature of the Jewish government, and that it is not without reason called a <span class="ital">theocracy, </span>or divine government; since no enterprise of moment was to be undertaken without first consulting the oracle of God by the priest. However, this is to be understood principally of their going out, or not going out, to war; upon which occasion chiefly the oracle was consulted, especially to know the event of it: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm" title="Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?">Jdg 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-18.htm" title="And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin?

We may observe, that though Joshua was greatly inferior to Moses in this respect, he generally consulted God by the high- priest; whereas Moses had immediate access to God himself, and spake with him face to face; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-10.htm" title="And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>;) yet God sometimes vouchsafed the same honour to Joshua, and spake to him without the mediation of the priest: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.">Joshua 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,">Joshua 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-15.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,">Joshua 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-13.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?">Joshua 5:13</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:15-23 Envious spirits do not love their successors; but Moses was not one of these. We should concern ourselves, both in our prayers and in our endeavours, for the rising generation, that religion may be maintained and advanced, when we are in our graves. God appoints a successor, even Joshua; who had signalized himself by his courage in fighting Amalek, his humility in ministering to Moses, and his faith and sincerity in witnessing against the report of the evil spies. This man God appoints to succeed Moses; a man in whom is the Spirit, the Spirit of grace. He is a good man, fearing God and hating covetousness, and acting from principle. He has the spirit of government; he is fit to do the work and discharge the trusts of his place. He has a spirit of conduct and courage; he had also the Spirit of prophecy. That man is not fully qualified for any service in the church of Christ, who is destitute of the graces and gifts of the Holy Spirit, whatever human abilities he may possess. And in Joshua's succession we are reminded that the law was given by Moses, who by reason of our transgression could not bring us to heaven; but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, for the salvation of every believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest ... - Joshua was thus to be inferior to what Moses had been. For Moses had enjoyed the privilege of unrestricted direct contact with God: Joshua, like all future rulers of Israel, was to ask counsel mediately, through the High Priest and those means of inquiring of God wherewith the high priest was entrusted. Such counsel Joshua seems to have omitted to seek when he concluded his hasty treaty with the Gibeonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3</a> ff).<p>Judgment of Urim - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21.

This was for the honour of God, whose priest Eleazar was, and whose oracle was consulted by him; for it is said (z), the high priest did not come into the presence of the king but when he pleased; and he did not stand before him, but the king stood before the high priest, as it is said, "and before Eleazar the priest shall he stand"; though it is commanded the high priest to honour the king, and to rise up and stand when he comes unto him; and the king does not stand before him, but when he consults for him by the judgment of Urim; and his posture seems to be different from other persons that consulted; for the same writer (a) observes, in answer to a question,"how do they consult? the priest stands, and his face is before the ark, and he that consults is behind him, and his face to the back of the priest;''whereas here Joshua stood before the priest, and so any king or supreme governor: <p>who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord: of the Urim and Thummim which were in the breastplate of judgment, and of consultation by them; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a> and from this place the Jews (b) infer that consultation was not made by them for a private person, but for a king, or for one the congregation stood in need of: <p>at his word shall they go out, and at his word shall they come in; go out to war, and return from it, or do any service enjoined them; that is, either at the word of the Lord, or rather at the word of Eleazar the priest, declaring the will of God, which comes to much the same sense; or at the word of Joshua, directed by the high priest, according to the oracle of God; and he being under such direction, the people could never do amiss in obeying him, or be in any fear or danger of being led wrong by him; but he is mentioned in the next clause, as included in those that went out, and came in: <p>both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation; which Maimonides (c) interprets thus, "he", this is the king; "and all the children of Israel", this is the anointed for war, or he whom the congregation hath need of; "and all the congregation", these are the great sanhedrim, or seventy elders. <p>(z) Maimon.

Moses was as much above the priests as he was above the tribe princes; but Joshua was only the civil and military head of the nation, and was as much subordinate to the high priest in one way as the high priest was subordinate to him in another. In after times no doubt the political headship quite overpowered and overshadowed the ecclesiastical, but this does not seem to have been so intended, or to have been the case in Eleazar's lifetime.

The Urim of this passage and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a> seems identical with the Urim and Thummim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-8.htm">Leviticus 8:8</a>. What it actually was, and how it was used in con-suiting God, is not told us in Scripture, and has left no reliable trace in the tradition of the Jews; it must, therefore, remain for ever an insoluble mystery. It does not appear that Moses ever sought the judgment of Urim, for he possessed more direct means of ascertaining the will of God; nor does it seem ever to have been resorted to after the time of David, for the "more sure word of prophecy" superseded it. Its real use, therefore, belonged to the dark ages of Israel, after the light of Moses had set, and before the light of the prophets had arisen. At his word. Literally, after his mouth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the decision of Eleazar, given after consulting God by means of the Urim (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Consecration of Joshua as the Successor of Moses. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-15.htm">Numbers 27:15-17</a>. The announcement thus made to Moses led him to entreat the Lord to appoint a leader of His people, that the congregation might not be like a flock without a shepherd. As "God of the spirits of all flesh," i.e., as the giver of life and breath to all creatures (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>), he asks Jehovah to appoint a man over the congregation, who should go out and in before them, and should lead them out and in, i.e., preside over and direct them in all their affairs. &#1493;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1510;&#1488;&#1514; ("go out," and "go in") is a description of the conduct of men in every-day life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-11.htm">Joshua 14:11</a>). &#1493;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; &#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488; ("lead out," and "bring in") signifies the superintendence of the affairs of the nation, and is founded upon the figure of a shepherd. </body></html>
