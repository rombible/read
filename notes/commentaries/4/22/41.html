Hengstenberg observes that “Balak started with the supposition that Balaam must necessarily have the Israelites in view if his curse was to take effect.”<p><span class= "bld">That thence he might see the utmost part of the people.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">And he saw from thence, &c. </span>If the Authorised Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-13.htm" title="And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from from where you may see them: you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there.">Numbers 23:13</a> is correct, it seems necessary to understand these words as denoting that Balaam had a view from Bamoth-Baal of the whole army of Israel, even to the very extremity. or utmost part of the camp. This verse, however, is more commonly interpreted as denoting that Balaam saw only the extremity of the camp. So the Targum of Palestine: “He saw from thence the camp of Dan, which went at the rear of the people.” (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-13.htm" title="And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from from where you may see them: you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there.">Numbers 23:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-41.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that there he might see the utmost part of the people.">Numbers 22:41</a></span>. <span class="ital">The high places of Baal — </span>Consecrated to the worship of Baal, that is, of <span class="ital">Baal-peor, </span>who was their <span class="ital">Baal, </span>or <span class="ital">lord, </span>as the word signifies, a name given to several gods, both male and female.

To several of these high places Balak brought Balaam, that he might see where he could take the fullest view of the Israelites; for in those solemn imprecations it was judged necessary to have the persons devoted present to the view of him who pronounced the malediction.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:36-41 Balak has now nothing to complain of, but that Balaam did not come sooner. Balaam bids Balak not depend too much upon him. He seems to speak with vexation; but is really as desirous to please Balak, as ever he had pretended to be to please God. See what need we have to pray every day, Our Father which art in heaven, lead us not into temptation.

The day after the arrival of Balaam at Balak's royal seat, and after the entertainment given him, and the princes, "on the morning" (y) of that day, as the word signifies; and perhaps early in the morning, the king eager to be about business, and get the people of Israel cursed if possible as soon as could be: <p>that Balak took Balaam and brought him up into the high places of Baal; where groves were planted, and altars erected to that "idol" and which the Targum of Jonathan calls the idol Peor, the same with Baalpeor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-3.htm">Numbers 25:3</a> which might be their god Chemosh, the same with Bacchus or Priapus: <p>that thence he might see the utmost part of the people; the whole host of Israel, even to the extreme part of it; the camp of Dan, as the Targum of Jonathan, which brought up the rear; he had him to those high places, both that he might have a better view of the whole body of the people, and know how they lay, and to direct his curses at them, and that success might attend the undertaking, these being places of religious worship.

But the country north of the Arnon was then in possession not of the Moabites but of the Amorites. If we knew more of the facts the difficulty might be explained; but it is not impossible that the narrative is to be considered in the light of a popular tradition which was poetical, and that the details must not be rigidly pressed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Chapter 22:41.</span> - The high places of Baal, or "Bamoth-Baal." Perhaps the Bamoth mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-19.htm">Numbers 21:19, 20</a>. This is, however, by no means certain, because high places were no doubt numerous, and that Bamoth would seem to have been too far from the present camp of Israel. In any case they crossed the Arnon, and ran some risk by adventuring themselves on hostile territory. <span class="cmt_word">That thence he might see the utmost part of the people.</span> According to the quasi-sacramental character attributed to the cursing of a seer, it was held necessary that the subject of the curse should be in view. Balak desired to attain this object with as little risk as possible, and therefore he took Balaam first of all to these heights, whence a distant and partial view of Israel might be had. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The angel of the Lord sought to preserve Balaam from the destruction which threatened him, by standing in his way; but he did not see him, though his ass did. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1504;&#1496;&#1514;&#1492; &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, "perhaps it turned out before me; for otherwise I should surely have killed thee, and let her live." The first clause is to be regarded, as Hengstenberg supposes, as an aposiopesis. The angel does not state positively what was the reason why perhaps the ass had turned out of the way: he merely hints at it lightly, and leaves it to Balaam to gather from the hint, that the faithful animal had turned away from affection to its master, with a dim foreboding of the danger which threatened him, and yet for that very reason, as it were as a reward for its service of love, had been ill-treated by him. The traditional rendering, "if the ass had not turned aside, surely," etc., cannot be defended according to the rules of the language; and there is not sufficient ground for any such alteration of the text as Knobel suggests, viz., into &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;. These words made an impression, and Balaam made this acknowledgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-34.htm">Numbers 22:34</a>): "I have sinned, for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me; and now, if it displease thee, I will get me back again." The angel of the Lord replied, however (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-35.htm">Numbers 22:35</a>): "Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that shalt you speak." This was sufficient to show him, that it was not the journey in itself that was displeasing to God, but the feelings and intentions with which he had entered upon it. The whole procedure was intended to sharpen his conscience and sober his mind, that he might pay attention to the word which the Lord would speak to him. At the same time the impression which the appearance and words of the angel of the Lord made upon his heart, enveloped in mist as it was by the thirst for gold and honour, was not a deep one, nor one that led him to a thorough knowledge of his own heart; otherwise, after such a warning, he would never have continued his journey. </body></html>
