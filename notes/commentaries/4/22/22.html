The holy angels oppose sin, and perhaps are employed in preventing it more than we are aware. This angel was an adversary to Balaam, because Balaam counted him his adversary; those are really our best friends, and we ought so to reckon them, who stop our progress in sinful ways. Balaam has notice of God's displeasure by the ass. It is common for those whose hearts are fully set in them to do evil, to push on violently, through the difficulties Providence lays in their way. The Lord opened the mouth of the ass. This was a great miracle wrought by the power of God. He who made man speak, could, when he pleased, make the ass to speak with man's voice. The ass complained of Balaam's cruelty. The righteous God does not allow the meanest or weakest to be abused; but they shall be able to speak in their own defence, or he will some way or other speak for them. Balaam at length has his eyes opened. God has many ways to bring down the hard and unhumbled heart. When our eyes are opened, we shall see the danger of sinful ways, and how much it was for our advantage to be crossed. Balaam seemed to relent; I have sinned; but it does not appear that he was sensible of this wickedness of his heart, or willing to own it. If he finds he cannot go forward, he will be content, since there is no remedy, to go back. Thus many leave their sins, only because their sins have left them. The angel declared that he should not only be unable to curse Israel, but should be forced to bless them: this would be more for the glory of God, and to his own confusion, than if he had turned back.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The angel - i. e., the Angel that led the Israelites through the wilderness (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-16.htm">Numbers 20:16</a> and references), and subsequently appeared as the Captain of the Lord's host to Joshua Jos 6:13. In desiring to curse Israel, Balaam was fighting against Israel's Leader.

Though he had given him leave to go; but then it was upon condition that the princes called him to go with them, whereas he went without their call, and did not wait for it; and besides, he did not acquaint them, as he did not the messengers before, of what God had said, that he should not curse Israel, nor say anything contrary to this his will, which, had he told them, they would not have taken him with them; moreover, he went with an intention, with a good will to curse Israel, which must be displeasing to God, who knew his heart; so the Targum of Jonathan,"and the anger of the Lord was strong, because he went to curse them;''likewise, though he had a permission to go, it was in an angry manner, and was not agreeable to the Lord he should go, and therefore should not have gone notwithstanding; or, at least, he might expect some marks of the divine displeasure; so Jarchi observes, he saw that the thing was evil in the eyes of the Lord, or displeasing to him, and yet he desired it; just as the people of Israel, when the Lord bid them go up and possess the land, which case Aben Ezra instances in; they desired persons might be sent before hand to spy out the land, which, though permitted, they smarted for it: for not whatsoever God permits is well pleasing to him; besides, the words may be rendered (h), "when he went", or, "as he was going"; and so not a reason of the Lord's anger, but expresses when it was kindled or broke forth: <p>and the angel of the Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him; that this was not a created angel, one of the ministering spirits, but the eternal one, the angel of Jehovah's presence, appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-35.htm">Numbers 22:35</a> that went before the people of Israel in the wilderness, not only to guide but to guard and protect them; and who was an adversary to their adversaries, and at all times stood up for their help and assistance against all those that hated and opposed them: Jarchi calls him an angel of mercy, who would have restrained Balaam from sinning, that he might not sin and perish, and so was rather a friend than an adversary, had he attended to him: <p>now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him; who, the Targum of Jonathan says, were Jannes and Jambres, the magicians of Egypt, of whom see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a> these only were with him, the princes of Midian on some account or another being separated from him. <p>(h)  "quum iret", Noldius, p. 403. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And God's anger was kindled because he <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him.

After God has expressly given permission for Balaam to go, His anger would be surprising, and would seem to imply a capricious change of mind, were it not for the consideration that the narrative is derived from two different sources. In <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/22-22.htm" title="And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his ass, and his two servants were with him....">Numbers 22:22-34</a></span> Balaam travels on an ass, accompanied not by the great retinue of Moabite princes but simply by two of his own servants. The verses are from J , who relates that Balaam lived in the Ammonite country, some 40 miles distant, and the journey was made through cultivated land with vineyards and walls. See note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-5.htm" title="He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:">Numbers 22:5</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">an adversary</span>] Heb. ‘a <span class="ital">satan</span>.’ In early days a catastrophe or trouble, no less than a favour or blessing, was understood to be due to the action of God; so that here Jehovah Himself, in the form of His angel, was Balaam’s adversary. That is to say, the divine action was personified. The result of this personification is that the Angel, for the most part, appears to be distinguished from Jehovah Himself. But see <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-35.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.">Numbers 22:35</a></span>, where the Angel utters Jehovah’s own words. In later times such personifications became more definitely distinguished from God Himself, so that troubles and temptations were attributed to a malevolent spirit, who was hostile to God and men, and for whom ‘Satan’ became a recognised title. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-1.htm" title="And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.">2 Samuel 24:1</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm" title="And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>; and see G. A. Smith, <span class="ital">The Book of the Twelve Prophets</span>, pp. 410–19.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">22–34</span>. Jehovah was angry with Balaam for going, and His ‘Angel’ hindered him on the way.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And God's anger was kindled because he went,</span> or, "that he was going." <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>.

There can be no question that the ordinary translation is fight, and that God was angry with Balaam for going at all on such an errand. It is true that God had given him permission to go, but that very permission was a judicial act whereby God punished the covetous and disobedient longings of Balaam in allowing him to have his own way. God's anger is kindled by sin, and it was not less truly sin which prompted Balaam to go because he had succeeded in obtaining formal leave to go. <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">angel of the Lord stood in the way.</span> The same angel of the covenant apparently of whom Moses had spoken to the Edomites (see on Numbers 20:16). <span class="cmt_word">For an adversary against him.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>.

As a genuine heathen, who saw nothing more in the God of Israel than a national god of that people, he thought that it would be possible to render not only men, but gods also, favourable to his purpose, by means of splendid honours and rich rewards.<p>(Note: Compare the following remarks of Pliny (h. n. xxviii. 4) concerning this belief among the Romans: "Verrius Flaccus auctores ponit, quibus credat, in oppugnationibus ante omnia solitum a Romanis sacerdotibus evocari Deum, cujus in tutela id oppidum esset, promittique illi eundem aut ampliorem apud Romanos cultum. Et durat in Pontificum disciplina id sacrum, constatque ideo occultatum, in cujus Dei tutela Roma esset, ne qui hostium simili modo agerent;" - and the further explanations of this heathen notion in Hengstenberg's Balaam and his Prophecies.)</body></html>
