True religion begins with the knowledge of the holy law of God, and humiliation for sin, but we must go on towards perfection, in acquaintance with Christ and his gospel, and those effectual encouragements, motives, and assistances to holiness, which it proposes. They took their journey according to the commandment of the Lord, De 1:6-8, and as the cloud led them. Those who give themselves to the direction of God's word and Spirit, steer a steady course, even when they seem bewildered. While they are sure they cannot lose their God and Guide, they need not fear losing their way. They went out of the wilderness of Sinai, and rested in the wilderness of Paran. All our removes in this world are but from one wilderness to another. The changes we think will be for the better do not always prove so. We shall never be at rest, never at home, till we come to heaven, but all will be well there.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A more precise determination of the method of executing the order given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a>. The appointed place of the tabernacle, in the midst of the host, was represented during the march by the ark, the holy vessels, etc. carried by the Kohathites. The actual structure of the tabernacle was borne in advance by the Gershonites and Merarites, immediately behind the camp of Judah; so as to be set up ready against the arrival of the sacred utensils borne by the Kohathites.

The marching order is described (Nu 2:1-34); but, as the vast horde is represented here in actual migration, let us notice the extraordinary care that was taken for ensuring the safe conveyance of the holy things. In the rear of Judah, which, with the tribes of Issachar and Zebulun, led the van, followed the Gershonites and Merarites with the heavy and coarser materials of the tabernacle. Next in order were set in motion the flank divisions of Reuben and Ephraim. Then came the Kohathites, who occupied the center of the moving mass, bearing the sacred utensils on their shoulder. They were so far behind the other portions of the Levitical body that these would have time at the new encampment to rear the framework of the tabernacle before the Kohathites arrived. Last of all, Dan, with the associated tribes, brought up the rear of the immense caravan. Each tribe was marshalled under its prince or chief and in all their movements rallied around its own standard.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.

First of all (lit., "at the beginning") the banner of Judah drew out, with Issachar and Zebulun (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-14.htm">Numbers 10:14-16</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3-9</a>). The tabernacle was then taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites broke up, carrying those portions of its which were assigned to them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-17.htm">Numbers 10:17</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24</a>., and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-31.htm">Numbers 4:31</a>.), that they might set up the dwelling at the place to be chosen for the next encampment, before the Kohathites arrived with the sacred things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>). The banner of Reuben followed next with Simeon and Gad (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/10-18.htm">Numbers 10:18-21</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/2-10.htm">Numbers 2:10-16</a>), and the Kohathites joined them bearing the sacred things (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>). &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; ( equals  &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7-9.htm">Numbers 7:9</a>, and &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>) signifies the sacred things mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-31.htm">Numbers 3:31</a>.
