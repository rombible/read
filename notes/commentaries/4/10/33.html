The obvious objection to this supposition arising out of the fact that the cloud which directed the march rested upon, or over, the ark may be overcome by the consideration that the cloud appears to have extended over the whole of the host during the journeys, and to have served as a protection from the scorching heat (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-34.htm" title="And the cloud of the LORD was on them by day, when they went out of the camp.">Numbers 10:34</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-12.htm" title="Moreover you led them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.">Nehemiah 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm" title="He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.">Psalm 105:39</a>). On the other hand, the natural interpretation of this verse is that the ark was borne in front of the host, and did not merely serve to direct its line of march as a general, whose station might be in any part of an army. This interpretation is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm" title="And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:">Exodus 13:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-33.htm" title="Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in a cloud by day.">Deuteronomy 1:33</a>, and also by the position which the ark occupied at the passage of the Jordan.

Here is Moses's prayer when the ark set forward, Rise up, and let thine enemies be scattered. There are those in the world who are enemies to God and haters of him; secret and open enemies; enemies to his truths, his laws, his ordinances, his people. But for the scattering and defeating of God's enemies, there needs no more than God's arising. Observe also the prayer of Moses when the ark rested, that God would cause his people to rest. The welfare and happiness of the Israel of God, consist in the continual presence of God among them. Their safety is not in their numbers, but in the favour of God, and his gracious return to them, and resting with them. Upon this account, Happy art thou, O Israel! who is like unto thee, O people! God will go before them, to find them resting-places by the way. His promise is, and their prayers are, that he will never leave them nor forsake them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Three days' journey - Probably a technical expression for such a distance as could not be traversed in a single day, and therefore not without intervals of encampment and due provision: compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-36.htm">Genesis 30:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm">Exodus 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-27.htm">Exodus 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>.

Hence, the words "went before them" do not here imply local precedence. The phrase, or its equivalent, is used of a leader going out in command of his troops, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-3.htm">Deuteronomy 31:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-10.htm">2 Chronicles 1:10</a>; and similarly the ark may well be said to have gone at the head of the Israelites, when it was borne solemnly in the midst of them as the outward embodiment of the presence whose sovereign word was their law.<p>A resting place - literally, "rest." It is commonly understood of each successive encampment; or, in particular, of the first encampment. Yet the term would hardly be here employed, did it not carry with it a higher meaning, pointing to the promised rest of Canaan, for which the Israelites were now in full march, and from the speedy enjoyment of which no sentence of exclusion as yet debarred them.

The Targum of Jonathan expressly says, they went thirty six miles on that day; but, according to Bunting (o), Taberah or Kibrothhattaavah, to which the children of Israel first came, and where they abode a month, was but eight miles from Sinai; wherefore the three days' journey were not successively one after another, but the first day's journey was to Taberah, where they continued a month; the second day's journey was to Hazeroth, where they stayed seven days; and the third day's journey was to the wilderness of Paran, and there the cloud rested, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>; and there was their resting place, for there they continued long, from whence the spies were sent to the good land, and whither they returned after forty days, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-1.htm">Numbers 13:1</a>, <p>and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them;

wherefore Aben Ezra thinks, that this three days' journey was different from all their other journeys; and that in this the ark went before them, which in other journeys was carried in the midst of them; yet others think it may be said to go before, though in the middle; just as a general of an army may be said to go before, and lead his army, though he is not directly in the front of it; so the cloud being always over the ark, directing the march, it may be said to go before and point out a convenient place to rest in; for searching cannot be properly ascribed to the ark, nor even to the Lord himself, and can only signify pointing out or discovering a proper place to take up their abode in: this ark of the covenant, so called because the covenant or law was laid up in it, was a type of Christ the end of the law for righteousness, and who is the forerunner of his people, is gone before them to prepare a place for them; and the three days' journey may have respect to his resurrection from the dead on the third day for their justification, which is the foundation of their rest, peace, and joy. <p>(o) Travels of the Patriarchs, &amp;c. p. 82. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they departed from the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them.</span><p>(n) Mount Sinai, or Horeb.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">33</span>. <span class="ital">three days’ journey</span>] A characteristic expression of J ;

It was one of the supreme moments in the life of Israel - one of those beginnings or "departures" which lead to untold gain or loss; it was, in fact, although they knew it not, the commencement of a march which for almost all of them should know no end except within a hasty grave. No doubt, during the months spent at Sinai, <span class="accented">every</span> preparation had been made for the onward journey; but none the less it was a stupendous enterprise to march that vast host, so largely composed of women and children, so little inured to such fatigue, and so impatient of such discipline, for three consecutive days into a wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">Three days' journey.</span> This expression is apparently a general <span class="accented">one</span>, and not to be strictly pressed (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-36.htm">Genesis 30:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>). At the same time it implies <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the host twice halted for the night during the journey, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the whole journey was regarded as one and in some sense as complete in itself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span> of this three days' journey is given us in verse 12; it was to take them across the intervening belt of sand, and to land them fairly within the "wilderness of Paran." During this journey no doubt the march would be pushed on as steadily as possible, but it is not likely that it would cover so much as thirty miles. A modern army, unencumbered with non-combatants, does not make more than ten miles a day over difficult country, nor can cattle be driven faster than that. Even to accomplish that rate, and to <span class="accented">keep</span> the whole multitude together, as the narrative implies, required supernatural aid and strength. For the direction of the march see notes on chapter 13. <span class="cmt_word">The ark</span> <span class="cmt_word">of the covenant of the Lord went before them.</span> It is obvious that what is apparently affirmed here is apparently at variance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a> and verse 21 of this chapter, which speak of the holy things - of which the ark was the most holy - as carried by the Kohathites in the very midst of the long line of march. Three opinions have been held on the subject. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the ark was really carried with the other "holy things," and only "went before" metaphorically, as a general may be said to lead his troops, although he may not be actually in front of them; to which it is obvious <span class="cmt_word">to</span> reply that if the ark did not actually precede the host, there was no possible way in which it could direct their movements; the cloud alone would be the visible expression of the Divine guidance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the "holy things" generally were ordered to be carried in the midst of the host by the Kohathites, but that God reserved the place of the ark itself to his own immediate disposition. A general does not include himself in his own marching orders, however minute; and the ark was the outward symbol of God's own personal presence and guidance. It is, therefore, not at all surprising that the first intimation of the position of the ark on the march should be given at the moment when the march actually commenced. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That the usual place for the ark was no doubt with the sanctuary, as implied in the orders, but that o a <span class="accented">this special occasion</span> the ark went to the front in consequence of some Divine intimation, just as it did at the crossing of Jordan and at the taking of Jericho. Certainly there is much reason in this view, considering how momentous and formidable was their first assay at marching from their temporary home towards that unknown land beyond the northern horizon. If the deep waters of Jordan might fright them, or the walls of Jericho defy them, well might they shrink from plunging into the broken, stony, and intractable country into which the ark and the cloud now led them. We shall probably think that either habitually or at least occasionally the ark <span class="accented">did</span> go before, and that the feet of them that bare it were supernaturally directed, either by the movements of the cloud, or by some more secret intimation, towards the destined place of rest. It is allowed by all that the cloud preceded and directed the march, and it would be strange indeed if these twin symbols of the Divine presence had been so far separated from one another; for the accustomed place of the cloud was above the tabernacle, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, above the ark, yet outside of the tabernacle, so as to be visible to all. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Behind the sacred things came the banners of Ephraim, with Manasseh and Benjamin (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/2-18.htm">Numbers 2:18-24</a>), and Dan with Asher and Naphtali (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/2-25.htm">Numbers 2:25-31</a>); so that the camp of Dan was the "collector of all the camps according to their hosts," i.e., formed that division of the army which kept the hosts together. </body></html>
