Here is Moses's prayer when the ark set forward, Rise up, and let thine enemies be scattered. There are those in the world who are enemies to God and haters of him; secret and open enemies; enemies to his truths, his laws, his ordinances, his people. But for the scattering and defeating of God's enemies, there needs no more than God's arising. Observe also the prayer of Moses when the ark rested, that God would cause his people to rest. The welfare and happiness of the Israel of God, consist in the continual presence of God among them. Their safety is not in their numbers, but in the favour of God, and his gracious return to them, and resting with them. Upon this account, Happy art thou, O Israel! who is like unto thee, O people! God will go before them, to find them resting-places by the way. His promise is, and their prayers are, that he will never leave them nor forsake them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Three days' journey - Probably a technical expression for such a distance as could not be traversed in a single day, and therefore not without intervals of encampment and due provision: compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/30-36.htm">Genesis 30:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-18.htm">Exodus 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-3.htm">Exodus 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-27.htm">Exodus 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>. The technical use of the phrase "Sabbath-day's journey" for another average distance, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>, is similar.<p>The ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them - From <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a> it would appear that the usual place of the ark during the march was in the midst of the host. It was evidently an exceptional case when, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>, the ark preceded the people into the bed of the Jordan. Hence, the words "went before them" do not here imply local precedence. The phrase, or its equivalent, is used of a leader going out in command of his troops, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-3.htm">Deuteronomy 31:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-10.htm">2 Chronicles 1:10</a>; and similarly the ark may well be said to have gone at the head of the Israelites, when it was borne solemnly in the midst of them as the outward embodiment of the presence whose sovereign word was their law.<p>A resting place - literally, "rest." It is commonly understood of each successive encampment; or, in particular, of the first encampment. Yet the term would hardly be here employed, did it not carry with it a higher meaning, pointing to the promised rest of Canaan, for which the Israelites were now in full march, and from the speedy enjoyment of which no sentence of exclusion as yet debarred them.

But it is probable that the cloudy pillar, which, while stationary, rested upon the ark, preceded them in the march&#8212;as, when in motion at one time (Ex 14:19) it is expressly said to have shifted its place.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> And by night too, as was expressed before.

To what extent the people at large were able to enjoy this shade amidst the burning heats of the desert we cannot possibly tell, but there is no doubt that it dwelt in the memory of the nation, and gave meaning to such expressions as the "shadow of the Almighty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>), and "the shadow of a cloud" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4, 5</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Behind the sacred things came the banners of Ephraim, with Manasseh and Benjamin (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/2-18.htm">Numbers 2:18-24</a>), and Dan with Asher and Naphtali (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/2-25.htm">Numbers 2:25-31</a>); so that the camp of Dan was the "collector of all the camps according to their hosts," i.e., formed that division of the army which kept the hosts together. </body></html>
