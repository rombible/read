It was a token of God's gracious presence. Yet they were to pitch their tents afar off, in reverence to the sanctuary. The children of Israel put themselves in their posts, without murmuring or disputing; and as it was their safety, so it was their beauty. It is our duty and interest to be contented with the place allotted to us, and to endeavour to occupy it in a proper manner, without envying or murmuring; without ambition or covetousness. Thus the gospel church ought to be compact, according to the Scripture model, every one knowing and keeping his place; and then all that wish well to the church rejoice, beholding their order, Col 2:5.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The following plan shows the general arrangement of the camp, which would vary in different places according to local exigencies.

The general direction indeed of their march was northwards, not eastwards; but nothing can obliterate the natural pre-eminence given to the east by the sunrise, the scattering of light upon the earth, the daily symbol of the day-spring from on high. <span class="cmt_word">The standard of the camp of Judah.</span> Judah led the way not because he was the greatest in number, for the order of the tribes was not determined by this consideration, but because of his place in prophecy, and as the ancestor of the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). According to Aben Ezra and other Jewish expositors, the device upon the standard of Judah was a young lion, and this agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>. The same authorities assign to Reuben a man, to Ephraim an ox (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>), to Dan an eagle. If it were so, we should find in these banners the origin of the forms of the living creatures in the visions of Ezekiel and St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4-6</a>), unless, indeed, the devices on the standards were themselves taken from the symbolic forms of the cherubim in the tabernacle, and these in their turn borrowed from the religious art of Egypt. But the tradition of the Jews is too fluctuating to carry any weight. The Targum of Palestine assigns to Judea the lion, but to Reuben a stag, to Ephraim a young man, and to Dan a basilisk serpent. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses was not to muster the tribe of Levi along with the children of Israel, i.e., with the other tribes, or take their number, but to appoint the Levites for the service of the dwelling of the testimony (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-21.htm">Exodus 38:21</a>), i.e., of the tabernacle, that they might encamp around it, might take it down when the camp was broken up, and set it up when Israel encamped again, and that no stranger (zar, non-Levite, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-10.htm">Leviticus 22:10</a>) might come near it and be put to death (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>).
