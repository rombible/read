Though Canaan itself was a pleasant land, as it is termed <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-9.htm" title="And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.">Daniel 8:9</a>, yet it butted upon wildernesses and seas, and was surrounded with divers melancholy prospects. And thus the vineyard of the church is compassed on all hands with the desert of this world, which serves as a foil to it, to make it appear the more amiable and desirable. Many of the borders of Canaan, however, were its defences and fortifications, and rendered the access of its enemies more difficult. <span class="ital">The utmost coast of the salt sea — </span>So called from the salt and sulphureous taste of its waters; and termed also the <span class="ital">Dead sea, </span>because no creature, it appears, will live in it, on account of its excessive saltness, or rather bituminous quality. “It contains,” says Volney, “neither animal nor vegetable life. We see no verdure on its banks, nor are fish to be found within its waters.” This was part of the border of the Israelites, that it might be a constant warning to them to take heed of those sins which had been the ruin of Sodom: yet the iniquity of Sodom was afterward found in Israel; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm" title="Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.">Ezekiel 16:49</a>;) for which Canaan was made, though not a salt sea, as Sodom, yet a barren soil, and continues such to this day. <span class="ital">Eastward — </span>That is, at the eastern part of that sea, where the eastern and southern borders of the land met. Thus Moses determines the boundary of Canaan, on the south, to be Idumaea and the deserts of Arabia.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:1-15 Canaan was of small extent; as it is here bounded, it is but about 160 miles in length, and about 50 in breadth; yet this was the country promised to the father of the faithful, and the possession of the seed of Israel. This was that little spot of ground, in which alone, for many ages, God was known. This was the vineyard of the Lord, the garden enclosed; but as it is with gardens and vineyards, the narrowness of the space was made up by the fruitfulness of the soil. Though the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, yet few know him, and serve him; but those few are happy, because fruitful to God. Also, see how little a share of the world God gives to his own people. Those who have their portion in heaven, have reason to be content with a small pittance of this earth. Yet a little that a righteous man has, having it from the love of God, and with his blessing, is far better and more comfortable than the riches of many wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The southern boundary commenced at the Dead Sea. The broad and desolate valley by which the depressed bed of that sea is protected toward the south, is called the Ghor. A deep narrow glen enters it at its southwest corner; it is called Wady-el-Fikreh, and is continued in the same southwestern direction, under the name of Wady el-Marrah; a wady which loses itself among the hills belonging to "the wilderness of Zin;" and Kadesh-barnea (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a> note), which is "in the wilderness of Zin," will be, as the text implies, the southernmost point of the southern boundary. Thence, if Kadesh be identical with the present Ain el-Weibeh, westward to the river, or brook of Egypt, now Wady el-Arish, is a distance of about seventy miles. In this interval were Hazar-addar and Azmon; the former being perhaps the general name of a district of Hazerim, or nomad hamlets (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>), of which Adder was one: and Azmon, perhaps to be identified with Kesam, the modern Kasaimeh, a group of springs situate in the north of one of the gaps in the ridge, and a short distance west of Ain el-Kudeirat.<p>(Others consider the boundary line to have followed the Ghor along the Arabah to the south of the Azazimeh mountains, thence to Gadis round the southeast of that mountain, and thence to Wady el-Arish.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-5. your south quarter&#8212;The line which bounded it on the south is the most difficult to trace. According to the best biblical geographers, the leading points here defined are as follows: The southwest angle of the southern boundary should be where the wilderness of Zin touches the border of Edom, so that the southern boundary should extend eastward from the extremity of the Dead Sea, wind around the precipitous ridge of Akrabbim ("scorpions"), thought to be the high and difficult Pass of Safeh, which crosses the stream that flows from the south into the Jordan&#8212;that is, the great valley of the Arabah, reaching from the Dead to the Red Sea.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The south quarter</span> is here described from east to west by divers windings and turnings, by reason of the mountains, rivers, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By the coast of Edom, </span> bordering all along upon the Edomites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Salt Sea, </span> so called from the salt and sulphurous taste of its waters. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Eastward, </span> i.e. at the eastern part of that sea, where the eastern and southern borders meet. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then your south quarter,....

The wilderness of gin can scarcely be anything else than the Wady Murreh, with more or less of the barren hills which rise to the south of it, for this wady undoubtedly forms the natural southern boundary of Canaan. All travelers agree both as to the remarkable character of the depression itself and as to the contrast between its northern and southern mountain walls. To the south lies the inhospitable and un-cultivatable desert; to the north the often arid and treeless, but still partially green and habitable, plateau of Southern Palestine. The expression, "on the sides of Edom," can only mean that beyond the Wady Murreh lay territory belonging to Edom, the Mount Seir of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>, the Seir of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>; it does not seem possible that Edom proper, which lay to the east of the Arabah, and which barely marched at all with the land of Canaan, should be intended here (see on Joshua 15:1, and the note on the site of Kadesh). <span class="cmt_word">And your south border.</span> This begins a fresh paragraph, in which the southern boundary, already roughly fixed, is described in greater detail. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be</span> <span class="cmt_word">the utmost coast of the salt sea eastward.</span> Rather, "shall be from the extremity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>) of the salt sea eastward" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-2.htm">Joshua 15:2</a>).
