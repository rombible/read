The southern boundary which is here described is the same as that of the tribe of Judah, as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/15-1.htm" title="This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.">Joshua 15:1-2</a>. The land of the Israelites was to extend towards the south as far as the wilderness of Zin, which was to divide their territory from that of the Edomites.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:1-15 Canaan was of small extent; as it is here bounded, it is but about 160 miles in length, and about 50 in breadth; yet this was the country promised to the father of the faithful, and the possession of the seed of Israel. This was that little spot of ground, in which alone, for many ages, God was known. This was the vineyard of the Lord, the garden enclosed; but as it is with gardens and vineyards, the narrowness of the space was made up by the fruitfulness of the soil. Though the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, yet few know him, and serve him; but those few are happy, because fruitful to God. Also, see how little a share of the world God gives to his own people. Those who have their portion in heaven, have reason to be content with a small pittance of this earth. Yet a little that a righteous man has, having it from the love of God, and with his blessing, is far better and more comfortable than the riches of many wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The land of Canaan - The name Canaan is here restricted to the territory west of the Jordan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. this is the &#8230; land of Canaan&#8212;The details given in this chapter mark the general boundary of the inheritance of Israel west of the Jordan.
