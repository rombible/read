This was that little spot of ground, in which alone, for many ages, God was known. This was the vineyard of the Lord, the garden enclosed; but as it is with gardens and vineyards, the narrowness of the space was made up by the fruitfulness of the soil. Though the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, yet few know him, and serve him; but those few are happy, because fruitful to God. Also, see how little a share of the world God gives to his own people. Those who have their portion in heaven, have reason to be content with a small pittance of this earth. Yet a little that a righteous man has, having it from the love of God, and with his blessing, is far better and more comfortable than the riches of many wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The southern boundary commenced at the Dead Sea. The broad and desolate valley by which the depressed bed of that sea is protected toward the south, is called the Ghor. A deep narrow glen enters it at its southwest corner; it is called Wady-el-Fikreh, and is continued in the same southwestern direction, under the name of Wady el-Marrah; a wady which loses itself among the hills belonging to "the wilderness of Zin;" and Kadesh-barnea (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a> note), which is "in the wilderness of Zin," will be, as the text implies, the southernmost point of the southern boundary. Thence, if Kadesh be identical with the present Ain el-Weibeh, westward to the river, or brook of Egypt, now Wady el-Arish, is a distance of about seventy miles. In this interval were Hazar-addar and Azmon; the former being perhaps the general name of a district of Hazerim, or nomad hamlets (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>), of which Adder was one: and Azmon, perhaps to be identified with Kesam, the modern Kasaimeh, a group of springs situate in the north of one of the gaps in the ridge, and a short distance west of Ain el-Kudeirat.<p>(Others consider the boundary line to have followed the Ghor along the Arabah to the south of the Azazimeh mountains, thence to Gadis round the southeast of that mountain, and thence to Wady el-Arish.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. river of Egypt&#8212;the ancient brook Sihor, the Rhinocolura of the Greeks, a little to the south of El-Arish, where this wady gently descends towards the Mediterranean (Jos 13:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The river of Egypt, </span> called <span class="ital">Sihor</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm" title="From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even to the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:">Joshua 13:3</a></span>, which divided Egypt from Canaan.

It was a winter torrent which drained the greater part of the western half of the northern desert of the Sinaitic peninsula. It was, however, only in its lower course, where a single channel receives the intermittent outflow of many wadys, that it was known as the "brook of Egypt," because it formed the well-marked boundary between Egypt and Canaan (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>, where the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, from the name of the frontier fort, Rhinocorura, afterwards built there). So far as we are able to follow  the line drawn in these verses, it would appear to have held a course somewhat to the south of west for about half its length, then to have made a southerly deflection to Kadesh, and from thence to have struck north-west until it reached the sea, almost in the same latitude as the point from which it started. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The command to divide the land by lot among the families is partly a verbal repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-53.htm">Numbers 26:53-56</a>. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1500;&#1493; &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;: literally, "into that, whither the lot comes out to him, shall be to him" (i.e., to each family); in other words, it is to receive that portion of land to which the lot that comes out of the urn shall point it.
