The order in which the tribes are named is peculiar to this passage. If they be taken in pairs, Judah and Simeon, Benjamin and Dan, Manasseh and Ephraim, Zebulun and Issachar, Asher and Naphtali, the order of the pairs agrees with the order in which the allotments in the Holy land, taken also in couples, followed each other in the map from south to north. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-29. names of the men &#8230; which shall divide the land&#8212;This appointment by the Lord before the Jordan tended not only to animate the Israelites faith in the certainty of the conquest, but to prevent all subsequent dispute and discontent, which might have been dangerous in presence of the natives. The nominees were ten princes for the nine and a half tribes, one of them being selected from the western section of Manasseh, and all subordinate to the great military and ecclesiastical chiefs, Joshua and Eleazar. The names are mentioned in the exact order in which the tribes obtained possession of the land, and according to brotherly connection.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Eleazar</span> was to act in God’s name, to cast lots, to prevent differences and contentions, to consult with God in cases of difficulty, to transact the whole business in a solemn and religious manner. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you,....

The article &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;, and still more the precise description, "to the east of Ain, the fountain, or fountain locality" (Knobel), show plainly that this Riblah is to be distinguished from the Riblah in the land of Hamath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-21.htm">2 Kings 25:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-9.htm">Jeremiah 39:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-27.htm">Jeremiah 52:27</a>), with which it is mostly identified. Ain is supposed to be "the great fountain of Neba Anjar, at the foot of Antilibanus, which is often called Birket Anjar, on account of its taking its rise in a small reservoir or pool" (Robinson, Bibl. Res. p. 498), and near to which Mej-del-Anjar is to be seen, consisting of "the ruins of the walls and towers of a fortified town, or rather of a large citadel" (Robinson, p. 496; cf. Ritter, xvii. pp. 181ff.).<p>(Note: Knobel regards Ain as the source of the Orontes, i.e., Neba Lebweh, and yet, notwithstanding this, identifies Riblah with the village of Ribleh mentioned above. But can this Ribleh, which is at least eight hours to the north of Neba Lebweh, be described as on the east of Ain, i.e., Neba Lebweh?)<p>From this point the boundary went farther down, and pressed (&#1502;&#1495;&#1492;) "upon the shoulder of the lake of Chinnereth towards the east," i.e., upon the north-east shore of the Sea of Galilee (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35</a>). Hence it ran down along the Jordan to the Salt Sea (Dead Sea). According to these statements, therefore, the eastern boundary went from Bekaa along the western slopes of Antilibanus, over or past Rasbeya and Banyas, at the foot of Hermon, along the edge of the mountains which bound the Huleh basin towards the east, down to the north-east corner of the Sea of Galilee; so that Hermon itself (Jebel es Sheikh) did not belong to the land of Israel. </body></html>
