What is here called the height of Akrabbim is supposed to be a row of white cliffs, which run obliquely across the Arabah, at a distance of about eight miles from the Dead Sea.

This was that little spot of ground, in which alone, for many ages, God was known. This was the vineyard of the Lord, the garden enclosed; but as it is with gardens and vineyards, the narrowness of the space was made up by the fruitfulness of the soil. Though the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, yet few know him, and serve him; but those few are happy, because fruitful to God. Also, see how little a share of the world God gives to his own people. Those who have their portion in heaven, have reason to be content with a small pittance of this earth. Yet a little that a righteous man has, having it from the love of God, and with his blessing, is far better and more comfortable than the riches of many wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The southern boundary commenced at the Dead Sea. The broad and desolate valley by which the depressed bed of that sea is protected toward the south, is called the Ghor. A deep narrow glen enters it at its southwest corner; it is called Wady-el-Fikreh, and is continued in the same southwestern direction, under the name of Wady el-Marrah; a wady which loses itself among the hills belonging to "the wilderness of Zin;" and Kadesh-barnea (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a> note), which is "in the wilderness of Zin," will be, as the text implies, the southernmost point of the southern boundary. Thence, if Kadesh be identical with the present Ain el-Weibeh, westward to the river, or brook of Egypt, now Wady el-Arish, is a distance of about seventy miles. In this interval were Hazar-addar and Azmon; the former being perhaps the general name of a district of Hazerim, or nomad hamlets (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>), of which Adder was one: and Azmon, perhaps to be identified with Kesam, the modern Kasaimeh, a group of springs situate in the north of one of the gaps in the ridge, and a short distance west of Ain el-Kudeirat.<p>(Others consider the boundary line to have followed the Ghor along the Arabah to the south of the Azazimeh mountains, thence to Gadis round the southeast of that mountain, and thence to Wady el-Arish.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3-5. your south quarter&#8212;The line which bounded it on the south is the most difficult to trace. According to the best biblical geographers, the leading points here defined are as follows: The southwest angle of the southern boundary should be where the wilderness of Zin touches the border of Edom, so that the southern boundary should extend eastward from the extremity of the Dead Sea, wind around the precipitous ridge of Akrabbim ("scorpions"), thought to be the high and difficult Pass of Safeh, which crosses the stream that flows from the south into the Jordan&#8212;that is, the great valley of the Arabah, reaching from the Dead to the Red Sea.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Akrabbim, </span> called <span class="ital">Maaleh-acrabbim</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-3.htm" title="And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side to Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:">Joshua 15:3</a></span>, which was at the south end of the Salt or Dead Sea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From the south, </span> or, <span class="ital">on the south</span>, i.e. proceeding onward towards the south. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Kadesh-barnea</span> was on the southern part of Canaan, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-17.htm" title="And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:">Numbers 13:17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hazar-addar, </span> in <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-3.htm" title="And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side to Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:">Joshua 15:3</a></span>, may seem distinguished into two places, Hezron and Adar, which here are united, because peradventure they were contiguous, or joined together.

The ascent of ‘Aḳrabbim may be sought in one of the passes on the N. side of the Wady el-Fiḳreh, and perhaps in particular in the Naḳb el-Yemen, which starts just opposite the Jebel Madurah, or in the Naḳb eṣ-Ṣafâ’ (Gray).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall turn from</span> <span class="cmt_word">the south to the ascent of Akrabbim.</span> It is not at all clear what <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> can mean in this sentence. The A.V., which follows the Septuagint and the Targums, does not seem to give any sense, while the rendering, "to the south side of the ascent," does not seem grammatically defensible. Moreover, it is quite uncertain where the "ascent of Akrabbim," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the "Scorpion-pass," or "Scorpion-stairs," is to be placed. Some travelers have recognized both place and name in a precipitous road which ascends the northern cliffs towards the western end of the Wady Murreh, and which the Arabs call Nakb Kareb; others would make the ascent to be the steep pass of es Sufah, over which runs the road from Petra to Hebron; others, again, identify the Scorpion-stairs with the row of white cliffs which obliquely cross and close in the Ghor, some miles south of the Salt Sea, and separate it from the higher level of the Arabah. None of these identifications are satisfactory, although the first and last have more to be said in their favour than the second. Possibly the ascent of Akrabbim may have been only the Wady Fikreh, along which the natural frontier would run from the point of the Salt Sea into the Wady Murreh. <span class="cmt_word">Pass on to Zin.</span> It is only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a> that the name Zin stands by itself; it may have been some place in the broadest part of the Wady Murreh which gave its name to the neighbouring wilderness.

But if Kadesh was in the neighbourhood of the present Ain Kudes, then it may be understood that the frontier, after reaching the western end of the Wady Murreh, made <span class="accented">a detour</span> to the south so as to include Kadesh, as a place of peculiarly sacred memory in the annals of Israel. It is indeed very difficult, with this description of the southern frontier of Canaan before us, to believe that Kadesh was in the immediate neighbourhood of the Arabah, where many commentators place it; for if that were the case, then the boundary line has not yet made any progress at all towards the west, and the only points given on the actual southern boundary are the two unknown places which follow. <span class="cmt_word">Hazar-addar.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a> this double name is apparently divided into the two names of Hezron and Addar, but possibly the latter only is the place intended here.
