The order in which the tribes are named is peculiar to this passage. If they be taken in pairs, Judah and Simeon, Benjamin and Dan, Manasseh and Ephraim, Zebulun and Issachar, Asher and Naphtali, the order of the pairs agrees with the order in which the allotments in the Holy land, taken also in couples, followed each other in the map from south to north. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-29. names of the men &#8230; which shall divide the land&#8212;This appointment by the Lord before the Jordan tended not only to animate the Israelites faith in the certainty of the conquest, but to prevent all subsequent dispute and discontent, which might have been dangerous in presence of the natives. The nominees were ten princes for the nine and a half tribes, one of them being selected from the western section of Manasseh, and all subordinate to the great military and ecclesiastical chiefs, Joshua and Eleazar. The names are mentioned in the exact order in which the tribes obtained possession of the land, and according to brotherly connection.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These are they whom the Lord commanded,.... Not only named and appointed them, but laid his commands upon them, and obliged them: <p>to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel; even this order was made before the land was conquered by them, so sure and certain was it unto them; and accordingly they did divide it, and that in Shiloh, before the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, as in the presence of God, doing it in the most impartial and solemn manner; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-51.htm">Joshua 19:51</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">These <i>are they</i> whom the LORD commanded to <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.</span><p>(g) And be judges over every piece of ground that should fall to any by lot, to the intent that all things might be done orderly and without contention.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>List of the Men Appointed to Distribute the Land. - In addition to Eleazar and Joshua, the former of whom was to stand at the head as high priest, in accordance with the divine appointment in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>, and the latter to occupy the second place as commander of the army, a prince was selected from each of the ten tribes who were interested in the distribution, as Reuben and Gad had nothing to do with it. Of these princes, namely heads of fathers' houses of the tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1</a>), not heads of tribes (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-2.htm">Numbers 13:2</a>), Caleb, who is well known from <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, is the only one whose name if known. The others are not mentioned anywhere else. The list of tribes, in the enumeration of their princes, corresponds, with some exceptions, to the situation of the territory which the tribes received in Canaan, reckoning from south to north, and deviates considerably from the order in which the lots came out for the different tribes, as described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15.htm">Joshua 15-19</a>. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; in the Kal, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-17.htm">Numbers 34:17</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-18.htm">Numbers 34:18</a>, signifies to give for an inheritance, just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-8.htm">Exodus 34:8</a>, to put into possession.
