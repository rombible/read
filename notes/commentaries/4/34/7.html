But, as Ritter has observed (“Comparative Geography of Palestine,” 3, p. 176), “Hermon stands too far eastward to answer the conditions of the problem,” and he thinks that some peak very near the Mediterranean must be meant. Von Raumer considers that it was probably one of the peaks belonging to the Lebanon range, and discernible from Sidon.

This was that little spot of ground, in which alone, for many ages, God was known. This was the vineyard of the Lord, the garden enclosed; but as it is with gardens and vineyards, the narrowness of the space was made up by the fruitfulness of the soil. Though the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof, yet few know him, and serve him; but those few are happy, because fruitful to God. Also, see how little a share of the world God gives to his own people. Those who have their portion in heaven, have reason to be content with a small pittance of this earth. Yet a little that a righteous man has, having it from the love of God, and with his blessing, is far better and more comfortable than the riches of many wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The northern border.

The extreme point in the northern border of the land was the city of Zedad (Sadad), about 30 miles east of the entrance of Hamath. Hence, the border turned back southwestward to Ziphron (Zifran), about 40 miles northeast of Damascus.

The Hebrew words, however, Hor-ha-Hor, properly signify "the mountain of the mountain," or "the high double mountain," which, from the situation, can mean nothing else than the mountain Amana (So 4:8), a member of the great Lebanon range (Jos 13:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Not that <span class="ital">Hor</span> where Aaron died, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-23.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,">Numbers 20:23</a></span>, which was southward, and bordering upon Edom, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-37.htm" title="And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.">Numbers 33:37</a>,38</span>, and therefore could not be their northern border; but another mountain, and, as it is conceived, the mountain of Libanus, which is elsewhere mentioned as the northern border of the land, and which, in regard of divers parts, or by divers people, is called by divers names, as <span class="ital">Sirion</span> and <span class="ital">Shenir</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm" title="(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)">Deu 3:9</a></span>, and <span class="ital">Sion</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-48.htm" title="From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even to mount Sion, which is Hermon,">Deu 4:48</a></span>, and <span class="ital">Hermon</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm" title="And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sun rise, from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath.">Joshua 13:5</a></span>, and here <span class="ital">Hor</span>, which signifies a <span class="ital">mountain</span>, and this may be called so by way of eminency.

There is, however, no reason whatever for supposing (contrary to the analogy of all such names, and of the other Mount Hor) that it included the whole range of Lebanon proper. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/34.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Boundaries of the Land of Canaan. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2</a>.
