The beginning of this law is very encouraging, When ye come into the land of your habitation which I give unto you. This was a plain intimation that God would secure the promised land to their seed. It was requisite, since the sacrifices of acknowledgment were intended as the food of God's table, that there should be a constant supply of bread, oil, and wine, whatever the flesh-meat was. And the intent of this law is to direct the proportions of the meat-offering and drink-offering. Natives and strangers are placed on a level in this as in other like matters. It was a happy forewarning of the calling of the Gentiles, and of their admission into the church. If the law made so little difference between Jew and Gentile, much less would the gospel, which broke down the partition-wall, and reconciled both to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dough - "Coarse meal" <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-37.htm">Nehemiah 10:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. heave offering of the threshing-floor&#8212;meaning the corn on the threshing-floor; that is, after harvest.<p>so shall ye heave it&#8212;to the priests accompanying the ceremony with the same rites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Of the corn in the threshing-floor, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm" title="You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine:">Deu 16:13</a></span>, when you have gathered in your corn. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So shall ye heave it, </span> i.e. you shall offer this in the same proportion, to the same persons, i.e. the priests, and with the same rites. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering,.... Of the first dough made of the first corn that was threshed, winnowed and ground, they were to make a cake, and offer it an heave offering unto the Lord; the quantity of it is not expressed, but was left to the people's generosity; no stinted measure was fixed by the law; but according to the Scribes, or the traditions of the elders, the quantity of the cake was the twenty fourth part of the first dough that was kneaded; not the forty fourth, as Buxtorf (p) through mistake says; so the Targum of Jonathan,"of the first of your dough, one out of twenty four (i.e. the twenty fourth part of it), ye shall separate a separation for the priests,''with which agrees the Misnah (q), though according to that, if made to sell publicly it was the forty eighth part of it. Some, because <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-21.htm">Numbers 15:21</a> begins and ends with  "mem", which numerically signifies "forty", think this is an instruction to a bountiful person to give the fortieth part (r): <p>as ye do the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall ye heave it; as the two wave loaves and firstfruits of their harvest, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-16.htm">Leviticus 23:16</a>. <p>(p) Synagog.
