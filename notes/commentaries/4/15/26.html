Sins committed ignorantly, shall be forgiven through Christ the great Sacrifice, who, when he offered up himself once for all upon the cross, seemed to explain one part of the intention of his offering, in that prayer, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.

As the stranger was counted as of the nation for religious purposes, he shared both in its sin and in its forgiveness. There is no record of this atonement ever having been made, although there was abundant occasion for it; it may well be that it was intended only to stand on record against the Jews, and to point them to the one true expiation for their national as well as for their particular transgressions. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"As for the assembly, there shall be one law for the Israelite and the stranger,...an eternal ordinance...before Jehovah." &#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;, which is construed absolutely, refers to the assembling of the nation before Jehovah, or to the congregation viewed in its attitude with regard to God.<p>A second law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-17.htm">Numbers 15:17-21</a>) appoints, on the ground of the general regulations in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>, the presentation of a heave-offering from the bread which they would eat in the land of Canaan, viz., a first-fruit of groat-meal (&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1514; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;) baked as cake (&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;). Arisoth, which is only used in connection with the gift of first-fruits, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a>, and the passage before us, signifies most probably groats, or meal coarsely bruised, like the talmudical &#1506;&#1512;&#1505;&#1503;, contusum, mola, far, and indeed far hordei. This cake of the groats of first-fruits they were to offer "as a heave-offering of the threshing-floor," i.e., as a heave-offering of the bruised corn, in the same manner as this (therefore, in addition to it, and along with it); and that "according to your generations" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>), that is to say, for all time, to consecrate a gift of first-fruits to the Lord, not only of the grains of corn, but also of the bread made from the corn, and "to cause a blessing to rest upon his house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>). Like all the gifts of first-fruits, this cake also fell to the portion of the priests (see Ezek. and Neh. ut sup.).<p>To these there are added, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-31.htm">Numbers 15:31</a>, laws relating to sin-offerings, the first of which, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22-26</a>, is distinguished from the case referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13-21</a>, by the fact that the sin is not described here, as it is there, as "doing one of the commandments of Jehovah which ought not to be done," but as "not doing all that Jehovah had spoken through Moses." Consequently, the allusion here is not to sins of commission, but to sins of omission, not following the law of God, "even (as is afterwards explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-23.htm">Numbers 15:23</a>) all that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses from the day that the Lord hath commanded, and thenceforward according to your generations," i.e., since the first beginning of the giving of the law, and during the whole of the time following (Knobel). These words apparently point to a complete falling away of the congregation from the whole of the law. Only the further stipulation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-24.htm">Numbers 15:24</a>, "if it occur away from the eyes of the congregation through error" (in oversight), cannot be easily reconciled with this, as it seems hardly conceivable that an apostasy from the entire law should have remained hidden from the congregation. This "not doing all the commandments of Jehovah," of which the congregation is supposed to incur the guilt without perceiving it, might consist either in the fact that, in particular instances, whether from oversight or negligence, the whole congregation omitted to fulfil the commandments of God, i.e., certain precepts of the law, sc., in the fact that they neglected the true and proper fulfilment of the whole law, either, as Outram supposes, "by retaining to a certain extent the national rites, and following the worship of the true God, and yet at the same time acting unconsciously in opposition to the law, through having been led astray by some common errors;" or by allowing the evil example of godless rulers to seduce them to neglect their religious duties, or to adopt and join in certain customs and usages of the heathen, which appeared to be reconcilable with the law of Jehovah, though they really led to contempt and neglect of the commandments of the Lord.<p>(Note: Maimonides (see Outram, ex veterum sententia) understands this law as relating to extraneous worship; and Outram himself refers to the times of the wicked kings, "when the people neglected their hereditary rites, and, forgetting the sacred laws, fell by a common sin into the observance of the religious rites of other nations." Undoubtedly, we have historical ground in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-21.htm">2 Chronicles 29:21</a>., and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>, for this interpretation of our law, but further allusions are not excluded in consequence. We cannot agree with Baumgarten, therefore, in restricting the difference between <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13</a>. and the passage before us to the fact, that the former supposes the transgression of one particular commandment on the part of the whole congregation, whilst the latter (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-23.htm">Numbers 15:23</a>) refers to a continued lawless condition on the part of Israel.)<p>But as a disregard or neglect of the commandments of God had to be expiated, a burnt-offering was to be added to the sin-offering, that the separation of the congregation from the Lord, which had arisen from the sin of omission, might be entirely removed. The apodosis commences with &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-24.htm">Numbers 15:24</a>, but is interrupted by &#1502;&#1506;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, and resumed again with &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;, "it shall be, if...the whole congregation shall prepare," etc. The burnt-offering, being the principal sacrifice, is mentioned as usual before the sin-offering, although, when presented, it followed the latter, on account of its being necessary that the sin should be expiated before the congregation could sanctify its life and efforts afresh to the Lord in the burnt-offering. "One kid of the goats:" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-16.htm">Leviticus 9:16</a>, etc.) refers to the right established in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-8.htm">Numbers 15:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-9.htm">Numbers 15:9</a>, concerning the combination of the meat and drink-offering with the burnt-offering. The sin-offering was to be treated according to the rule laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14</a>.</body></html>
