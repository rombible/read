Sins thus committed are exceedingly sinful. He that thus breaks the commandment reproaches the Lord. He also despises the word of the Lord. Presumptuous sinners despise it, thinking themselves too great, too good, and too wise, to be ruled by it. A particular instance of presumption in the sin of sabbath-breaking is related. The offence was gathering sticks on the sabbath day, to make a fire, whereas the people were to bake and seethe what they had occasion for, the day before, Ex 16:23. This was done as an affront both to the law and to the Lawgiver. God is jealous for the honour of his sabbaths, and will not hold him guiltless who profanes them, whatever men may do. God intended this punishment for a warning to all, to make conscience of keeping holy the sabbath. And we may be assured that no command was ever given for the punishment of sin, which, at the judgment day, shall not prove to have come from perfect love and justice. The right of God to a day of devotion to himself, will be disputed and denied only by such as listen to the pride and unbelief of their hearts, rather than to the teaching of the Spirit of truth and life. Wherein consists the difference between him who was detected gathering sticks in the wilderness on the day of God, and the man who turns his back upon the blessings of sabbath appointments, and the promises of sabbath mercies, to use his time, his cares, and his soul, in heaping up riches; and waste his hours, his property, and his strength in sinful pleasure? Wealth may come by the unhallowed effort, but it will not come alone; it will have its awful reward.

Arisoth, which is only used in connection with the gift of first-fruits, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a>, and the passage before us, signifies most probably groats, or meal coarsely bruised, like the talmudical &#1506;&#1512;&#1505;&#1503;, contusum, mola, far, and indeed far hordei. This cake of the groats of first-fruits they were to offer "as a heave-offering of the threshing-floor," i.e., as a heave-offering of the bruised corn, in the same manner as this (therefore, in addition to it, and along with it); and that "according to your generations" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>), that is to say, for all time, to consecrate a gift of first-fruits to the Lord, not only of the grains of corn, but also of the bread made from the corn, and "to cause a blessing to rest upon his house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>). Like all the gifts of first-fruits, this cake also fell to the portion of the priests (see Ezek. and Neh. ut sup.).<p>To these there are added, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-31.htm">Numbers 15:31</a>, laws relating to sin-offerings, the first of which, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22-26</a>, is distinguished from the case referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13-21</a>, by the fact that the sin is not described here, as it is there, as "doing one of the commandments of Jehovah which ought not to be done," but as "not doing all that Jehovah had spoken through Moses." Consequently, the allusion here is not to sins of commission, but to sins of omission, not following the law of God, "even (as is afterwards explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-23.htm">Numbers 15:23</a>) all that the Lord hath commanded you by the hand of Moses from the day that the Lord hath commanded, and thenceforward according to your generations," i.e., since the first beginning of the giving of the law, and during the whole of the time following (Knobel). These words apparently point to a complete falling away of the congregation from the whole of the law. Only the further stipulation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-24.htm">Numbers 15:24</a>, "if it occur away from the eyes of the congregation through error" (in oversight), cannot be easily reconciled with this, as it seems hardly conceivable that an apostasy from the entire law should have remained hidden from the congregation. This "not doing all the commandments of Jehovah," of which the congregation is supposed to incur the guilt without perceiving it, might consist either in the fact that, in particular instances, whether from oversight or negligence, the whole congregation omitted to fulfil the commandments of God, i.e., certain precepts of the law, sc., in the fact that they neglected the true and proper fulfilment of the whole law, either, as Outram supposes, "by retaining to a certain extent the national rites, and following the worship of the true God, and yet at the same time acting unconsciously in opposition to the law, through having been led astray by some common errors;" or by allowing the evil example of godless rulers to seduce them to neglect their religious duties, or to adopt and join in certain customs and usages of the heathen, which appeared to be reconcilable with the law of Jehovah, though they really led to contempt and neglect of the commandments of the Lord.<p>(Note: Maimonides (see Outram, ex veterum sententia) understands this law as relating to extraneous worship; and Outram himself refers to the times of the wicked kings, "when the people neglected their hereditary rites, and, forgetting the sacred laws, fell by a common sin into the observance of the religious rites of other nations." Undoubtedly, we have historical ground in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-21.htm">2 Chronicles 29:21</a>., and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>, for this interpretation of our law, but further allusions are not excluded in consequence. We cannot agree with Baumgarten, therefore, in restricting the difference between <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13</a>. and the passage before us to the fact, that the former supposes the transgression of one particular commandment on the part of the whole congregation, whilst the latter (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-23.htm">Numbers 15:23</a>) refers to a continued lawless condition on the part of Israel.)<p>But as a disregard or neglect of the commandments of God had to be expiated, a burnt-offering was to be added to the sin-offering, that the separation of the congregation from the Lord, which had arisen from the sin of omission, might be entirely removed. The apodosis commences with &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-24.htm">Numbers 15:24</a>, but is interrupted by &#1502;&#1506;&#1497; &#1488;&#1501;, and resumed again with &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;, "it shall be, if...the whole congregation shall prepare," etc. The burnt-offering, being the principal sacrifice, is mentioned as usual before the sin-offering, although, when presented, it followed the latter, on account of its being necessary that the sin should be expiated before the congregation could sanctify its life and efforts afresh to the Lord in the burnt-offering. "One kid of the goats:" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-16.htm">Leviticus 9:16</a>, etc.) refers to the right established in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-8.htm">Numbers 15:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-9.htm">Numbers 15:9</a>, concerning the combination of the meat and drink-offering with the burnt-offering. The sin-offering was to be treated according to the rule laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14</a>.</body></html>
