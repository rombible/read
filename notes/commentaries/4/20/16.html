The ambassadors who were sent returned with a denial. The Edomites feared to receive damage by the Israelites. And had this numerous army been under any other discipline than that of the righteous God himself, there might have been cause for this jealousy. But Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing; and now the hatred revived, when the blessing was about to be inherited.

Moses sent messengers &#8230; to the king of Edom&#8212;The encampment at Kadesh was on the confines of the Edomite territory, through which the Israelites would have had an easy passage across the Arabah by Wady-el-Ghuweir, so that they could have continued their course around Moab, and approached Palestine from the east [Roberts]. The Edomites, being the descendants of Esau and tracing their line of descent from Abraham as their common stock, were recognized by the Israelites as brethren, and a very brotherly message was sent to them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">An angel, </span> to wit, the Angel of the covenant, Christ Jesus, who first appeared to Moses in the bush, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-2.htm" title="And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.">Exodus 3:2</a></span>, and afterward in the cloudy pillar, who conducted Moses and the people out of Egypt, and through the wilderness, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-19.htm" title="And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:">Exodus 14:19</a> 23:20 33:14 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-4.htm" title="Have we not power to eat and to drink?">1 Corinthians 9:4</a></span>.
