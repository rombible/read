The removal of the priestly robes from Aaron may be regarded as typical of the future disannulling of his priesthood when a priest after the order of Melchizedek should arise. “The succession of the priesthood,” says Dean Stanley (who refers to Ewald’s <span class= "ital">Geschichte, </span>5:13), “was made through that singular usage, preserved even to the latest days of the Jewish hierarchy, by the transference of the vestments and drapery of the dead High Priest to the living successor.” (<span class= "ital">Lectures on Jewish History, </span>1:182.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/20-26.htm" title="And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and shall die there....">Numbers 20:26-27</a></span>. <span class="ital">His garments — </span>His priestly garments, in token of his resignation of his office. <span class="ital">Put them upon Eleazar — </span>By way of admission and inauguration to his office. <span class="ital">In the sight of all the congregation — </span>That their hearts might be more affected with their loss of so great a pillar, and that they all might be witnesses of the translation of the priesthood from Aaron to Eleazar.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:22-29 God bids Aaron prepare to die. There is something of displeasure in these orders. Aaron must not enter Canaan, because he had failed in his duty at the waters of strife. There is much of mercy in them. Aaron, though he dies for his transgression, dies with ease, and in honour. He is gathered to his people, as one who dies in the arms of Divine grace. There is much significancy in these orders. Aaron must not enter Canaan, to show that the Levitical priesthood could make nothing perfect; that must be done by bringing in a better hope. Aaron submits, and dies in the method and manner appointed; and, for aught that appears, with as much cheerfulness as if he had been going to bed. It was a great satisfaction to Aaron to see his son, who was dear to him, preferred; and his office preserved and secured: especially, to see in this a figure of Christ's everlasting priesthood. A good man would desire, if it were the will of God, not to outlive his usefulness. Why should we covet to continue any longer in this world, than while we may do some service in it for God and our generation?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The priestly garments, wherewith Moses had invested Aaron <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-7.htm">Leviticus 8:7-9</a>, were put upon Eleazar by way of solemn transference of Aaron's office to him; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. strip Aaron of his garments&#8212;that is, his pontifical robes, in token of his resignation.
