The pretence was, that he had married a foreign wife; but probably their pride was hurt, and their envy stirred up, by his superior authority. Opposition from our near relations, and from religious friends, is most painful. But this is to be looked for, and it will be well if in such circumstances we can preserve the gentleness and meekness of Moses. Moses was thus fitted to the work he was called to. God not only cleared Moses, but praised him. Moses had the spirit of prophecy in a way which set him far above all other prophets; yet he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he; and our Lord Jesus infinitely excels him, Heb 3:1. Let Miriam and Aaron consider whom it was they insulted. We have reason to be afraid of saying or doing any thing against the servants of God. And those are presumptuous indeed who are not afraid to speak evil of dignities, 2Pe 2:10. The removal of God's presence is the surest and saddest token of God's displeasure. Woe to us, if he depart! he never departs, till by sin and folly we drive him from us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The man Moses was very meek - In this and in other passages in which Moses no less unequivocally records his own faults (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-37.htm">Deuteronomy 1:37</a>), there is the simplicity of one who bare witness of himself, but not to himself (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-29</a>).

The Targum of Jonathan reads, "I beseech you"; and Jarchi says, this particle always so signifies; but it is not so agreeable to the language of the divine Being: <p>if there be a prophet among you; not as making a doubt of it, but rather allowing that there was, and that there were others besides Moses, as even they themselves, Aaron and Miriam, and the seventy elders, and perhaps others; or at least there had been, and would be again, as there were in later times: <p>I the Lord will make myself known to him; that is, declare my mind and will concerning things present, or things to come: <p>in a vision; when awake, either by day or by night, representing objects to the bodily sight; as the almond tree rod, and the boiling pot, to Jeremiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>; the visions of the chariots, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-24.htm">Ezekiel 23:24</a>, and dry bones, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1</a>, to Ezekiel, and such as were shown to Amos, <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-1.htm">Amos 7:1</a>, or to the mind by night, as if really discerned by the senses; as the visions of the man riding on a red horse, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>, and of the four horns, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-18.htm">Zechariah 1:18</a>, and four carpenters, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-20.htm">Zechariah 1:20</a>, with several others shown to Zechariah: <p>and will speak unto him in a dream; as he had done to Jacob, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-11.htm">Genesis 31:11</a>, and as he did afterwards to Daniel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>, and many others. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, <i>I</i> the LORD will make myself known unto him in a <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> vision, <i>and</i> will speak unto him in a dream.</span><p>(c) These were the two ordinary means.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">if there be a prophet among you, I</span> <span class="bld">Jehovah</span> &c.] The Heb. text is corrupt.

An internal vision, in which the eyes (even if open) saw nothing, but the effects of vision' were produced upon the sensorium by other and supernatural means (see, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7, 8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>). Speak unto him in a dream. Rather, speak "in him" - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>. The voice that spake to the prophet was an internal voice, causing no vibration of the outer air, but affecting only the inner and hidden seat of consciousness. It is not necessary to restrict the prophetic dream to the time of sleep; a waking state, resembling what we call day-dream, in which the external senses arc quiescent, and the imagination is freed from its usual restraints, was perhaps the more usual mental condition at the time. Indeed the Divine communications made to Joseph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>) and to the Magi (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-12.htm">Numbers 2:12</a>) are almost the only ones we read of as made during actual sleep, unless we include the case of Pilate's wife (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-19.htm">Numbers 27:19</a>); and none of these were prophets in the ordinary sense. Compare, however, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a> b. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From the graves of greediness the people removed to Hazeroth, and there they remained (&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>). The situation of these two places of encampment is altogether unknown. Hazeroth, it is true, has been regarded by many since Burckhardt (Syr. p. 808) as identical with the modern Hadhra (in Robinson's Pal. Ain el Hudhera), eighteen hours to the north-east of Sinai, partly because of the resemblance in the name, and partly because there are not only low palm-trees and bushes there, but also a spring, of which Robinson says (Pal. i. p. 223) that it is the only spring in the neighbourhood, and yields tolerably good water, though somewhat brackish, the whole year round. But Hadhra does not answer to the Hebrew &#1495;&#1510;&#1512;, to shut in, from which Hazeroth (enclosures) is derived; and there are springs in many other places in the desert of et Tih with both drinkable and brackish water. Moreover, the situation of this well does not point to Hadhra, which is only two days' journey from Sinai, so that the Israelites might at any rate have pitched their tents by this well after their first journey of three days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>), whereas they took three days to reach the graves of lust, and then marched from thence to Hazeroth. Consequently they would only have come to Hadhra on the supposition that they had been about to take the road to the sea, and intended to march along the coast to the Arabah, and so on through the Arabah to the Dead Sea (Robinson, p. 223); in which case, however, they would not have arrived at Kadesh. The conjecture that Kibroth-hattaavah is the same as Di-Sahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>), the modern Dahab (Mersa Dahab, Minna el Dahab), to the east of Sinai, on the Elanitic Gulf, is still more untenable. For what end could be answered by such a circuitous route, which, instead of bringing the Israelites nearer to the end of their journey, would have taken them to Mecca rather than to Canaan? As the Israelites proceeded from Hazeroth to Kadesh in the desert of Paran (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-3.htm">Numbers 13:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>), they must have marched from Sinai to Canaan by the most direct route, through the midst of the great desert of et Tih, most probably by the desert road which leads from the Wady es Sheikh into the Wady ez-Zuranuk, which breaks through the southern border mountains of et Tih, and passes on through the Wady ez-Zalakah over el Ain to Bir-et-Themmed, and then due north past Jebel Araif to the Hebron road. By this route they could go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea in eleven days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>), and it is here that we are to seek for the two stations in question. Hazeroth is probably to be found, as Fries and Kurtz suppose, in Bir-et-Themmed, and Kibroth-hattaavah in the neighbourhood of the southern border mountains of et Tih. </body></html>
