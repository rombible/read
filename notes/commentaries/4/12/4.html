The pretence was, that he had married a foreign wife; but probably their pride was hurt, and their envy stirred up, by his superior authority. Opposition from our near relations, and from religious friends, is most painful. But this is to be looked for, and it will be well if in such circumstances we can preserve the gentleness and meekness of Moses. Moses was thus fitted to the work he was called to. God not only cleared Moses, but praised him. Moses had the spirit of prophecy in a way which set him far above all other prophets; yet he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he; and our Lord Jesus infinitely excels him, Heb 3:1. Let Miriam and Aaron consider whom it was they insulted. We have reason to be afraid of saying or doing any thing against the servants of God. And those are presumptuous indeed who are not afraid to speak evil of dignities, 2Pe 2:10. The removal of God's presence is the surest and saddest token of God's displeasure. Woe to us, if he depart! he never departs, till by sin and folly we drive him from us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The man Moses was very meek - In this and in other passages in which Moses no less unequivocally records his own faults (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-24.htm">Exodus 4:24</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-37.htm">Deuteronomy 1:37</a>), there is the simplicity of one who bare witness of himself, but not to himself (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-29</a>).

As one greatly provoked, and highly displeased, and which was shown at once; and in order to prevent the complaint getting among the people, and spreading, which might have been of bad consequence, as they were pretty much disposed to murmur and mutiny; as also to show that it was not through any solicitation of Moses that the Lord took this matter in hand, time not being allowed to him to make any application to him; for, as soon as ever Miriam and Aaron had uttered their speech against him, the Lord spake to them: <p>come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation; everyone out of his tent, as Aben Ezra; though it is not improbable that they were all together in the tent of Moses, whither Aaron and Miriam were come to contend with him; the words seem to be spoken quick, and in haste, as being angry: <p>and they three came out: of the place where they were, to the tabernacle of the congregation, that so the people might not hear what was said unto them, and what was the occasion of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation.

It was not intended for congregational purposes (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,">Numbers 1:1</a>), but for obtaining an oracular answer from God. And it is possible that this use explains the original meaning of its name, <span class="ital">’ôhel mô‛çd</span>. The word <span class="ital">mô‛çd</span> denotes ‘a fixed time,’ ‘sacred season.’ The Assyr. word <span class="ital">âdânu</span>, from the same root, described one of the functions of Babylonian priests, i.e. that of determining the right or auspicious time for an undertaking. And it has been suggested, though it cannot at present be regarded as more than a guess, that the Heb. expression may originally have denoted ‘the tent where the proper time for an undertaking was determined,’ and hence, more generally, the ‘oracletent.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord spake suddenly</span>.

This catastrophe is not to be regarded as "the effect of the excessive quantity of quails that they had eaten, on account of the quails feeding upon things which are injurious to man, so that eating the flesh of quails produces convulsions and giddiness (for proofs, see Bochart, Hieroz. ii. pp. 657ff.)," as Knobel supposes, but as an extraordinary judgment inflicted by God upon the greedy people, by which a great multitude of people were suddenly swept away. </body></html>
