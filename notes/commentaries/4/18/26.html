Those who have God for their Inheritance and their Portion for ever, ought to look with holy contempt and indifference upon the possessions of this world. The Levites were to give God his dues out of their tithes, as well as the Israelites out of their increase. See, in ver. 31, the way to have comfort in all our worldly possessions, so as to bear no sin by reason of them. 1. We must be sure that what we have is got honestly and in the service of God. That meat is best eaten which is first earned; but if any will not work, neither shall he eat, 2Th 3:10. 2. We must be sure that God has his dues out of it. We have the comfort of our substance, when we have honoured the Lord with it. Ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved the best from it. We should give alms of such things as we have, that all may be holy and comfortable to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Here the tithes (and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26</a> the priestly tithes) are to be dedicated to their purpose by the ceremony of heaving them to the Lord.

The best of their tithes was to be assigned to the priests, and afterwards they enjoyed the same liberty to make use of the remainder that other Israelites had of the produce of their threshing-floors and wine-presses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them,.... Aaron was to tell them what a provision would be made for them on account of their service, but Moses was to inform them what part Aaron was to have out of it: <p>when ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance; which was done at the time of their harvest, and of the ingathering of the fruits of the earth: <p>then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord; in token of gratitude for the liberal provision he had made for the maintenance of them: <p>even a tenth part of the tithe; a tenth part out of the tenth of the produce of the land of Israel. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the Lord, even a tenth part of the tithe.</span> Thus the principle of giving a tenth part of all to God was carried out consistently throughout the whole of his people. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For this reason, Aaron was to received no inheritance in the land among the children of Israel. Aaron, as the head of the priests, represents the whole priesthood; and with regard to the possession, the whole tribe of Levi is placed, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-23.htm">Numbers 18:23</a>, on an equality with the priests. The Levites were to receive no portion of the land as an inheritance in Canaan (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-62.htm">Numbers 26:62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-12.htm">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-27.htm">Deuteronomy 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-3.htm">Joshua 14:3</a>). Jehovah was the portion and inheritance, not only of Aaron and his sons, but of the whole tribe of Levi (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-2.htm">Deuteronomy 18:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-33.htm">Joshua 13:33</a>); or, as it is expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-7.htm">Joshua 18:7</a>, "the priesthood of Jehovah was their inheritance," though not in the sense that Knobel supposes viz., "the priesthood with its revenues," which would make the expression "Jehovah, the God of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-33.htm">Joshua 13:33</a>), to be metonymical for "sacrificial gifts, first-fruits, and tenths." The possession of the priests and Levites did not consist in the revenues assigned to them by God, but in the possession of Jehovah, the God of Israel. In the same sense in which the tribe of Levi was the peculiar possession of Jehovah out of the whole of the people of possession, was Jehovah also the peculiar possession of Levi; and just as the other tribes were to live upon what was afforded by the land assigned them as a possession, Levi was to live upon what Jehovah bestowed upon it. And inasmuch as not only the whole land of the twelve tribes, with which Jehovah had enfeoffed them, but the whole earth, belonged to Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>), He was necessarily to be regarded as the greatest possession of all, beyond which nothing greater is conceivable, and in comparison with which every other possession is to be regarded as nothing. Hence it was evidently the greatest privilege and highest honour to have Him for a portion and possession (Bhr, Symbolik, ii. p. 44). "For truly," as Masius writes (Com. on Josh.), "he who possesses God possesses all things; and the worship (cultus) of Him is infinitely fuller of delight, and far more productive, than the cultivation (cultus) of any soil." </body></html>
