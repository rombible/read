The altar (of burnt offering) and "that within the vail (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>) were the two points between which the exclusive duties of the priesthood lay, including the service of the holy place. <span class="cmt_word">A service of gift.</span> A service which was not to be regarded as a burden, or a misfortune, or as a natural heritage and accident of birth, but to be received and cherished as a favour accorded to them by the goodness of God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Official Duties and Rights of the Priests and Levites. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>. To impress upon the minds of the priests and Levites the holiness and responsibility of their office, the service of Aaron, of his sons, and of his father's house, i.e., of the family of the Kohathites, is described as "bearing the iniquity of the sanctuary," and the service which was peculiar to the Aaronides, as "bearing the iniquity of their priesthood." "To bear the iniquity of the sanctuary" signifies not only "to have to make expiation for all that offended against the laws of the priests and the holy things, i.e., the desecration of these" (Knobel), but "iniquity or transgression at the sanctuary," i.e., the defilement of it by the sin of those who drew near to the sanctuary; not only of the priests and Levites, but of the whole people who defiled the sanctuary in the midst of them with its holy vessels, not only by their sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-6.htm">Leviticus 16:6</a>), but even by their holy gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>), and thus brought guilt upon the whole congregation, which the priests were to bear, i.e., to take upon themselves and expunge, by virtue of the holiness and sanctifying power communicated to their office (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a>). The "iniquity of the priesthood," however, not only embraced every offence against the priesthood, every neglect of the most scrupulous and conscientious fulfilment of duty in connection with their office, but extended to all the sin which attached to the official acts of the priests, on account of the sinfulness of their nature. It was to wipe out these sins and defilements, that the annual expiation of the holy things on the day of atonement had been appointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-16.htm">Leviticus 16:16</a>.). The father's house of Aaron, i.e., the Levitical family of Kohath, was also to join in bearing the iniquity of the sanctuary, because the oversight of the holy vessels of the sanctuary devolved upon it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>.).</body></html>
