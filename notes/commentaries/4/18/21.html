Those who have God for their Inheritance and their Portion for ever, ought to look with holy contempt and indifference upon the possessions of this world. The Levites were to give God his dues out of their tithes, as well as the Israelites out of their increase. See, in ver. 31, the way to have comfort in all our worldly possessions, so as to bear no sin by reason of them. 1. We must be sure that what we have is got honestly and in the service of God. That meat is best eaten which is first earned; but if any will not work, neither shall he eat, 2Th 3:10. 2. We must be sure that God has his dues out of it. We have the comfort of our substance, when we have honoured the Lord with it. Ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved the best from it. We should give alms of such things as we have, that all may be holy and comfortable to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek: Jacob had promised the tithe of all wherewith God blessed him if he should return in peace to his father's house.

But the present regulation is in advance of that in Dt. in that it assigns the tithe to the Levites absolutely. According to Dt. the Levite shared it, in two years out of three, with the offerer and his household, and in the third year with the poor—‘sojourners, widows, and orphans.’ This variety led in post-Biblical times to the imposition of <span class="ital">two</span> tithes (cf. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/1-7.htm" title="The first tenth part of all increase I gave to the sons of Aaron, who ministered at Jerusalem: another tenth part I sold away, and went, and spent it every year at Jerusalem:">Tob 1:7</a> ff.).

In early days the ‘clergy’ were poor and humble persons who needed support from the charity of the rich. The contributions paid to them were at first small, and probably variable; the officials at the important sanctuaries, for example, would receive larger dues than those in country villages. But when, after the Exile, the priests and Levites advanced to a high position in the community, their demands gradually increased, until they became the grasping and avaricious rulers that we see in the Ḥasmoneans and the Sadducees.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-5.htm" title="And truly they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:">Hebrews 7:5</a> the payment of tithes by Israel is part of the argument that the Aaronic priesthood is inferior to that of Christ.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All</span> <span class="cmt_word">the tenth.</span> The tithe of all fruits and flocks had been already claimed absolutely by the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30, 32</a>). It is probable indeed that the giving of tithes had been more or less a matter of obligation from time immemorial. Abraham had paid them on one memorable occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>), and Jacob had vowed them on another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>). From this time forth, however, the tithes were formally assigned to the maintenance of the Levites, in return for their service. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Revenues of the Priests. - These are summed up in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a> in these words, "I give thee the keeping of My heave-offerings in all holy gifts for a portion, as an eternal statute." The notion of &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;, keeping, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-32.htm">Exodus 16:32</a>, is defined in the second parallel clause as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492;, a portion (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-35.htm">Leviticus 7:35</a>). The priests were to keep all the heave-offerings, as the portion which belonged to them, out of the sacrificial gifts that the children of Israel offered to the Lord. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;, heave-offerings (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>), is used here in the broadest sense, as including all the holy gifts (kodashim, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-22.htm">Leviticus 21:22</a>) which the Israelites lifted off from their possessions and presented to the Lord (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-9.htm">Numbers 5:9</a>). Among these, for example, were, first of all, the most holy gifts in the meat-offerings, sin-offerings, and trespass-offerings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-9.htm">Numbers 18:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-10.htm">Numbers 18:10</a>; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>). The burnt-offerings are not mentioned, because the whole of the flesh of these was burned upon the altar, and the skin alone fell to the portion of the priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8</a>). "From the fire," sc., of the altar. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, fire, is equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; ot , firing (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). These gifts they were to eat, as most holy, in a most holy place, i.e., in the court of the tabernacle (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6</a>), which is called "most holy" here, to lay a stronger emphasis upon the precept. In the second place, these gifts included also "the holy gifts;" viz., (a) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>) the heave-offering of their gifts in all wave-offerings (tenuphoth), i.e., the wave-breast and heave-leg of the peace-offerings, and whatever else was waved in connection with the sacrifices (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-33.htm">Leviticus 7:33</a>): these might be eaten by both the male and female members of the priestly families, provided they were legally clean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-3.htm">Leviticus 22:3</a>.); (b) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>) the gifts of first-fruits: "all the fat (i.e., the best, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-18.htm">Genesis 45:18</a>) of oil, new wine, and corn," viz., &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501;, "the first of them," the &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "the first-grown fruits" of the land, and that of all the fruit of the ground (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-10.htm">Deuteronomy 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>), corn, wine, oil, honey, and tree-fruit (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>, compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-23.htm">Leviticus 19:23-24</a>), which were offered, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-5.htm">2 Chronicles 31:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-36.htm">Nehemiah 10:36</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a>, Tob. 1:6, as first-fruits every year (see Mishnah, Bikkur, i. 3, 10, where the first-fruits are specified according to the productions mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>; the law prescribed nothing in relation to the quantity of the different first-fruits, but left this entirely to the offerer himself); (c) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-14.htm">Numbers 18:14</a>) everything placed under a ban (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>); and (d) (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15-18</a>) the first-born of man and beast. The first-born of men and of unclean beasts were redeemed according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-47.htm">Numbers 3:47</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12-13</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-6.htm">Leviticus 27:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-27.htm">Leviticus 27:27</a>; but such as were fit for sacrifice were actually offered, the blood being swung against the altar, and the fat portions burned upon it, whilst the whole of the flesh fell to the portion of the priests. So far as the redemption of human beings was concerned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>), they were "to redeem from the monthly child," i.e., the first-born child as soon as it was a month old. </body></html>
