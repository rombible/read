Godliness has the promise of the life that now is. And from the provision here made for the priests, the apostle shows that it is the duty of christian churches to maintain their ministers. Scandalous maintenance makes scandalous ministers. The priests were to be wholly devoted to their ministry, not diverted from it, or disturbed in it, by worldly care or business. Also, that they might be examples of living by faith, not only in God's providence, but in his ordinances. The best should be offered for the first-fruits unto the Lord.

This figurative form of expression was evidently founded on the conservative property of salt, which keeps meat from corruption; and hence it became an emblem of inviolability and permanence. It is a common phrase among Oriental people, who consider the eating of salt a pledge of fidelity, binding them in a covenant of friendship. Hence the partaking of the altar meats, which were appropriated to the priests on condition of their services and of which salt formed a necessary accompaniment, was naturally called "a covenant of salt" (Le 2:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A covenant of salt, </span> i.e. a durable and perpetual covenant; so called here and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-5.htm" title="Ought you not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?">2 Chronicles 13:5</a></span>, either because salt is a sign of incorruption, as being of singular use to preserve things from corruption; or because it is confirmed and ratified on their part by salt, which is therefore called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the salt of the covenant, </span> for which the priests were obliged to take care that it should never be <span class="ital">lacking from any meat-offering</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-13.htm" title="And every oblation of your meat offering shall you season with salt; neither shall you suffer the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your meat offering: with all your offerings you shall offer salt.">Leviticus 2:13</a></span>.

Salt was the natural emblem of that which is incorruptible; wherefore a binding alliance was (and still is) made by eating bread and salt together, and salt was always added to the sacrifices of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Revenues of the Priests. - These are summed up in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a> in these words, "I give thee the keeping of My heave-offerings in all holy gifts for a portion, as an eternal statute." The notion of &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;, keeping, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-6.htm">Exodus 12:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/16-32.htm">Exodus 16:32</a>, is defined in the second parallel clause as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492;, a portion (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-35.htm">Leviticus 7:35</a>). The priests were to keep all the heave-offerings, as the portion which belonged to them, out of the sacrificial gifts that the children of Israel offered to the Lord. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;, heave-offerings (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>), is used here in the broadest sense, as including all the holy gifts (kodashim, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-22.htm">Leviticus 21:22</a>) which the Israelites lifted off from their possessions and presented to the Lord (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-9.htm">Numbers 5:9</a>). Among these, for example, were, first of all, the most holy gifts in the meat-offerings, sin-offerings, and trespass-offerings (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-9.htm">Numbers 18:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-10.htm">Numbers 18:10</a>; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>). The burnt-offerings are not mentioned, because the whole of the flesh of these was burned upon the altar, and the skin alone fell to the portion of the priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8</a>). "From the fire," sc., of the altar. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, fire, is equivalent to &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1492; ot , firing (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). These gifts they were to eat, as most holy, in a most holy place, i.e., in the court of the tabernacle (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-9.htm">Leviticus 6:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-19.htm">Leviticus 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6</a>), which is called "most holy" here, to lay a stronger emphasis upon the precept. In the second place, these gifts included also "the holy gifts;" viz., (a) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-11.htm">Numbers 18:11</a>) the heave-offering of their gifts in all wave-offerings (tenuphoth), i.e., the wave-breast and heave-leg of the peace-offerings, and whatever else was waved in connection with the sacrifices (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-33.htm">Leviticus 7:33</a>): these might be eaten by both the male and female members of the priestly families, provided they were legally clean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-3.htm">Leviticus 22:3</a>.); (b) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>) the gifts of first-fruits: "all the fat (i.e., the best, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-18.htm">Genesis 45:18</a>) of oil, new wine, and corn," viz., &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501;, "the first of them," the &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, "the first-grown fruits" of the land, and that of all the fruit of the ground (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-10.htm">Deuteronomy 26:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-30.htm">Ezekiel 44:30</a>), corn, wine, oil, honey, and tree-fruit (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>, compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-23.htm">Leviticus 19:23-24</a>), which were offered, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-5.htm">2 Chronicles 31:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-36.htm">Nehemiah 10:36</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-38.htm">Nehemiah 10:38</a>, Tob. 1:6, as first-fruits every year (see Mishnah, Bikkur, i. 3, 10, where the first-fruits are specified according to the productions mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>; the law prescribed nothing in relation to the quantity of the different first-fruits, but left this entirely to the offerer himself); (c) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-14.htm">Numbers 18:14</a>) everything placed under a ban (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>); and (d) (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15-18</a>) the first-born of man and beast.

So far as the redemption of human beings was concerned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>), they were "to redeem from the monthly child," i.e., the first-born child as soon as it was a month old. </body></html>
