All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Offer ... offering - Compare the margin Aaron pointed to the Levites, and then waved his hands, indicating (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a> note) that the offering was dedicated to God, and, again, by grant from Him, withdrawn for the use of the priests.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. after that, shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation&#8212;into the court, to assist the priests; and at removal into the tabernacle&#8212;that is, into the door of it&#8212;to receive the covered furniture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel.

By this imposition of hands they made the sacrificial animals their representatives, in which they presented their own bodies to the Lord as a living sacrifice well-pleasing to Him. The signification of the dedication of the Levites, as here enjoined, is still further explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-13.htm">Numbers 8:13-19</a>. The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-13.htm">Numbers 8:13</a>. is this: According to the command already given (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6-12</a>), thou shalt place the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and wave them as a wave-offering before the Lord, and so separate them from the midst of the children of Israel, that they may be Mine. They shall then come to serve the tabernacle. So shalt thou cleanse them and wave them. The same reason is assigned for this in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-16.htm">Numbers 8:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-17.htm">Numbers 8:17</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-11.htm">Numbers 3:11-13</a> (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-13.htm">Numbers 3:13</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-18.htm">Numbers 8:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>, what was commanded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-9</a> is described as having been carried out.
