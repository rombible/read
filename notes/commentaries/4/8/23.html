All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Were purified - Rather, purified themselves; as directed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-7.htm">Numbers 8:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. to make an atonement for the children of Israel, &c.&#8212;to aid the priests in that expiatory work; or, as the words may be rendered, "to make redemption for" the Levites being exchanged or substituted for the first-born for this important end, that there might be a sanctified body of men appointed to guard the sanctuary, and the people not allowed to approach or presumptuously meddle with holy things, which would expose them to the angry judgments of Heaven.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake unto Moses,....

By this imposition of hands they made the sacrificial animals their representatives, in which they presented their own bodies to the Lord as a living sacrifice well-pleasing to Him. The signification of the dedication of the Levites, as here enjoined, is still further explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-13.htm">Numbers 8:13-19</a>. The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-13.htm">Numbers 8:13</a>. is this: According to the command already given (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6-12</a>), thou shalt place the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and wave them as a wave-offering before the Lord, and so separate them from the midst of the children of Israel, that they may be Mine. They shall then come to serve the tabernacle. So shalt thou cleanse them and wave them. The same reason is assigned for this in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-16.htm">Numbers 8:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-17.htm">Numbers 8:17</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-11.htm">Numbers 3:11-13</a> (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-13.htm">Numbers 3:13</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-18.htm">Numbers 8:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>, what was commanded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-9</a> is described as having been carried out.
