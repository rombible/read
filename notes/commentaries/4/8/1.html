But from the tenor of the instructions, it is more likely that they were given immediately after the Levites had been given to the priests (see on [65]Nu 3:1-4:49), and that the record of these instructions had been postponed till the narrative of other transactions in the camp had been made [Patrick].How the lamps are to be lighted, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/8-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Numbers 8:1-4</a></span>.

[Note: .VV. The English Versions, i.e. Authorised and Revised.] ) stood in the Holy Place, on the south side, i.e. on the left of one entering from the court. It was the only source of light in the Tabernacle, the Holy of Holies being in darkness. The religious conceptions attaching to it in the time of the writer may be seen from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/4-1.htm" title="And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep....">Zechariah 4:1-6</a> a, Zec 4:10b – Zec 4:14.

The attempt of modern commentators to find a real connection between this section and the offering of the princes or the consecration of the Levites is simply futile. Such connection may be imagined, but the same ingenuity would obviously be equally successful if this section had been inserted in any other place from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37.htm">Exodus 37</a>, to the end of this book. The more probable explanation will be given below. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>All the princes brought the same gifts. The order in which the twelve princes, whose names have already been given at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5-15</a>, made their presentation, corresponded to the order of the tribes in the camp (ch. 2), the tribe-prince of Judah taking the lead, and the prince of Naphtali coming last. In the statements as to the weight of the silver kearoth and the golden cappoth, the word shekel is invariably omitted, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-16.htm">Genesis 20:16</a>, etc. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7-84.htm">Numbers 7:84-86</a>, the dedication gifts are summed up, and the total weight given, viz., twelve silver dishes and twelve silver bowls, weighing together 2400 shekels, and twelve golden spoons, weighing 120 shekels in all. On the sacred shekel, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; and on the probable value of the shekel of gold, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24-25</a>. The sacrificial animals are added together in the same way in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7-87.htm">Numbers 7:87</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/7-88.htm">Numbers 7:88</a>. </body></html>
