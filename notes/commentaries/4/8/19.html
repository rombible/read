All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make an atonement for the children of Israel - i. e. by performing those services which were due from the children of Israel; the omission of which by the children of Israel would, but for the interposition of the Levites, have called down "wrath" from God, or <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a> "plague." The institution of the Levites was an extension of that mediatorial system which the people themselves, terrified at the direct manifestations to them of the divine presence, desired; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-25.htm">Deuteronomy 5:25</a>. Further, it is suggested to us here as an act of mercy on the part of God; yet even the priests and Levites themselves were not always sufficiently heedful and reverent.

It is usually confined to purely sacerdotal ministrations, but it clearly has a somewhat different scope here. The idea that the Levites "made an atonement" by assisting the priests in the subordinate details of sacrifice hardly needs refutation: as well might the Gibeonites be said to "make an atonement" because they supplied the altar fire with wood. The real parallel to this is to be found in the case of Phinehas, of whom God testified that "he hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel," and "made an atonement for the children of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11, 13</a>). It is evident that Phinehas turned away the wrath of God not by offering any sacrifices, but by making the sin which aroused that wrath to cease: he made an atonement for the people by discharging for them that holy and bounden  duty (of putting away sin) which the rest of them failed to perform. Similarly the Levites made an atonement not by offering sacrifice (which they could no more do than the children of Judah), but by rendering unto God those personal duties of attendance and service in his courts which <span class="accented">all</span> the people ought to have rendered had they only been fit. <span class="cmt_word">That there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.</span> See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>. The children of Israel were in this strait. As "an holy nation," they were all bound, and their first-born as redeemed from the destroyer were specially bound, to render certain religious duties to God. But if they had attempted to render them they would have erred through ignorance and foolishness, and so <span class="accented">have</span> incurred Divine wrath and punishment, when they came nigh unto the sanctuary. From this strait the substitution of the Levites delivered them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Levites were then to close this transfer of themselves to the Lord with a sin-offering and burnt-offering, in which they laid their hands upon the sacrificial animals. By this imposition of hands they made the sacrificial animals their representatives, in which they presented their own bodies to the Lord as a living sacrifice well-pleasing to Him. The signification of the dedication of the Levites, as here enjoined, is still further explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-13.htm">Numbers 8:13-19</a>. The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-13.htm">Numbers 8:13</a>. is this: According to the command already given (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6-12</a>), thou shalt place the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and wave them as a wave-offering before the Lord, and so separate them from the midst of the children of Israel, that they may be Mine. They shall then come to serve the tabernacle. So shalt thou cleanse them and wave them. The same reason is assigned for this in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-16.htm">Numbers 8:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-17.htm">Numbers 8:17</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-11.htm">Numbers 3:11-13</a> (&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512; for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512;, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-13.htm">Numbers 3:13</a>); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-18.htm">Numbers 8:18</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>, what was commanded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-9</a> is described as having been carried out.
