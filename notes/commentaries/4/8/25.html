How merciful and full of compassion are the laws of God! When his servants became advanced in years in his service, they were not required to do the same work which they did when younger. But doubtless many of them, who were of age to take the benefit of this kind provision made for them, would show their love to God by still exerting in some way their last remains of strength in his service. And surely happy are they who, by the blessing of God on a temperate life, are preserved to old age, with strength to labour in His service who gave them being, and died to redeem them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:5-26 Here we have directions for the solemn ordination of the Levites. All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Twenty and five years old and upward - The permanent limit as distinguished from the temporary <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/4-30.htm">Numbers 4:30</a>, though David found it necessary to extend the period of the Levites' service by causing it to commence at 20 years of age <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24-28</a>.

The heavy service of it: <p>and shall serve no more; by bearing and carrying the vessels of the sanctuary upon their shoulders, as Jarchi interprets it; this, according to the Jewish writers, was only in force while the tabernacle was in the wilderness, and was moved from place to place: but when it had a fixed habitation, and that laborious service of bearing and carrying the vessels of it ceased, years made no difference in the Levites, or disqualified them for service; for it is said (x), that the Levites were not bound by this law, but in the time of the tabernacle; but when it was at Shiloh, and at Jerusalem, where there was no bearing and carrying upon the shoulder, the Levites were not rejected on account of years, only for their voice, when they had lost that, and could not sing. <p>(x) Maimon. &amp; Bartenora in Misn.

By this imposition of hands they made the sacrificial animals their representatives, in which they presented their own bodies to the Lord as a living sacrifice well-pleasing to Him. The signification of the dedication of the Levites, as here enjoined, is still further explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-13.htm">Numbers 8:13-19</a>. The meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-13.htm">Numbers 8:13</a>. is this: According to the command already given (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6-12</a>), thou shalt place the Levites before Aaron and his sons, and wave them as a wave-offering before the Lord, and so separate them from the midst of the children of Israel, that they may be Mine. They shall then come to serve the tabernacle. So shalt thou cleanse them and wave them.
