All Israel must know that they took not this honour to themselves, but were called of God to it; nor was it enough that they were distinguished from others. All who are employed for God, must be dedicated to him, according to the employment. Christians must be baptized, ministers must be ordained; we must first give ourselves unto the Lord, and then our services. The Levites must be cleansed. They must be clean that bear the vessels of the Lord. Moses must sprinkle the water of purifying upon them. This signifies the application of the blood of Christ to our souls by faith, that we may be fit to serve the living God. God declares his acceptance of them. All who expect to share in the privileges of the tabernacle, must resolve to do the service of the tabernacle. As, on the one hand, none of God's creatures are his necessary servants, he needs not the service of any of them; so none are merely honorary servants, to do nothing. All whom God owns, he employs; angels themselves have their services.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Offer ... offering - Compare the margin Aaron pointed to the Levites, and then waved his hands, indicating (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a> note) that the offering was dedicated to God, and, again, by grant from Him, withdrawn for the use of the priests.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13. And Aaron shall offer the Levites&#8212;Hebrew, "as a wave offering"; and it has been thought probable that the high priest, in bringing the Levites one by one to the altar, directed them to make some simple movements of their persons, analogous to what was done at the presentation of the wave offerings before the Lord. Thus were they first devoted as an offering to God, and by Him surrendered to the priests to be employed in His service. The consecration ceremonial was repeated in the case of every Levite who was taken (as was done at a later period) to assist the priests in the tabernacle and temple.

But before entering upon their duties they were to be consecrated to the work, and then formally handed over to the priests. This consecration is commanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-7.htm">Numbers 8:7</a>., and is not called &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, like the consecration of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11</a>), but &#1496;&#1492;&#1512; to cleanse. It consisted in sprinkling them with sin-water, shaving off the whole of the hair from their bodies, and washing their clothes, accompanied by a sacrificial ceremony, by which they were presented symbolically to the Lord as a sacrifice for His service. The first part of this ceremony had reference to outward purification, and represented cleansing from the defilement of sin; hence the performance of it is called &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488; (to cleanse from sin) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-21.htm">Numbers 8:21</a>. "Sprinkle sin-water upon them." The words are addressed to Moses, who had to officiate at the inauguration of the Levites, as he had already done at that of the priests. "Water of sin" is water having reference to sin, designed to remove it, just as the sacrifice offered for the expiation of sin is called &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; (sin) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-14.htm">Leviticus 4:14</a>, etc.; whilst the "water of uncleanness" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/19-9.htm">Numbers 19:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>, signifies water by which uncleanness was removed or wiped away. The nature of this purifying water is not explained, and cannot be determined with any certainty. We find directions for preparing sprinkling water in a peculiar manner, for the purpose of cleansing persons who were cured of leprosy, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-5.htm">Leviticus 14:5</a>., 50ff.; and also for cleansing both persons and houses that had been defiled by a corpse, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-9.htm">Numbers 19:9</a>. Neither of these, however, was applicable to the cleansing of the Levites, as they were both of them composed of significant ingredients, which stood in the closest relation to the special cleansing to be effected by them, and had evidently no adaptation to the purification of the Levites. At the same time, the expression "sin-water" precludes our understanding it to mean simply clean water. So that nothing remains but to regard it as referring to the water in the laver of the sanctuary, which was provided for the purpose of cleansing the priests for the performance of their duties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>.), and might therefore be regarded by virtue of this as cleansing from sin, and be called "sin-water" in consequence. "And they shall cause the razor to pass over their whole body," i.e., shave off all the hair upon their body, "and wash their clothes, and so cleanse themselves." &#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512; is to be distinguished from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1495;. The latter signifies to make balk or shave the hair entirely off, which was required of the leper when he was cleansed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8-9</a>); the former signifies merely cutting the hair, which was part of the regular mode of adorning the body. The Levites also were not required to bathe their bodies, as lepers were (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-8.htm">Leviticus 13:8-9</a>), and also the priests at their consecration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>), because they were not affected with any special uncleanness, and their duties did not require them to touch the most holy instruments of worship. The washing of the clothes, on the other hand, was a thing generally required as a preparation for acts of worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10</a>), and was omitted in the case of the consecration of the priests, simply because they received a holy official dress. &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/30-18.htm">2 Chronicles 30:18</a>. </body></html>
