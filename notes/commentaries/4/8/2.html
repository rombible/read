The golden candlestick was placed against the south wall of the Tabernacle, opposite to the table of shewbread, so that its seven branches were parallel to that wall, with its branches east and west, and consequently the seven lamps, one of which rested upon each of the seven branches, threw their light in front of the candlestick, i.e., towards the north wall, by which arrangement the furniture of the holy place was more effectually lighted than it would have been had the candlestick been placed facing the entrance, with its branches north and south.<p><span class= "bld">Over against.</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">in front of.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-2.htm" title="Speak to Aaron and say to him, When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick.">Numbers 8:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">When thou lightest the lamps — </span>The priests lighted the middle lamp from the fire of the altar, and the rest one from another.

Speak unto Aaron, &c.&#8212;The candlestick, which was made of one solid, massive piece of pure gold, with six lamps supported on as many branches, a seventh in the center surmounting the shaft itself (Ex 25:31; 37:17), and completed according to the pattern shown in the mount, was now to be lighted, when the other things in the sanctuary began to be applied to religious service. It was Aaron's personal duty, as the servant of God, to light His house, which, being without windows, required the aid of lights (2Pe 1:19). And the course he was ordered to follow was first to light the middle lamp from the altar-fire, and then the other lamps from each other&#8212;a course symbolical of all the light of heavenly truth being derived from Christ, and diffused by His ministers throughout the world (Re 4:5).<p>the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick&#8212;The candlestick stood close to the boards of the sanctuary, on the south side, in full view of the table of showbread on the north (Ex 26:35), having one set of its lamps turned towards the east, and another towards the west; so that all parts of the tabernacle were thus lighted up.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. On every side of the candlestick. So the <span class="ital">candlestick</span> is here put for the bulk or shaft of the candlestick, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-31.htm" title="And you shall make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.">Exodus 25:31</a>,35</span>, and the lamps, when they were lighted, were put into the branches of the candlestick, and take it out upon occasion. Thus the meaning is, that all the lamps were to be lighted on that part which was towards the middle, looking that way whence they had their light; for the middle lamp was lighted with the fire of the altar, and from that the other lamps received light. But against this sense it is objected, that the lamps could not be otherwise ordered, but that they must give light round about the candlestick, and therefore that sense seems to make this direction idle and frivolous. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. On that part which is before the candlestick, Heb. <span class="ital">over against the face of the candlestick</span>, i.e. in that place towards which the candlestick looked, or where the candlestick stood in full view, i.e. upon the north side, where the table of shewbread stood, as appears from hence, because the candlestick stood close to the boards of the sanctuary on the south side, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-35.htm" title="And you shall set the table without the veil, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and you shall put the table on the north side.">Exodus 26:35</a></span>. And thus the lights were on both sides of the sanctuary, which was fit and necessary, because it was wholly dark in itself, and had no window in it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him,.... It being his work to light the lamps, though, as Ben Gersom observes, it was not incumbent on an high priest alone to do this, for it also belonged to the sons of Aaron, who were common priests, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>; though it is probable that as this was the first time of lighting them, it might be done by Aaron himself, his sons attending and assisting him; in which he was an eminent type of Christ, the great High Priest, who lights the lamps in all his golden candlesticks, the churches, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>, and from whom they have all their light and all the supplies of it: <p>when thou lightest the lamps; which was done at evening, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-8.htm">Exodus 30:8</a>; pointing at the great light set up by Christ, the light of the world, in the evening of it, in the last days: <p>the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick; the Targum of Jonathan is,"at the same time of thy lighting the lamps over against the candlestick, there shall be seven lamps giving light: three on the west side and three on the east side, and the seventh in the middle:''and in the like order Jarchi places them, who observes, that the three eastward looked over against the middlemost, the wicks that were in them; and so the three westward, the tops of the wicks were over against the middlemost: and he also observes, that the middlemost lamp was no other than the body of the candlestick, and so all the rest of the lamps were over against and looked to that; and this is the sense of Maimonides (m), and other Jewish writers; but the truer meaning of the phrase is, that the seven lamps gave light, as they were to do, to that part of the holy place that was opposite to the candlestick, the north part of it, where stood the shewbread table, the candlestick being in the south, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-22.htm">Exodus 40:22</a>; that the table of the Lord might have light, as it was proper it should; and the priests might see to set on and take off the bread, which otherwise they could not, there being no window in the place; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>. <p>(m) Hilchot Beth Hacbehirah, c. 3. sect. 8. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> over against the candlestick.</span><p>(a) To that part which is in the forefront of the candlestick, Ex 25:37.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">When thou</span> <span class="bld">settest up</span>] So R.V. marg. correctly. The lamps were small bowls of oil with wicks. They stood on the top of the central stem and of the three branching arms or shafts on either side.

The actual lighting of the lamps for the first time by Moses is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-25.htm">Exodus 40:25</a>. In the face of these passages it is incredible that the lamps had not been regularly lighted by Aaron for more than a month before the offering of the princes. The seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick. It is somewhat uncertain what this expression, here  repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-37.htm">Exodus 25:37</a>, means. The Targums give no explanation of it; the Septuagint merely renders verbally, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; the Jewish expositors seem to have thought that the light was to be thrown inward towards the central shaft; most modern commentators, with more probability, understand it to mean that the lamps were to be so placed as to throw their light across the tabernacle towards the north side. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>All the princes brought the same gifts. The order in which the twelve princes, whose names have already been given at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5-15</a>, made their presentation, corresponded to the order of the tribes in the camp (ch. 2), the tribe-prince of Judah taking the lead, and the prince of Naphtali coming last. In the statements as to the weight of the silver kearoth and the golden cappoth, the word shekel is invariably omitted, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/20-16.htm">Genesis 20:16</a>, etc. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/7-84.htm">Numbers 7:84-86</a>, the dedication gifts are summed up, and the total weight given, viz., twelve silver dishes and twelve silver bowls, weighing together 2400 shekels, and twelve golden spoons, weighing 120 shekels in all. On the sacred shekel, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; and on the probable value of the shekel of gold, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/38-24.htm">Exodus 38:24-25</a>.
