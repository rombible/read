They changed the names of them; probably they were idolatrous, therefore they should be forgotten. A spirit of selfishness, of seeking our own, not the things of Christ, when each one ought to assist others, is as dangerous as it is common. It is impossible to be sincere in the faith, sensible of the goodness of God, constrained by the love of Christ, sanctified by the power of the Holy Ghost, and yet be indifferent to the progress of religion, and the spiritual success of others, through love of ease, or fear of conflict. Let then your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The exploits of Jair - he was the conqueror of Argob <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> - gave new. luster to his name; and the fame of the family is attested by the history of Jair the Israelite judge, doubtless a descendant; perhaps also by the mention of Jairus <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-41.htm">Luke 8:41</a>, the ruler of the synagogue at the neighboring city of Capernaum.<p>Havoth-jair - That is, the villages, or rather groups of tents, or "kraals," of Jair.

His genealogy, which is instructive and suggestive, is given here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It will be seen that Segub, the father of Jair, was a Machirite in the female line only. His father Hezron, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21</a>, married the daughter of Manasseh in his old age, when his elder sons were probably already fathers of families. It may probably be conjectured also that Manasseh, who must have inherited exceptional wealth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-17.htm">Genesis 48:17</a>), and had but one grandson, left a large portion to his grand-daughter, the young wife of Hezron. It was therefore very natural that Segub should have attached himself to the fortunes of his mother's tribe. Is it not also very probable that Machir had other daughters (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23</a>), who also inherited large portions from their grandfather, and whose husbands were willing enough to enter into a family which had apparently brighter prospects than any others? If so, it would account at once for the existence of a large family of Machirites not descended from  Gilead, and not on the most friendly terms with the rest of the tribe. It is quite possible that many of the more adventurous spirits amongst the tribe of Judah joined themselves to a family whose reputation and exploits they might naturally claim as their own (see on Joshua 19:34). <span class="cmt_word">The small towns thereof,</span> or, "their villages." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, i.e. the hamlets of the Amorites who dwelt in Argob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>), the modern district of el Lejja, on the north-western waters of the Yermuk or Hieromax. <span class="cmt_word">And called them Havoth-jair.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>.

The word <span class="accented">chavvoth</span> only occurs in this connection, and is supposed by some to be the plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "life." There does not, however, seem to be anything except the very doubtful analogy of certain German names in favour of the rendering "Jair's lives." It is more likely the corruption of some more ancient name. There is some discrepancy in subsequent references to the Chavvoth-jair. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a>, Jair had twenty-three towns in Gilead; from <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a> it appears that the sons of the later Jair had thirty cities "in the land of Gilead" which went under the name of Chavvoth-jair; while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a> "all the Chavvoth-jair which are in Bashan" are reckoned at sixty. The plausible, though not wholly satisfactory, explanation is, that the conquests of Nobah came to be subsequently included in those of his more famous contemporary, and the vague name of Chavvoth-jair extended to all the towns in that part of Gilead, and of Bashan too (see notes on the passages cited). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Gadites built, i.e., restored and fortified, the following places. Dibon, also called Dibon Gad, an hour's journey to the north of the central Arnon. Ataroth, probably preserved in the extensive ruins of Attarus, on Jebel Attarus, between el Krriath (Kureyat) and Makur, i.e., Machaerus (see Seetzen, ii. p. 342). Aroer, not the Aroer before Rabbah, which was allotted to the Gadites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), as v. Raumer supposes; but the Aroer of Reuben in the centre of the valley of the Arnon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>), which is still to be seen in the ruins of Araayr, on the edge of the lofty rocky wall which bounds the Modjeb (Burckhardt, p. 633). Atroth Shophan: only mentioned here; situation unknown. Jaezer: probably to be sought for in the ruins of es Szir, to the west of Ammn (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-32.htm">Numbers 21:32</a>). Jogbehah: only mentioned again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-11.htm">Judges 8:11</a>, and preserved in the ruins of Jebeiha, about two hours to the north-west of Ammn (Burckhardt, p. 618; Robinson, App. p. 168). Beth-nimrah, contracted into Nimrah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a>), according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>, in the valley of the Jordan, and according to the Onomast.

Beth-Haran, or Beth-Haram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>): Beth-ramphtha, according to Josephus, Ant. 18:2, 1, which was called Julias, in honour of the wife of Augustus. According to the Onomast. it was called Beth-Ramtha by the Syrians (&#1512;&#1502;&#1514;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, the form of the Aramaean stat. emphat.), and was named Livias by Herod Antipas, in honour of Livia, the wife of Augustus. It has been preserved in the ruins of Rameh, not far from the mouth of the Wady Hesbn (Burckhardt, p. 661, and Robinson, ii. 305).
