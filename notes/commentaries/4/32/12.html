He reminds them of the fatal consequences of the unbelief and faint-heartedness of their fathers, when they were, as themselves, just ready to enter Canaan.

Whether they had really meditated such a withdrawal from all share in the war of invasion, or the effect of their leader's expostulation was to drive them from their original purpose, they now, in answer to his impressive appeal, declared it to be their sincere intention to co-operate with their brethren; but, if so, they ought to have been more explicit at first.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Kenezite; </span> so called from <span class="ital">Kenaz</span>, his grandfather, or one of his eminent ancestors, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-17.htm" title="And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.">Joshua 15:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/4-13.htm" title="And the sons of Kenaz; Othniel, and Seraiah: and the sons of Othniel; Hathath....">1 Chronicles 4:13-15</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun,.... See <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-30.htm">Numbers 14:30</a>, whether Caleb or Jephunneh is called the Kenezite is not so easy to determine; the latter rather seems to be most correct, for that Caleb should be called so from Kenaz the father of Othniel, who is said to be Caleb's brother seems not to be agreeable; since it is not likely that they were his own brothers, or Caleb would not have given his daughter to him; besides Jephunneh and not Kenaz is always said to be the father of Caleb, unless his father can be thought to have two names; it is most likely that Jephunneh, and so Caleb, might be called the Kenezite, from an ancestor of theirs of that name: Jarchi says, Caleb was the son-in-law of Kenaz, and Caleb's mother bore unto him Othniel: <p>for they have wholly followed the Lord; here what was said of Caleb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a> is said both of him and Joshua; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Kenezite.</span> See on Numbers 13:6. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses first of all blames their want of brotherly feeling: "Shall your brethren go into the war, and ye sit here?" He then calls their attention to the fact, that by their disinclination they would take away the courage and inclination of the other tribes to cross over the Jordan and conquer the land, and would bring the wrath of God upon Israel even more than their fathers who were sent from Kadesh to spy out the land, and who led away the heart of the people into rebellion through their unfavourable account of the inhabitants of Canaan, and brought so severe a judgment upon the congregation. &#1502;&#1503; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1500;&#1489; &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;, to hold away the heart, i.e., render a person averse to anything.
