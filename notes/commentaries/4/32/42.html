They changed the names of them; probably they were idolatrous, therefore they should be forgotten. A spirit of selfishness, of seeking our own, not the things of Christ, when each one ought to assist others, is as dangerous as it is common. It is impossible to be sincere in the faith, sensible of the goodness of God, constrained by the love of Christ, sanctified by the power of the Holy Ghost, and yet be indifferent to the progress of religion, and the spiritual success of others, through love of ease, or fear of conflict. Let then your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Kenath - Now Kenawat, an important site near the southern extremity of the tract el-Lejah, and on the western slopes of the mountains of the Hauran. The name given to it by its conqueror, as in other cases, fell ere long into disuse, and the old name has held its ground to this day.<p>The notices, both Scriptural and traditional, of the conquest of northeastern Gilead and Bashan by the Machirites, plainly intimate that it was effected by a few chiefs of great military prowess, who overran rapidly a far larger district than they could colonize. The father of Jair, however, Segub, was of the tribe of Judah (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a>, and note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21-22</a>), and it is likely that the Manassite leaders induced many of the more adventurous of this tribe, and some possibly of other tribes, to join them in their enterprise against Bashan (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-34.htm">Joshua 19:34</a>).<p>The Machirites did not exterminate the whole population of this district (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-15.htm">Joshua 13:15</a>, etc.). The conquest of the district east of Jordan seems never to have been so effectually accomplished as that on the other side.<p>During the troublous times of the Judges the eastern Manassites rendered good service to the nation; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>. Gideon, and probably Jephthah, were of this tribe, and reflect in a later generation the warlike and adventurous spirit which Jair and Nobah exhibited in the days of Moses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42.

Who this Nobah was is not certain, very probably a descendant of Manasseh; it is said (u) he was among those that were born in Egypt, and died after the death of Moses, and was buried beyond Jordan, as it is said, also did Machir and Jair, so that there were none left but Caleb, and Joshua: <p>and called it Nobah, after his name; but it seems that in later times its ancient name was restored to it; for Jerom (w), says there was a village in Arabia, called Cannatha, which is supposed to be this place; though he also tells us (x), that eight miles from Heshbon; to the south, is shown a desert place called Naba.

Kenath is identified by Euseb. and Jerome as <span class="ital">Kanatha</span>, the modern <span class="ital">Ḳanawât</span>, which lay on the western slope of Jebel Ḥaurân. This was far to the north, and would make the present passage imply that the Nobah clan left the district where Nobah lay and migrated. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-23.htm" title="And he took Geshur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair, from them, with Kenath, and the towns thereof, even three score cities. All these belonged to the sons of Machir the father of Gilead.">1 Chronicles 2:23</a> places Kenath in close proximity with Ḥavvôth-Jair; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-11.htm" title="And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelled in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.">Jdg 8:11</a> can be most easily explained if Kenath and Jogbehah lay near one another.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nobah.</span> As this chieftain is nowhere else named, we may probably conclude that he was one of the companions of Jair, holding a position more or less subordinate to him. <span class="cmt_word">Kenath</span>. The modern Kenawat, on the western slope of the Jebel Hauran, the most easterly point ever occupied by the Israelites. It is apparently the Nobah mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-11.htm">Judges 8:11</a>, but it has reverted (like so many others) to its old name. In spite of the uncertainties which hang over the conquest of this north-eastern territory, there is something very characteristic in the part played by the Machirite leaders. That they acted with an independent vigour bordering on audacity, that they showed great personal prowess, and had great personal authority with the humbler members of their family, and held something like the position of feudal superiors among them, is evident from the way in which they are spoken cf. And this is quite in keeping with the character of the Manassites in after times. The "governors" who came at the call of Barak, Gideon, the greatest of the warrior-judges, and probably Jephthah also ("the Gileadite"), as well as the younger Jail maintained the warlike and impetuous character of their race. If "Elijah the Tishbite" was really from this region (although this is extremely doubtful), we should find in him the characteristic daring and self-reliance of Machir transmuted into their spiritual equivalents. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Gadites built, i.e., restored and fortified, the following places. Dibon, also called Dibon Gad, an hour's journey to the north of the central Arnon. Ataroth, probably preserved in the extensive ruins of Attarus, on Jebel Attarus, between el Krriath (Kureyat) and Makur, i.e., Machaerus (see Seetzen, ii. p. 342). Aroer, not the Aroer before Rabbah, which was allotted to the Gadites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), as v. Raumer supposes; but the Aroer of Reuben in the centre of the valley of the Arnon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>), which is still to be seen in the ruins of Araayr, on the edge of the lofty rocky wall which bounds the Modjeb (Burckhardt, p. 633). Atroth Shophan: only mentioned here; situation unknown. Jaezer: probably to be sought for in the ruins of es Szir, to the west of Ammn (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-32.htm">Numbers 21:32</a>). Jogbehah: only mentioned again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/8-11.htm">Judges 8:11</a>, and preserved in the ruins of Jebeiha, about two hours to the north-west of Ammn (Burckhardt, p. 618; Robinson, App. p. 168). Beth-nimrah, contracted into Nimrah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3</a>), according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>, in the valley of the Jordan, and according to the Onomast. (s. v. &#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;) Beth-amnaram, five Roman miles to the north of Libias (Bethharam), now to be seen in the ruins of Nimrein or Nemrin, where the Wady Shaib enters the Jordan (Burckhardt, pp. 609, 661; Robinson, ii. p. 279), in a site abounding in water and pasturage (Seetzen, ii. pp. 318, 716). Beth-Haran, or Beth-Haram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a>): Beth-ramphtha, according to Josephus, Ant. 18:2, 1, which was called Julias, in honour of the wife of Augustus. According to the Onomast. it was called Beth-Ramtha by the Syrians (&#1512;&#1502;&#1514;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, the form of the Aramaean stat. emphat.), and was named Livias by Herod Antipas, in honour of Livia, the wife of Augustus.
