Moses, by showing their sin, and the danger of it, brought them to their duty, without murmuring or disputing. All men ought to consider the interests of others as well as their own; the law of love requires us to labour, venture, or suffer for each other as there may be occasion. They propose that their men of war should go ready armed before the children of Israel into the land of Canaan, and that they should not return till the conquest of Canaan was ended. Moses grants their request, but he warns them of the danger of breaking their word. If you fail, you sin against the Lord, and not against your brethren only; God will certainly reckon with you for it. Be sure your sin will find you out. Sin will surely find out the sinner sooner or later. It concerns us now to find our sins out, that we may repent of them, and forsake them, lest they find us out to our ruin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be sure your sin will find you out - literally, "know ye your sin that it will find you out." Moses implies that their sin would eventually bring its own punishment along with it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-33. Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing&#8212;with sincerity and zeal.<p>go before the Lord to war&#8212;The phrase was used in allusion to the order of march in which the tribes of Reuben and Gad immediately preceded the ark (see on [96]Nu 2:10-31), or to the passage over the Jordan, in which the ark stood in mid-channel, while all the tribes marched by in succession (Jos 3:4), of course including those of Reuben and Gad, so that, literally, they passed over before the Lord and before the rest of Israel (Jos 4:13). Perhaps, however, the phrase is used merely in a general sense to denote their marching on an expedition, the purpose of which was blessed with the presence, and destined to promote the glory, of God. The displeasure which Moses had felt on the first mention of their proposal had disappeared on the strength of their solemn assurances. But a lurking suspicion of their motives seems still to have been lingering in his mind&#8212;he continued to speak to them in an admonitory strain; and he concluded by warning them that in case of their failing to redeem their pledge, the judgments of an offended God would assuredly fall upon them. This emphatic caution against such an eventuality throws a strong doubt on the honesty of their first intentions; and yet, whether through the opposing attitude or the strong invectives of Moses they had been brought to a better state of mind, their final reply showed that now all was right.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Largely so called, as that word is oft used, for that whole country beyond Jordan, as in other places it is taken more strictly for a part of it, as here below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-39.htm" title="And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.">Numbers 32:39</a>,40</span>, and elsewhere. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,....

Upon this they promise again (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-25.htm">Numbers 32:25-27</a>), through their spokesman (as the singular &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-25.htm">Numbers 32:25</a>, and the suffix in &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-27.htm">Numbers 32:27</a>, clearly show), that they will fulfil his command. The use of the expression "before Jehovah," in the words, "go armed before Jehovah to war," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-20.htm">Numbers 32:20</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-21.htm">Numbers 32:21</a>, may be explained from the fact, that in the war which they waged at the command of their God, the Israelites were the army of Jehovah, with Jehovah in the midst. Hence the ark of the covenant was taken into the war, as the vehicle and substratum of the presence of Jehovah; whereas it remained behind in the camp, when the people wanted to press forward into Canaan of their own accord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>). But if this is the meaning of the expression "before Jehovah," we may easily understand why the Reubenites and Gadites do not make use of it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17</a>, namely, because they only promise to go equipped "before the children of Israel," i.e., to help their brethren to conquer Canaan. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-32.htm">Numbers 32:32</a> they also adopt the expression, after hearing it from the mouth of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-20.htm">Numbers 32:20</a>).<p>(Note: This completely sets aside the supposed discrepancy which Knobel adduces in support of his fragmentary hypothesis, viz., that the Elohist writes "before Israel" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-29.htm">Numbers 32:29</a>, when the Jehovist would write "before Jehovah," - a statement which is not even correct; since we find "before Jehovah" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-29.htm">Numbers 32:29</a>, which Knobel is obliged to erase from the text in order to establish his assertion.)<p>&#1504;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, innocent, "free from guilt before Jehovah and before Israel." By drawing back from participation in the war against the Canaanites, they would not only sin against Jehovah, who had promised Canaan to all Israel, and commanded them to take it, but also against Israel itself, i.e., against the rest of the tribes, as is more fully stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-7.htm">Numbers 32:7-15</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-22.htm">Numbers 32:22</a>, "before Jehovah" signifies according to the judgment of Jehovah, with divine approval. &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, "ye will know your sin," which will overtake (&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;) or smite you, i.e., ye will have to make atonement for them. </body></html>
