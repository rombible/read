They changed the names of them; probably they were idolatrous, therefore they should be forgotten. A spirit of selfishness, of seeking our own, not the things of Christ, when each one ought to assist others, is as dangerous as it is common. It is impossible to be sincere in the faith, sensible of the goodness of God, constrained by the love of Christ, sanctified by the power of the Holy Ghost, and yet be indifferent to the progress of religion, and the spiritual success of others, through love of ease, or fear of conflict. Let then your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before the Lord - i. e., immediately in front of the sacred tokens of the Lord's presence; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-17.htm">Numbers 10:17</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/32.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28-32. concerning them Moses commanded&#8212;The arrangement itself, as well as the express terms on which he assented to it, was announced by the leader to the public authorities. The pastoral country the two tribes had desired was to be granted them on condition that they would lend their aid to their brethren in the approaching invasion of Canaan. If they refused or failed to perform their promise, those possessions should be forfeited, and they themselves compelled to go across the Jordan and fight for a settlement like the rest of their brethren.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/32.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As the Lord hath said; </span> either at this time by thy mouth; or formerly, where he commandeth us as well as our brethren to go into Canaan and possess it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/32.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,...., The word is in the singular number, and shows their unanimity, that they agreed to what Moses said, and replied all of them as one man, as Jarchi expresses it; and it may be there was one that was the mouth of them all, and answered for them: <p>saying, as the Lord hath said unto thy servants, so will we do; here they make use of the word Jehovah, taking what Moses had said unto them as from the Lord, and therefore should strictly and punctually observe it, as if they heard the Lord himself speak it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.</span><p>(l) This is attributed to the Lord, which his messenger speaks.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Upon this declaration Moses absolves them from all guilt, and promises them the desired land for a possession, on condition that they fulfil their promise; but he reminds them again of the sin that they will commit, and will have to atone for, if their promise is not fulfilled, and closes with the admonition to build towns for their families and pens for their flocks, and to do what they have promised. Upon this they promise again (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-25.htm">Numbers 32:25-27</a>), through their spokesman (as the singular &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-25.htm">Numbers 32:25</a>, and the suffix in &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-27.htm">Numbers 32:27</a>, clearly show), that they will fulfil his command. The use of the expression "before Jehovah," in the words, "go armed before Jehovah to war," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-20.htm">Numbers 32:20</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-21.htm">Numbers 32:21</a>, may be explained from the fact, that in the war which they waged at the command of their God, the Israelites were the army of Jehovah, with Jehovah in the midst. Hence the ark of the covenant was taken into the war, as the vehicle and substratum of the presence of Jehovah; whereas it remained behind in the camp, when the people wanted to press forward into Canaan of their own accord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>). But if this is the meaning of the expression "before Jehovah," we may easily understand why the Reubenites and Gadites do not make use of it in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17</a>, namely, because they only promise to go equipped "before the children of Israel," i.e., to help their brethren to conquer Canaan. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-32.htm">Numbers 32:32</a> they also adopt the expression, after hearing it from the mouth of Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-20.htm">Numbers 32:20</a>).<p>(Note: This completely sets aside the supposed discrepancy which Knobel adduces in support of his fragmentary hypothesis, viz., that the Elohist writes "before Israel" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-29.htm">Numbers 32:29</a>, when the Jehovist would write "before Jehovah," - a statement which is not even correct; since we find "before Jehovah" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-29.htm">Numbers 32:29</a>, which Knobel is obliged to erase from the text in order to establish his assertion.)<p>&#1504;&#1511;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, innocent, "free from guilt before Jehovah and before Israel." By drawing back from participation in the war against the Canaanites, they would not only sin against Jehovah, who had promised Canaan to all Israel, and commanded them to take it, but also against Israel itself, i.e., against the rest of the tribes, as is more fully stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-7.htm">Numbers 32:7-15</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-22.htm">Numbers 32:22</a>, "before Jehovah" signifies according to the judgment of Jehovah, with divine approval. &#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1499;&#1501; &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, "ye will know your sin," which will overtake (&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;) or smite you, i.e., ye will have to make atonement for them. </body></html>
