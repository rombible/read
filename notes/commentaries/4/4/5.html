This not only marked the reverence due to holy things, but the mystery of the things signified by those types, and the darkness of the dispensation.

Upon the cloud's removing and the trumpets blowing: <p>Aaron shall come, and his sons; into the holy place: <p>and they shall take down the covering vail: the vail that divided between the holy and the most holy place, which covered all in the holy of holies out of sight: <p>and cover the ark of testimony with it; together with the mercy seat and cherubim on it, that they might not be seen nor touched by the Levites when they carried them. Now though the high priest himself might not go into the most holy place but once a year, on the day of atonement, yet on this occasion, when the tabernacle was to be taken down, and the things in it to be removed, both he and his sons might enter without danger; since, as Bishop Patrick observes, the divine Majesty was gone from thence in the cloud which gave the signal for the motion of the camp, and the taking down of the tabernacle. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it:</span><p>(b) Which divided the sanctuary from the holiest of holies.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5–14</span>. When finally ready for the march the burden of the Kohathites would be seen simply as six large packages as follows.—(i) The <span class="ital">Ark</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-5.htm" title="And when the camp sets forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering veil, and cover the ark of testimony with it:">Numbers 4:5</a></span> f.), covered with the ‘veil of the screen’ (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-31.htm" title="And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary with which they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof.">Numbers 3:31</a>), and a water-proof covering of dugong skin, and over this a <span class="bld">violet</span> cloth. It was carried by the staves, or <span class="bld">poles</span>, with which it was furnished for the purpose of transport (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-14.htm" title="And you shall put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.">Exodus 25:14</a>). The Ark is the only piece of furniture that has a coloured cloth over the water-proof covering; this would make it a conspicuous object on the march, (ii) The <span class="ital">Table of the Presence Bread</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-7.htm" title="And on the table of show bread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover with: and the continual bread shall be thereon:">Numbers 4:7</a></span> f., see note), covered with a violet cloth upon which all the utensils and the loaves are placed, and the whole covered with a <span class="bld">scarlet</span> cloth, and that with the dugong skin; like the Ark it was carried by poles, (iii) The <span class="ital">Lampstand</span> and all its utensils (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-9.htm" title="And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his firepans, and all the oil vessels thereof, with which they minister to it:">Numbers 4:9</a></span> f.), covered with violet cloth and dugong skin, and carried by means of a bar. (iv) The <span class="ital">Golden Altar of Incense</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-11.htm" title="And on the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put to the staves thereof:">Numbers 4:11</a></span>), covered with violet cloth and dugong skin and carried by its poles. (v) The <span class="ital">miscellaneous utensils</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-12.htm" title="And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, with which they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put them on a bar:">Numbers 4:12</a></span>) not actually belonging to any piece of furniture, covered with violet cloth and dugong skin and carried by means of a bar. (vi) The <span class="ital">Altar of Burnt-offering</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-13.htm" title="And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon:">Numbers 4:13</a></span> f.), covered with a <span class="bld">crimson</span> cloth upon which all the utensils belonging to it are placed, and the whole covered with dugong skin and carried by its poles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reason for the additional scarlet cloth over the Table is unknown. The use of cloth of a different colour in the case of the Altar of Burnt-offering may have been because the Altar belonged to a lower grade of sanctity since it stood outside the Dwelling.
