All the holy things were to be covered; not only for security and respect, but to keep them from being seen. This not only marked the reverence due to holy things, but the mystery of the things signified by those types, and the darkness of the dispensation. But now, through Christ, the case is altered, and we are encouraged to come boldly to the throne of grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>wholly of blue - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a> note.

The only thing not mentioned is the copper laver (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>), probably because it was carried without any cover at all.
