This term includes, as is afterwards explained, the most holy things in the tabernacle, viz., the ark of the covenant, the table of shew-bread, the candlestick, the altar of incense and altar of burnt-offering, together with all the other things belonging to these. When the camp was broken up, the priests were to roll them up in wrappers, and hand them over in this state to the Kohathites, for them to carry (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5-15</a>). First of all (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-6.htm">Numbers 4:6</a>), Aaron and his sons were to take down the curtain between the holy place and the most holy (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-31.htm">Exodus 26:31</a>), and to cover the ark of testimony with it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>). Over this they were to place a wrapper of sea-cow skin (tachash, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-5.htm">Exodus 25:5</a>), and over this again another covering of cloth made entirely of hyacinth-coloured purple (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31</a>). The sea-cow skin as to protect the inner curtain, which was covered over the ark, from storm and rain; the hyacinth purple, to distinguish the ark of the covenant as the throne of the glory of Jehovah. Lastly, they were to place the staves into the rings again, that is to say, the bearing poles, which were always left in their places on the ark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-15.htm">Exodus 25:15</a>), but had necessarily to be taken out while it was being covered and wrapped up. </body></html>
