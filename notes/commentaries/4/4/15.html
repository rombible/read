The LXX. and the Samaritan text supply a statement respecting the covering and conveyance of the brazen laver. The clause in the LXX. is as follows :—“And they shall take a purple cloth, and cover the laver and its foot (or base), and they shall put it into a blue cover of skin, and put it on bars.” There is no sufficient ground. however, for supposing that the present Hebrew text is deficient in this place; and it seems more probable to suppose that the laver was not to be covered during its transport.<p><span class= "bld">After that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">to bear, or carry</span>—viz., the whole of the vessels of ministry which had been previously enumerated.
