The present census was with a view to the discharge of duties requiring a considerable amount of physical strength, and hence the prescribed age for entering upon these duties was fixed at this time at thirty, and limited to fifty. It has been supposed by some that five years were spent in preparation for the service, and that it is in this way that the apparent discrepancy between this verse and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm" title="This is it that belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service of the tabernacle of the congregation:">Numbers 8:24</a>, where the age for entering upon the service is fixed at twenty-five, is to be reconciled.

This is the full time of the Levites service, and the prime season of man's life for business; at thirty years of age he is at his full strength, and when fifty it begins to decline: it is said in the Misnah (x),"a son of thirty years for strength,''upon which one of the commentators (y) makes this remark, that the Levites set up the tabernacle and took it down, and loaded the wagons, and carried on their shoulders from thirty years and upwards: thus both John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ, and Christ himself, entered into their ministry at this age: <p>all that enter into the host; army or warfare; for though the Levites were exempted from going forth to war, yet their service was a sort of warfare; they were a camp of themselves about the tabernacle, and part of their work was to watch and guard it, that it was neither defiled nor robbed; in allusion to this, the ministry of the word is called a warfare, and ministers of the Gospel good soldiers of Christ, and their doctrines weapons of warfare, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>; some interpret this of the troop, company, or congregation of the Levites, which a man of thirty years of age was admitted into for business: <p>to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation; not in the sanctuary, either in the holy place or in the most holy place, where they were never allowed to enter, or do any business in, such as sacrificing, burning incense, &amp;c. but in that part of it which was called "the tabernacle of the congregation", or where the people assembled on occasion, and that was the court, which was so called, as Jarchi observes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-32.htm">Exodus 29:32</a>. <p>(x) Pirke Abot, c. 5. sect. 21.

In the wilderness a larger number of the men might be required to attend to their own camps, and their own families; but the explanation may probably be found in the unusually large proportion who were at this time between the ages of thirty and fifty. The Septuagint has altered thirty into twenty-five to make it agree with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24</a>. Thirty years became among the Jews the perfect age at which a man attained to full maturity, and entered upon all his fights and duties (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Into the host.</span> Not the military ranks, but the <span class="accented">militia sacra</span> of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">To do the work.</span> Literally, "to war the warfare." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this, Moses numbered the first-born of the children of Israel, to exchange them for the Levites according to the command of God, which is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-41.htm">Numbers 3:41</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-44.htm">Numbers 3:44-45</a> from <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-11.htm">Numbers 3:11-13</a>, and to adopt the latter in their stead for the service at the sanctuary (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-41.htm">Numbers 3:41</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-45.htm">Numbers 3:45</a>, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-11.htm">Numbers 3:11-13</a>). The number of the first-born of the twelve tribes amounted to 22,273 of a month old and upwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-43.htm">Numbers 3:43</a>). Of this number 22,000 were exchanged for the 22,000 Levites, and the cattle of the Levites were also set against the first-born of the cattle of the tribes of Israel, though without their being numbered and exchanged head for head. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-44.htm">Numbers 3:44</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-45.htm">Numbers 3:45</a> the command of God concerning the adoption of the Levites is repeated, for the purpose of adding the further instructions with regard to the 273, the number by which the first-born of the tribes exceeded those of the Levites. "And as for the redemption of the 273 (lit., the 273 to be redeemed) of the first-born of the children of Israel which were more than the Levites, thou shalt take five shekels a head," etc. This was the general price established by the law for the redemption of the first-born of men (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>). On the sacred shekel, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>. The redemption money for 273 first-born, in all 1365 shekels, was to be paid to Aaron and his sons as compensation for the persons who properly belonged to Jehovah, and had been appointed as first-born for the service of the priests. </body></html>
