The service of God requires the best of our strength, and the prime portion of our time, which cannot be better spent than to the honour of Him who is the First and Best. And the service of God should be done when we are most lively and active. Those do not consider this who put off repentance to old age, and so leave the best work to be done in the worst time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This redemption money (see the marginal references) would perhaps be exacted from the parents of the "youngest" children of the 22,273 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-43.htm">Numbers 3:43</a>.

The number of the first-born of the twelve tribes amounted to 22,273 of a month old and upwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-43.htm">Numbers 3:43</a>). Of this number 22,000 were exchanged for the 22,000 Levites, and the cattle of the Levites were also set against the first-born of the cattle of the tribes of Israel, though without their being numbered and exchanged head for head. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-44.htm">Numbers 3:44</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-45.htm">Numbers 3:45</a> the command of God concerning the adoption of the Levites is repeated, for the purpose of adding the further instructions with regard to the 273, the number by which the first-born of the tribes exceeded those of the Levites. "And as for the redemption of the 273 (lit., the 273 to be redeemed) of the first-born of the children of Israel which were more than the Levites, thou shalt take five shekels a head," etc. This was the general price established by the law for the redemption of the first-born of men (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>). On the sacred shekel, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>. The redemption money for 273 first-born, in all 1365 shekels, was to be paid to Aaron and his sons as compensation for the persons who properly belonged to Jehovah, and had been appointed as first-born for the service of the priests. </body></html>
