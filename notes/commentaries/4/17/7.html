Twelve rods or staves were to be brought in. It is probable that they were the staves which the princes used as ensigns of their authority; old dry staves, that had no sap in them. They were to expect that the rod of the tribe, or prince, whom God chose to the priesthood, should bud and blossom. Moses did not object that the matter was sufficiently settled already; he did not undertake to determine it; but left the case before the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The whole number of rods was twelve exclusive of Aaron's, as the Vulgate expressly states. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. the rod of Aaron was among their rods&#8212;either one of the twelve, or, as many suppose, a thirteenth in the midst (Heb 9:4).

In that part of the tabernacle where the testimony or witness was, that is, the law, which was in the ark, over which was the mercy seat, with the cherubim between which Jehovah dwelt, and this was the most holy place; and the rods being laid here, might be said to be laid before the Lord, who, by making a difference in one of those rods from the rest, would decide the controversy about the priesthood, which was the end of their being laid before him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the Lord,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in front of the ark. <span class="cmt_word">In the tabernacle of witness.</span> "In the tent of the testimony." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Or ch.17:16-28). Confirmation of the High-Priesthood of Aaron. - Whilst the Lord had thus given a practical proof to the people, that Aaron was the high priest appointed by Him for His congregation, by allowing the high-priestly incense offered by Aaron to expiate His wrath, and by removing the plague; He also gave them a still further confirmation of His priesthood, by a miracle which was well adapted to put to silence all the murmuring of the congregation.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-5</a><p>He commanded Moses to take twelve rods of the tribe-princes of Israel, one for the fathers' house of each of their tribes, and to write upon each the name of the tribe; but upon that of the tribe of Levi he was to write Aaron's name, because each rod was to stand for the head of their fathers' houses, i.e., for the existing head of the tribe; and in the case of Levi, the tribe-head was Aaron. As only twelve rods were taken for all the tribes of Israel, and Levi was included among them, Ephraim and Manasseh must have been reckoned as the one tribe of Joseph, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-12.htm">Deuteronomy 27:12</a>.

And there the rod of the man whom Jehovah chose, i.e., entrusted with the priesthood (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>), would put forth shoots, to quiet the murmuring of the people. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1498;, Hiph., to cause to sink, to bring to rest, construed with &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; in a pregnant signification, to quiet in such a way that it will not rise again.</body></html>
