Aaron's rod became a living branch. In some places there were buds, in others blossoms, in others fruit, at the same time; all this was miraculous. Thus Aaron was manifested to be under the special blessing of Heaven. Fruitfulness is the best evidence of a Divine call; and the plants of God's setting, and the boughs cut off them, will flourish. This rod was preserved, to take away the murmurings of the people, that they might not die. The design of God, in all his providences, and in the memorials of them, is to take away sin. Christ was manifested to take away sin. Christ is expressly called a rod out of the stem of Jesse: little prospect was there, according to human views, that he should ever flourish. But the dry rod revived and blossomed to the confusion of his adversaries. The people cry, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish! This was the language of a repining people, quarrelling with the judgments of God, which by their own pride and obstinacy they brought upon themselves. It is very wicked to fret against God when we are in affliction, and in our distress thus to trespass yet more. If we die, if we perish, it is of ourselves, and the blame will be upon our own heads. When God judges, he will overcome, and will oblige the most obstinate gainsayers to confess their folly. And how great are our mercies, that we have a clearer and a better dispensation, established upon better promises!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The testimony - i. e. the two tables of the Law; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a> note. No doubt the rod lay in front of the tables within the ark. In the days of Solomon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a> there was nothing in the ark save the Two tables. Aaron's rod was probably lost when the ark was taken by the Philistines. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels&#8212;For if, after all admonitions and judgments, seconded by miracles, the people should still rebel, they would certainly pay the penalty by death.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses did so; as the Lord commanded him, even so did he.

Confirmation of the High-Priesthood of Aaron. - Whilst the Lord had thus given a practical proof to the people, that Aaron was the high priest appointed by Him for His congregation, by allowing the high-priestly incense offered by Aaron to expiate His wrath, and by removing the plague; He also gave them a still further confirmation of His priesthood, by a miracle which was well adapted to put to silence all the murmuring of the congregation.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/17-1.htm">Numbers 17:1-5</a><p>He commanded Moses to take twelve rods of the tribe-princes of Israel, one for the fathers' house of each of their tribes, and to write upon each the name of the tribe; but upon that of the tribe of Levi he was to write Aaron's name, because each rod was to stand for the head of their fathers' houses, i.e., for the existing head of the tribe; and in the case of Levi, the tribe-head was Aaron. As only twelve rods were taken for all the tribes of Israel, and Levi was included among them, Ephraim and Manasseh must have been reckoned as the one tribe of Joseph, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-12.htm">Deuteronomy 27:12</a>.

And there the rod of the man whom Jehovah chose, i.e., entrusted with the priesthood (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>), would put forth shoots, to quiet the murmuring of the people. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1498;, Hiph., to cause to sink, to bring to rest, construed with &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; in a pregnant signification, to quiet in such a way that it will not rise again.</body></html>
