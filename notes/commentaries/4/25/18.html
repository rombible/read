We see here that we have more to fear from our passions than from the malice of our enemies, and that it is a very dangerous thing to suffer ourselves to be seduced by voluptuousness and the desires of the flesh. This is the application which St. Paul makes of this history in the passage above referred to; where he tells us that “these things were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.” Again, the zeal which Moses and Phinehas showed on this occasion, and God’s rewarding Phinehas, prove that we must zealously oppose, by all just and lawful means, those that offend God openly; that this is in particular the duty of magistrates and ministers of religion; and that God rewards the fidelity of those who thus express their zeal for his glory.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:16-18 We read not that any Midianites died of the plague; God punished them with the sword of an enemy, not with the rod of a father. We must set ourselves against whatever is an occasion of sin to us, Mt 5:29,30. Whatever draws us to sin, should be a vexation to us, as a thorn in the flesh. And none will be more surely and severely punished than those who, after Satan's example, and with his subtlety, tempt others to sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My covenant of peace - Equivalent to "the covenant of My peace." God established with Phinehas in particular that covenant which He had made generally with all his people; and among its blessings peace is especially mentioned, because of the peace between God and the congregation which Phinehas had brought about. As an additional gift there is assigned to him and his seed forever the office of peace-making, the legitimate function of the priesthood (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>); and the covenant was thus to him a covenant not only of peace but of life (compare the marginal reference). Phinehas became highpriest after the death of his father Eleazar, and the office, with a short interruption from the days of Eli to those of David, when for unknown reasons it was filled by the descendants of his uncle Ithamar, was perpetuated in his line; nor indeed is it known to have departed from that line again until the typical priesthood of the sons of Aaron was merged in the actual priesthood of the Saviour of mankind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. they vex you with their wiles&#8212;Instead of open war, they plot insidious ways of accomplishing your ruin by idolatry and corruption.<p>their sister&#8212;their countrywoman.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> For under pretence of kindred, and friendship, and leagues, yea, and marriages, which they offered to them, instead of that war which the Israelites expected from them, they sought only an opportunity to insinuate themselves into their familiarity, and execute their hellish plot of bringing that curse upon the Israelites, which they had in vain attempted to bring another way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi; </span> by drawing you both to spiritual and corporal whoredom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Their sister, </span> in a large sense, to wit, their countrywoman. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For they vex you with their wiles,....

By doing this he had averted destruction from the Israelites, and restrained the working of Jehovah's zeal, which had manifested itself in the plague. "I gave him my covenant of peace" (the suffix is attached to the governing noun, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-2.htm">Genesis 17:2</a>, to give, i.e., to fulfil the covenant, to grant what was promised in the covenant. The covenant granted to Phinehas consisted in the fact, that an "eternal priesthood" (i.e., the eternal possession of the priesthood) was secured to him, not for himself alone, but for his descendants also, as a covenant, i.e., in a covenant, or irrevocable form, since God never breaks a covenant that He has made. In accordance with this promise, the high-priesthood which passed from Eleazar to Phinehas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>) continued in his family, with the exception of a brief interruption in Eli's days (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1.htm">1 Samuel 1-3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>), until the time of the last gradual dissolution of the Jewish state through the tyranny of Herod and his successors (see my Archologie, 38). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-14.htm">Numbers 25:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-15.htm">Numbers 25:15</a>, the names of the two daring sinners are given. The father of Cozbi, the Midianitish princess, was named Zur, and is described here as "head of the tribes (&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>) of a father's house in Midian," i.e., as the head of several of the Midianitish tribes that were descended from one tribe-father; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>, however, he is described as a king, and classed among the five kings of Midian who were slain by the Israelites. </body></html>
