Presuming, however, that there has been no error in either place on the part of the scribes in recording the numbers, the words “in one day” may account for the apparent discrepancy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-9.htm" title="And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.">Numbers 25:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">Twenty and four thousand — </span>St. Paul mentions only <span class="ital">twenty and three thousand, </span>who, he says, fell in one day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-8.htm" title="Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>.

As the Septuagint does not deviate here from the Hebrew, the Apostle must have followed some Rabbinical tradition. It is possible enough that the odd thousand died on some other day than the one of which he speaks, or they may have died by the hands of the judges, and not by the plague. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And the anger of the Lord burned against the people, so that Jehovah commanded Moses to fetch the heads of the people, i.e., to assemble them together, and to "hang up" the men who had joined themselves to Baal-Peor "before the Lord against the sun," that the anger of God might turn away from Israel. The burning of the wrath of God, which was to be turned away from the people by the punishment of the guilty, as enjoined upon Moses, consisted, as we may see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9</a>, in a plague inflicted upon the nation, which carried off a great number of the people, a sudden death, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-37.htm">Numbers 14:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-11.htm">Numbers 17:11</a>. &#1492;&#1493;&#1511;&#1497;&#1506;, from &#1497;&#1511;&#1506;, to be torn apart or torn away (Ges., Winer), refers to the punishment of crucifixion, a mode of capital punishment which was adopted by most of the nations of antiquity (see Winer, bibl. R. W. i. p. 680), and was carried out sometimes by driving a stake into the body, and so impaling them (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;), the mode practised by the Assyrians and Persians (Herod. iii. 159, and Layard's Nineveh and its Remains, vol. ii. p. 374, and plate on p. 369), at other times by fastening them to a stake or nailing them to a cross (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;). In the instance before us, however, the idolaters were not impaled or crucified alive, but, as we may see from the word &#1492;&#1512;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-5.htm">Numbers 25:5</a>, and in accordance with the custom frequently adopted by other nations (see Herzog's Encyclopaedia), they were first of all put to death, and then impaled upon a stake or fastened upon a cross, so that the impaling or crucifixion was only an aggravation of the capital punishment, like the burning in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>, and the hanging (&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22</a>.
