Bring the tribe of Levi near&#8212;The Hebrew word "bring near" is a sacrificial term, denoting the presentation of an offering to God; and the use of the word, therefore, in connection with the Levites, signifies that they were devoted as an offering to the sanctuary, no longer to be employed in any common offices. They were subordinate to the priests, who alone enjoyed the privilege of entering the holy place; but they were employed in discharging many of the humbler duties which belonged to the sanctuary, as well as in various offices of great utility and importance to the religion and morals of the people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His charge, </span> i.e. Aaron’s charge, or those things which are committed principally to Aaron’s care and oversight, and under him and his direction to the Levites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the whole congregation, </span> i.e. of all the sacrifices and services which are due to the Lord from all the people, and because all the people could not and might not perform them, or at least divers of them, in their own persons, therefore they were to be performed by some particular persons in their name and stead; formerly by the first-born, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-16.htm" title="For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them to me.">Numbers 8:16</a></span>, and now by the Levites.

The charge of Aaron and of all the people of Israel, which was to secure the sanctuary from being polluted or plundered: this the Levites were to be employed about, and thereby ease the high priest and the other priests, and the people, of what otherwise would have been incumbent on them: <p>before the tabernacle of the congregation; not within it, neither in the holy place, nor in the most holy place, where they might not enter, to do any service peculiar thereunto, but at the door of the tabernacle, and in the court of it, and in the rooms and chambers in it: and do the service of the tabernacle; not to offer sacrifices on the altar of the burnt offering, which stood in the court, and much less to burn incense on the altar of incense, and to him the lamps, and set on the shewbread in the holy place; and still less to enter into the most holy place, and do there what was to be done on the day of atonement; but to do all that is before observed, and to bring the people's offerings to the priest, and to assist in slaying them; and to keep all profane and polluted persons out of it, the tabernacle, as we find in later times; they were porters at it, and some of them were singers in it, and had the care of various things belonging to it: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-14.htm">1 Chronicles 9:14</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle.</span><p>(e) Which belonged to the executing of the high priests commandment, to the oversight of the people, and the service of the tabernacle.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">keep his charge</span>] i.e. perform the duties of their service to him and to the priests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the charge of the whole congregation</span>] comprised the ritual functions in connexion with the offering of animals sacrificed by and in behalf of the laity of Israel.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation.</span> Septuagint, "shall keep his watches, and the watches of the children of Israel." The Levites were to be the servants of Aaron on the one side, and of the whole congregation on the other, in the performance of their religious duties. The complicated ceremonial now prescribed and set in use could not possibly be carried out by priests or people without the assistance of a large number of persons trained and devoted to the work. Compare St. Paul's words to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>), "Ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In order to indicate at the very outset the position which the Levites were to occupy in relation to the priests (viz., Aaron and his descendants), the account of their muster commences not only with the enumeration of the sons of Aaron who were chosen as priests (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/3-2.htm">Numbers 3:2-4</a>), but with the heading: "These are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day (i.e., at the time) when Jehovah spake with Moses in Mount Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-1.htm">Numbers 3:1</a>). The toledoth (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>) of Moses and Aaron are not only the families which sprang from Aaron and Moses, but the Levitical families generally, which were named after Aaron and Moses, because they were both of them raised into the position of heads or spiritual fathers of the whole tribe, namely, at the time when God spoke to Moses upon Sinai. Understood in this way, the notice as to the time is neither a superfluous repetition, nor introduced with reference to the subsequent numbering of the people in the steppes of Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-57.htm">Numbers 26:57</a>.). Aaron is placed before Moses here (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-26.htm">Exodus 6:26</a>.), not merely as being the elder of the two, but because his sons received the priesthood, whilst the sons of Moses, on the contrary, were classed among the rest of the Levitical families (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-14.htm">1 Chronicles 23:14</a>).</body></html>
