Known unto God are all his works beforehand; there is an exact proportion between them, and so it will appear, when they are compared together. The small number of first-born, over and above the number of the Levites, were to be redeemed, and the redemption-money given to Aaron. The church is called the church of the first-born, which is redeemed, not as they were, with silver and gold; but, being devoted by sin to the justice of God, is ransomed with the precious blood of the Son of God. All men are the Lord's by creation, and all true christians are his by redemption. Each should know his own post and duty; nor can any service required by such a Master be rightly accounted mean or hard.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This redemption money (see the marginal references) would perhaps be exacted from the parents of the "youngest" children of the 22,273 <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-43.htm">Numbers 3:43</a>.

In consequence of this exchange the firstlings were not brought then, as afterwards, to the altar and the priests.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake unto Moses,....
