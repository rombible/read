The word <span class= "ital">ohel, </span>where it occurs in the second place in this verse, evidently means the outer covering, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-7.htm" title="And you shall make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering on the tabernacle: eleven curtains shall you make.">Exodus 26:7</a>, where the passage may be literally rendered thus :—“And thou shalt make curtains (or hangings) of goats’ (hair) for an <span class= "ital">ohel </span>upon (or over) the <span class= "ital">mishkan.”</span><p><span class= "bld">The covering thereof.—</span>The <span class= "ital">mikseh </span>(covering) appears to include the two coverings described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-14.htm" title="And you shall make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.">Exodus 26:14</a>—viz., the covering of rams’ skins and that of badgers’ skins or seals’ skins.<p><span class= "bld">The hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., for the entrance or opening of the tent of meeting. </span>This hanging was of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine-twined linen, and was hung at the entrance—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the eastern or open end of the tent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-36.htm" title="And you shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework.">Exodus 26:36</a>). The word rendered door (<span class= "ital">pethach, </span>not <span class= "ital">deleth</span>) means an opening.

The posterity of Moses were not at all honoured or privileged, but stood upon the level with other Levites; thus it was plain, that Moses did not seek the advancement of his own family, or to secure any honours to it. The tribe of Levi was by much the least of all the tribes.

Number the children of Levi&#8212;They were numbered as well as the other tribes; but the enumeration was made on a different principle&#8212;for while in the other tribes the number of males was calculated from twenty years and upward [Nu 1:3], in that of Levi they were counted "from a month old and upward." The reason for the distinction is obvious. In the other tribes the survey was made for purposes of war [Nu 1:3], from which the Levites were totally exempt. But the Levites were appointed to a work on which they entered as soon as they were capable of instruction. They are mentioned under the names of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, sons of Levi, and chiefs or ancestral heads of three subdivisions into which this tribe was distributed. Their duties were to assist in the conveyance of the tabernacle when the people were removing the various encampments, and to form its guard while stationary&#8212;the Gershonites being stationed on the west, the Kohathites on the south, and the families of Merari on the north. The Kohathites had the principal place about the tabernacle, and charge of the most precious and sacred things&#8212;a distinction with which they were honored, probably, because the Aaronic family belonged to this division of the Levitical tribe. The Gershonites, being the oldest, had the next honorable post assigned them, while the burden of the drudgery was thrown on the division of Merari.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The tabernacle; </span> not the boards, which belonged to Merari, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-36.htm" title="And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serves thereto,">Numbers 3:36</a></span>, but the ten curtains mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-1.htm" title="Moreover you shall make the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubim of cunning work shall you make them.">Exodus 26:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The tent, </span> to wit, the curtains of goats’ hair. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The covering thereof, </span> i.e. the coverings of rams’ skins and badgers’ skins.
