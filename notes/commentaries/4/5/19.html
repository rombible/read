On the other hand, it would hinder the cruel treatment such suspicions might occasion. It would also hinder the guilty from escaping, and the innocent from coming under just suspicion. When no proof could be brought, the wife was called on to make this solemn appeal to a heart-searching God. No woman, if she were guilty, could say Amen to the adjuration, and drink the water after it, unless she disbelieved the truth of God, or defied his justice. The water is called the bitter water, because it caused the curse. Thus sin is called an evil and a bitter thing. Let all that meddle with forbidden pleasures, know that they will be bitterness in the latter end. From the whole learn, 1. Secret sins are known to God, and sometimes are strangely brought to light in this life; and that there is a day coming when God will, by Christ, judge the secrets of men according to the gospel, Ro 2:16. 2 In particular, Whoremongers and adulterers God will surely judge. Though we have not now the waters of jealousy, yet we have God's word, which ought to be as great a terror. Sensual lusts will end in bitterness. 3. God will manifest the innocency of the innocent. The same providence is for good to some, and for hurt to others. And it will answer the purposes which God intends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Gone aside ... - literally, "gone astray from" thy husband by uncleanness; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17, 18. the priest shall take holy water&#8212;Water from the laver, which was to be mixed with dust&#8212;an emblem of vileness and misery (Ge 3:14; Ps 22:15).<p>in an earthen vessel&#8212;This fragile ware was chosen because, after being used, it was broken in pieces (Le 6:28; 11:33).

As the woman's crime, of which her husband accused her, was naturally denied by herself, and was neither to be supported by witnesses nor proved by her being taken in the very act, the only way left to determine whether there was any foundation or not for the spirit of jealousy excited in her husband, and to prevent an unrighteous severance of the divinely appointed marriage, was to let the thing be decided by the verdict of God Himself. To this end the man was to bring his wife to the priest with a sacrificial gift, which is expressly called &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468;, her offering, brought &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492; "on her account," that is to say, with a meat-offering, the symbol of the fruit of her walk and conduct before God. Being the sacrificial gift of a wife who had gone aside and was suspected of adultery, this meat-offering could not possess the character of the ordinary meat-offerings, which shadowed forth the fruit of the sanctification of life in good works; could not consist, that is to say, of fine wheaten flour, but only of barley meal. Barley was worth only half as much as wheat (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-16.htm">2 Kings 7:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-18.htm">2 Kings 7:18</a>), so that only the poorer classes, or the people generally in times of great distress, used barley meal as their daily food (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-13.htm">John 6:13</a>), whilst those who were better off used it for fodder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8</a>). Barley meal was prescribed for this sacrifice, neither as a sign that the adulteress had conducted herself like an irrational animal (Philo, Jonathan, Talm., the Rabb., etc.), nor "because the persons presenting the offering were invoking the punishment of a crime, and not the favour of God" (Cler., Ros.): for the guilt of a woman was not yet established; nor even, taking a milder view of the matter, to indicate that the offerer might be innocent, and in that case no offering at all was required Knobel), but to represent the questionable repute in which the woman stood, or the ambiguous, suspicious character of her conduct. Because such conduct as hers did not proceed from the Spirit of God, and was not carried out in prayer: oil and incense, the symbols of the Spirit of God and prayer, were not to be added to her offering. It was an offering of jealousy (&#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1514;, an intensive plural), and the object was to bring the ground of that jealousy to light; and in this respect it is called the "meat-offering of remembrance," sc., of the woman, before Jehovah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-54.htm">Numbers 31:54</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-12.htm">Exodus 28:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-29.htm">Exodus 28:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-16.htm">Exodus 30:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>), namely, "the remembrance of iniquity," bringing her crime to remembrance before the Lord, that it might be judged by Him.</body></html>
