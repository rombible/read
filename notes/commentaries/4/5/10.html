The purity of the church must be kept as carefully as the peace and order of it. Every polluted Israelite must be separated. The wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable. The greater profession of religion any house or family makes, the more they are obliged to put away iniquity far from them. If a man overreach or defraud his brother in any matter, it is a trespass against the Lord, who strictly charges and commands us to do justly. What is to be done when a man's awakened conscience charges him with guilt of this kind, though done long ago? He must confess his sin, confess it to God, confess it to his neighbour, and take shame to himself; though it go against him to own himself in a lie, yet he must do it. Satisfaction must be made for the offence done to God, as well as for the loss sustained by the neighbour; restitution in that case is not enough without faith and repentance. While that which is wrongly gotten is knowingly kept, the guilt remains on the conscience, and is not done away by sacrifice or offering, prayers or tears; for it is the same act of sin persisted in. This is the doctrine of right reason, and of the word of God. It detects hypocrites, and directs the tender conscience to proper conduct, which, springing from faith in Christ, will make way for inward peace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And every man's hallowed things shall be his - i. e. the priest's.

It is in the spirit of covetousness which underlies all such conduct that we are to find the connection between these two verses and the rest of the paragraph.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 5:12-27 THE TRIAL OF JEALOUSY (verses 11-31). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Removal of Unclean Persons out of the Camp. - As Jehovah, the Holy One, dwelt in the midst of the camp of His people, those who were affected with the uncleanness of leprosy (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13</a>), of a diseased flux, or of menstruation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>.), and those who had become unclean through touching a corpse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11</a>., cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-4.htm">Leviticus 22:4</a>), whether male or female, were to be removed out of the camp, that they might not defile it by their uncleanness.
