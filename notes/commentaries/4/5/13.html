On the other hand, it would hinder the cruel treatment such suspicions might occasion. It would also hinder the guilty from escaping, and the innocent from coming under just suspicion. When no proof could be brought, the wife was called on to make this solemn appeal to a heart-searching God. No woman, if she were guilty, could say Amen to the adjuration, and drink the water after it, unless she disbelieved the truth of God, or defied his justice. The water is called the bitter water, because it caused the curse. Thus sin is called an evil and a bitter thing. Let all that meddle with forbidden pleasures, know that they will be bitterness in the latter end. From the whole learn, 1. Secret sins are known to God, and sometimes are strangely brought to light in this life; and that there is a day coming when God will, by Christ, judge the secrets of men according to the gospel, Ro 2:16. 2 In particular, Whoremongers and adulterers God will surely judge. Though we have not now the waters of jealousy, yet we have God's word, which ought to be as great a terror. Sensual lusts will end in bitterness. 3. God will manifest the innocency of the innocent. The same providence is for good to some, and for hurt to others. And it will answer the purposes which God intends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The trial of jealousy. Since the crime of adultery is especially defiling and destructive of the very foundations of social order, the whole subject is dealt with at a length proportionate to its importance. The process prescribed has lately been strikingly illustrated from an Egyptian "romance," which refers to the time of Rameses the Great, and may therefore well serve to illustrate the manners and customs of the Mosaic times. This mode of trial, like several other ordinances, was adopted by Moses from existing and probably very ancient and widely spread institutions.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-15. if any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him&#8212;This law was given both as a strong discouragement to conjugal infidelity on the part of a wife, and a sufficient protection of her from the consequences of a hasty and groundless suspicion on the part of the husband. His suspicions, however, were sufficient in the absence of witnesses (Le 20:10) to warrant the trial described; and the course of proceeding to be followed was for the jealous husband to bring his wife unto the priest with an offering of barley meal, because none were allowed to approach the sanctuary empty handed (Ex 23:15). On other occasions, there were mingled with the offering, oil which signified joy, and frankincense which denoted acceptance (Ps 141:2). But on the occasion referred to, both these ingredients were to be excluded, partly because it was a solemn appeal to God in distressing circumstances, and partly because it was a sin offering on the part of the wife, who came before God in the character of a real or suspected offender.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> She utterly denying it, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-20.htm" title="Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eats, and wipes her mouth, and said, I have done no wickedness.">Proverbs 30:20</a></span>, and none being able and willing to discover it; for if it was witnessed, she was to die for it, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm" title="And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 20:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm" title="If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shall you put away evil from Israel.">Deu 22:22</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And a man lie with her carnally,....

"If a man or a woman do one of the sins of men, to commit unfaithfulness against Jehovah, and the same soul has incurred guilt, they shall confess their sin which they have done, and (the doer) shall recompense his debt according to its sum" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>), etc. &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;, one of the sins occurring among men, not "a sin against a man" (Luther, Ros., etc.). The meaning is a sin, with which a &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; was committed against Jehovah, i.e., one of the acts described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3-4</a>, by which injury was done to the property of a neighbour, whereby a man brought a debt upon himself, for the wiping out of which a material restitution of the other's property was prescribed, together with the addition of a fifth of its value, and also the presentation of a sin-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4-7</a>). To guard against that disturbance of fellowship and peace in the congregation, which would arise from such trespasses as these, the law already given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-1.htm">Leviticus 6:1</a> is here renewed and supplemented by the additional stipulation, that if the man who had been unjustly deprived of some of his property had no Gol, to whom restitution could be made for the debt, the compensation should be paid to Jehovah for the priests. The Gol was the nearest relative, upon whom the obligation rested to redeem a person who had fallen into slavery through poverty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). The allusion to the Gol in this connection presupposes that the injured person was no longer alive. To this there are appended, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-9.htm">Numbers 5:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/5-10.htm">Numbers 5:10</a>, the directions which are substantially connected with this, viz., that every heave-offering (Terumah, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>) in the holy gifts of the children of Israel, which they presented to the priest, was to belong to him (the priest), and also all the holy gifts which were brought by different individuals. The reference is not to literal sacrifices, i.e., gifts intended for the altar, but to dedicatory offerings, first-fruits, and such like. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, "with regard to every man's, his holy gifts...to him (the priest) shall they be; what any man gives to the priest shall belong to him." The second clause serves to explain and confirm the first. &#1488;&#1514;: as far, with regard to, quoad (see Ewald, 277, d; Ges. 117, 2, note). </body></html>
