On the other hand, it would hinder the cruel treatment such suspicions might occasion. It would also hinder the guilty from escaping, and the innocent from coming under just suspicion. When no proof could be brought, the wife was called on to make this solemn appeal to a heart-searching God. No woman, if she were guilty, could say Amen to the adjuration, and drink the water after it, unless she disbelieved the truth of God, or defied his justice. The water is called the bitter water, because it caused the curse. Thus sin is called an evil and a bitter thing. Let all that meddle with forbidden pleasures, know that they will be bitterness in the latter end. From the whole learn, 1. Secret sins are known to God, and sometimes are strangely brought to light in this life; and that there is a day coming when God will, by Christ, judge the secrets of men according to the gospel, Ro 2:16. 2 In particular, Whoremongers and adulterers God will surely judge. Though we have not now the waters of jealousy, yet we have God's word, which ought to be as great a terror. Sensual lusts will end in bitterness. 3. God will manifest the innocency of the innocent. The same providence is for good to some, and for hurt to others. And it will answer the purposes which God intends.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The trial of jealousy. Since the crime of adultery is especially defiling and destructive of the very foundations of social order, the whole subject is dealt with at a length proportionate to its importance. The process prescribed has lately been strikingly illustrated from an Egyptian "romance," which refers to the time of Rameses the Great, and may therefore well serve to illustrate the manners and customs of the Mosaic times. This mode of trial, like several other ordinances, was adopted by Moses from existing and probably very ancient and widely spread institutions.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-15. if any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him&#8212;This law was given both as a strong discouragement to conjugal infidelity on the part of a wife, and a sufficient protection of her from the consequences of a hasty and groundless suspicion on the part of the husband. His suspicions, however, were sufficient in the absence of witnesses (Le 20:10) to warrant the trial described; and the course of proceeding to be followed was for the jealous husband to bring his wife unto the priest with an offering of barley meal, because none were allowed to approach the sanctuary empty handed (Ex 23:15). On other occasions, there were mingled with the offering, oil which signified joy, and frankincense which denoted acceptance (Ps 141:2). But on the occasion referred to, both these ingredients were to be excluded, partly because it was a solemn appeal to God in distressing circumstances, and partly because it was a sin offering on the part of the wife, who came before God in the character of a real or suspected offender.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This law was given partly to deter wives from adulterous practices, and partly to secure wives against the rage of their hard-hearted husbands, who otherwise might upon mere suspicions destroy them, or at least put them away. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Quest.</span> Why was there not the same law for the trial of the husband, when the wife was jealous of him? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> This might be either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

It being an affair which concerned them: <p>if any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him; the sin of adultery, which is a going aside out of the way of virtue and chastity, and a trespass against an husband, a breach of the marriage covenant with him, a defiling his bed, doing an injury and dishonour to him, bringing confusion into his family, and a spurious offspring to possess his substance: though this is to be understood, not of certain adultery, of which there is plain and full proof, for then there would be no occasion of such a trial, as is afterwards directed to; besides, her husband, in such a case, might put her away, and even, according to the law, she was to be put to death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; but of her having committed it in the opinion of her husband, he having some ground of suspicion, though he could not be certain of it; and therefore, by this law, was allowed to make trial, that he might find it out, it at present only a suspected case, and a doubtful one; and the Jews (k) say,"they never gave the waters drink but in a doubtful case:''and so this may interpreted of her declining and departing from her husband's house, not keeping at home to mind the affairs of her family, but gadding abroad, and keeping company with another man, or other men; and that after she had been warned and charged by her husband to the contrary, and so had disobeyed him, and acted contrary to his will; and in that sense had committed a trespass, and so had given him suspicion of her unchastity, for which he might have some reason; if, as it is said in the Misnah (l), he gave her an admonition before two witnesses, saying, have no talk with such a man, and yet she talks with him; or, as the commentators add (m), be not secretly or in private with such an one, and yet goes into a private place with him, and stays so long with him that she may be defiled; this with them rendered her suspected. <p>(k) Bemidbar Rabba, sect. 9. fol. 195. 2.((l) Sotah, c. 1. sect. 1, 2.((m) Maimon. &amp; Bartenora in Misn.

The punishment of adultery as a sin had been already prescribed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Restitution in Case of a Trespass. - No crime against the property of a neighbour was to remain without expiation in the congregation of Israel, which was encamped or dwelt around the sanctuary of Jehovah; and the wrong committed was not to remain without restitution, because such crimes involved unfaithfulness (&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>) towards Jehovah. "If a man or a woman do one of the sins of men, to commit unfaithfulness against Jehovah, and the same soul has incurred guilt, they shall confess their sin which they have done, and (the doer) shall recompense his debt according to its sum" (&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>), etc. &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; &#1502;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1496;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;, one of the sins occurring among men, not "a sin against a man" (Luther, Ros., etc.). The meaning is a sin, with which a &#1502;&#1506;&#1500; was committed against Jehovah, i.e., one of the acts described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3-4</a>, by which injury was done to the property of a neighbour, whereby a man brought a debt upon himself, for the wiping out of which a material restitution of the other's property was prescribed, together with the addition of a fifth of its value, and also the presentation of a sin-offering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4-7</a>). To guard against that disturbance of fellowship and peace in the congregation, which would arise from such trespasses as these, the law already given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-1.htm">Leviticus 6:1</a> is here renewed and supplemented by the additional stipulation, that if the man who had been unjustly deprived of some of his property had no Gol, to whom restitution could be made for the debt, the compensation should be paid to Jehovah for the priests. The Gol was the nearest relative, upon whom the obligation rested to redeem a person who had fallen into slavery through poverty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). The allusion to the Gol in this connection presupposes that the injured person was no longer alive. To this there are appended, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-9.htm">Numbers 5:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/5-10.htm">Numbers 5:10</a>, the directions which are substantially connected with this, viz., that every heave-offering (Terumah, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-9.htm">Leviticus 2:9</a>) in the holy gifts of the children of Israel, which they presented to the priest, was to belong to him (the priest), and also all the holy gifts which were brought by different individuals. The reference is not to literal sacrifices, i.e., gifts intended for the altar, but to dedicatory offerings, first-fruits, and such like. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, "with regard to every man's, his holy gifts...to him (the priest) shall they be; what any man gives to the priest shall belong to him." The second clause serves to explain and confirm the first. &#1488;&#1514;: as far, with regard to, quoad (see Ewald, 277, d; Ges. 117, 2, note). </body></html>
