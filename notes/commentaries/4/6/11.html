Some were appointed of God, before their birth, to be Nazarites all their days, as Samson and John the Baptist. But, in general, it was a vow of separation from the world and devotedness to the services of religion, for a limited time, and under certain rules, which any person might make if they pleased. A Nazarite is spoken of as well known; but his obligation is brought to a greater certainty than before. That the fancies of superstitious men might not multiply the restraints endlessly, God gives them rules. They must not drink wine or strong drink, nor eat grapes. Those who separate themselves to God, must not gratify the desires of the body, but keep it under. Let all Christians be very moderate in the use of wine and strong drink; for if the love of these once gets the mastery of a man, he becomes an easy prey to Satan. The Nazarites were to eat nothing that came of the vine; this may teach the utmost care to avoid sin, and all that borders upon it, and leads to it, or may be a temptation to us. They must not cut their hair. They must neither poll their heads, nor shave their beards; this was the mark of Samson being a Nazarite. This signified neglect of the body, and of the ease and ornament of it. Those who separate themselves to God, must keep their consciences pure from dead works, and not touch unclean things. All the days of their separation they must be holy to the Lord. This was the meaning of those outward observances, and without this they were of no account. No penalty or sacrifice was appointed for those who wilfully broke their vow of being Nazarites; they must answer another day for such profane trifling with the Lord their God; but those were to be relieved who did not sin wilfully. There is nothing in Scripture that bears the least resemblance to the religious orders of the church of Rome, except these Nazarites. But mark the difference, or rather how completely opposed! The religious of that church are forbidden to marry; but no such restriction is laid upon the Nazarites. They are commanded to abstain from meats; but the Nazarites might eat any food allowed other Israelites. They are not generally forbidden wine, not even on their fasting days; but the Nazarites might not have wine at any time. Their vow is lasting, even to the end of their lives; the Nazarites' vow was only for a limited time, at their own will; and in certain cases not unless allowed by husbands or parents. Such a thorough difference there is between rules of man's invention and those directed in Scripture, Let us not forget that the Lord Jesus is not only our Surety, but also our example. For his sake we must renounce worldly pleasures, abstain from fleshy lusts, be separate from sinners, make open profession of our faith, moderate natural affections, be spiritually-minded, and devoted to God's service, and desirous to be an example all around us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Prescriptions to meet the case of a sudden death taking place "by him" (i. e. in his presence).

If any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of his consecration&#8212;Cases of sudden death might occur to make him contract pollution; and in such circumstances he was required, after shaving his head, to make the prescribed offerings necessary for the removal of ceremonial defilement (Le 15:13; Nu 19:11). But by the terms of this law an accidental defilement vitiated the whole of his previous observances, and he was required to begin the period of his Nazaritism afresh. But even this full completion did not supersede the necessity of a sin offering at the close. Sin mingles with our best and holiest performances, and the blood of sprinkling is necessary to procure acceptance to us and our services.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall offer, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">make</span>, which is oft put for <span class="ital">sacrificing</span> or <span class="ital">offering</span>, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-36.htm" title="And you shall offer every day a bullock for a sin offering for atonement: and you shall cleanse the altar, when you have made an atonement for it, and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.">Exodus 29:36</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-23.htm" title="And Ornan said to David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: see, I give you the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.">1 Chronicles 21:23</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-22.htm" title="And Araunah said to David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him: behold, here be oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood.">2 Samuel 24:22</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For a sin-offering, </span> because such a pollution was, though not his sin, yet the chastisement of his sin, and had an appearance of sin, to wit, of negligence in not standing sufficiently upon his guard, which in such persons was in a manner equivalent to a sin.

Till the days were fulfilled which he had consecrated to the Lord, he was to be holy, "to make great the free growth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>) of the hair of his head." The free growth of the hair is called, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-7.htm">Numbers 6:7</a>, "the diadem of his God upon his head," like the golden diadem upon the turban of the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>), and the anointing oil upon the high priest's head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-12.htm">Leviticus 21:12</a>). By this he sanctified his head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-11.htm">Numbers 6:11</a>) to the Lord, so that the consecration of the Nazarite culminated in his uncut hair, and expressed in the most perfect way the meaning of his vow (Oehler). Letting the hair grow, therefore, was not a sign of separation, because it was the Israelitish custom to go about with the hair cut; nor a practical profession of a renunciation of the world, and separation from human society (Hengstenberg, pp. 190-1); nor a sign of abstinence from every appearance of self-gratification (Baur on <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-11.htm">Amos 2:11</a>); nor even a kind of humiliation and self-denial (Lightfoot, Carpzov. appar. p. 154); still less a "sign of dependence upon some other present power" (M. Baumgarten), or "the symbol of a state of perfect liberty" (Vitringa, obss. <a href="http://biblehub.com/songs/1.htm">Songs 1</a>, c. 6, 9; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-8.htm">Numbers 6:8</a>). The free growth of the hair, unhindered by the hand of man, was rather "the symbol of strength and abundant vitality" (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25-26</a>). It was not regarded by the Hebrews as a sign of sanctity, as Bhr supposes, but simply as an ornament, in which the whole strength and fulness of vitality were exhibited, and which the Nazarite wore in honour of the Lord, as a sign that he "belonged to the Lord, and dedicated himself to His service," with all his vital powers.<p>(Note: In support of this explanation, Oehler calls to mind those heathen hair-offerings of the Athenian youths, for example (Plut. Thes. c. 5), which were founded upon the idea, that the hair in general was a symbol of vital power, and the hair of the beard a sign of virility; and also more especially the example of Samson, whose hair was not only the symbol, but the vehicle, of the power which fitted him to be the deliverer of his people.)</body></html>
