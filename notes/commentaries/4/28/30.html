No hurrying employments, or perilous situations, or prosperous circumstances, should cause slackness in our religious exercises; but should rather stir us up to greater diligence in seeking help from, or giving thanks to the Lord. And all is to be accompanied with repentance, faith is the Lord Jesus, and love to him, and to produce true holiness in our conduct towards all men; otherwise God will abhor our most solemn services and abundant devotions. And Christ is able to supply the wants of every day, every week, every month, every year, every ordinance, every case.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The festival offering at the season of first-fruits was to be offered on one day only; and was the same with that of the new moon and Passover.

This implies that the festal sacrifices commanded were to be prepared and offered every day after the morning sacrifice. </body></html>
