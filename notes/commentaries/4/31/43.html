Out of the people's share God required one in fifty, but out of the soldiers' share only one in five hundred. The less opportunity we have of honouring God with personal services, the more should we give in money or value.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-11.htm">Numbers 31:11</a>, and render "And the prey" (i. e., the live prey) "in addition to the spoil which the men of war seized, etc." The "spoil" is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-50.htm">Numbers 31:50</a>.<p>The number of sheep, beeves, asses, and persons taken is given in this and following verses in round thousands.

The enormous amount both of live stock and of personal ornament was characteristic of the Midianites. When they invaded Israel in the days of the Judges, their wealth was still of the same kind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-5.htm">Judges 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-24.htm">Judges 8:24</a> ff). The Bedouins, notwithstanding their wild nomadic life, retain their ancestral love of finery to the present day. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32-47. the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught&#8212;Some of the captives having been killed (Nu 31:17) and part of the cattle taken for the support of the army, the total amount of the booty remaining was in the following proportions:<p>Prey Total Amount Half to Soldiers Deducted to God Half to Congregation Deducted to Levites Sheep 675,000 337,500 675 337,500 6,750 Beeves 72,000 36,000 72 36,000 720 Asses 61,000 30,500 61 30,500 610 Persons 32,000 16,000 32 16,000 320<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught,.... The remainder of it, besides what they had eaten in their return from the war, and during their seven days' stay without the camp: from hence to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-47.htm">Numbers 31:47</a> is only an account of the prey or booty taken, which in general were 675,000 sheep, 72,000 beeves or oxen, 61,000 asses, and 32,000 females who had never known man; the half out of these, which fell to the share of the soldiers, were 337,500 sheep, 36,000 beeves or oxen, 30,500 asses, and 16,000 females, out of which were given as an heave offering to the Lord six hundred and seventy five sheep, seventy two beeves or oxen, sixty one asses, and thirty two women: the half divided unto the children of Israel consisted of 337,500 sheep, 36,000 beeves or oxen, 30,500 asses, and 16,000 women, out of which one in fifty, both of women and cattle, were given to the Levites; what that amounted to is not expressed, but may be easily reckoned. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">(Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The booty, viz., "the rest of the booty, which the men of war had taken," i.e., all the persons taken prisoners that had not been put to death, and all the cattle taken as booty that had not been consumed during the march home, amounted to 675,000 head of small cattle, 72,000 oxen, 61,000 asses, and 32,000 maidens. Each half, therefore, consisted of 337,500 head of small cattle, 36,000 oxen, 30,500 asses, and 16,000 maidens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-36.htm">Numbers 31:36</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43-46</a>). Of the one half the priests received 675 head of small cattle, 72 oxen, 61 asses, and 32 maidens for Jehovah; and these Moses handed over to Eleazar, in all probability for the maintenance of the priests, in the same manner as the tithes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26-28</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a>), so that they might put the cattle into their own flocks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-3.htm">Numbers 35:3</a>), and slay oxen or sheep as they required them, whilst they sold the asses, and made slaves of the gifts; and not in the character of a vow, in which case the clean animals would have had to be sacrificed, and the unclean animals, as well as the human beings, to be redeemed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-2.htm">Leviticus 27:2-13</a>). Of the other half, the Levites received the fiftieth part (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43-47</a>), that is to say, 6750 head of small cattle, 720 oxen, 610 asses, and 320 girls.
