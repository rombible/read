Thus God would preserve in their minds a dread and detestation of shedding blood. The spoil had been used by Midianites, and being now come into the possession of Israelites, it was fit that it should be purified.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Brass - Render copper.

A process of purification was to be undergone, as the law required (Le 15:13; Nu 19:9-12), and this purifying ceremony was extended to dress, houses, tents, to everything on which a dead body had lain, which had been touched by the blood-stained hands of the Israelitish warriors, or which had been the property of idolaters. This became a standing ordinance in all time coming (Le 6:28; 11:33; 15:12).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day,....

The question in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-15.htm">Numbers 31:15</a>, "Have ye left all the women alive?" is an expression of dissatisfaction, and reproof for their having done this. &#1500;&#1502;&#1505;&#1512;&#1470;&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;...&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;, "they have become to the Israelites to work unfaithfulness towards Jehovah," i.e., they have induced them to commit an act of unfaithfulness towards Jehovah.

On the fact itself, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-6.htm">Numbers 25:6</a>. The object of the command to put all the male children to death, was to exterminate the whole nation, as it could not be perpetuated in the women. Of the female sex, all were to be put to death who had known the lying with a man, and therefore might possibly have been engaged in the licentious worship of Peor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-2.htm">Numbers 25:2</a>), to preserve the congregation from all contamination from that abominable idolatry. </body></html>
