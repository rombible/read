They presented the gold they found among the spoils, as an offering to the Lord. Thus they confessed, that instead of claiming a reward for their service, they needed forgiveness of much that had been amiss, and desired to be thankful for the preservation of their lives, which might justly have been taken away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "chains" were "armlets" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>.

The atonement was not for any special offence committed (which would have called for a sacrifice of blood-shedding), but rather like the half-shekel given at the census in the Book of Exodus (loc. cite), was an acknowledgment of having received undeserved mercies. These, if unacknowledged, would have entailed guilt on the soul. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>48-54. officers &#8230; said &#8230; there lacketh not one man of us&#8212;A victory so signal, and the glory of which was untarnished by the loss of a single Israelitish soldier, was an astonishing miracle. So clearly betokening the direct interposition of Heaven, it might well awaken the liveliest feelings of grateful acknowledgment to God (Ps 44:2, 3). The oblation they brought for the Lord "was partly an atonement" or reparation for their error (Nu 31:14-16), for it could not possess any expiatory virtue, and partly a tribute of gratitude for the stupendous service rendered them. It consisted of the "spoil," which, being the acquisition of individual valor, was not divided like the "prey," or livestock, each soldier retaining it in lieu of pay; it was offered by the "captains" alone, whose pious feelings were evinced by the dedication of the spoil which fell to their share. There were jewels to the amount of 16,750 shekels, equal to &pound;87,869 16s. 5d. sterling.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> For their error, noted, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/31-14.htm" title="And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle....">Numbers 31:14-16</a></span>, and withal <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">for a memorial, </span> as it is said <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-54.htm" title="And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.">Numbers 31:54</a></span>, or by way of gratitude for such a stupendous assistance and deliverance, as appears from the word therefore in the beginning of this verse, and from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-49.htm" title="And they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacks not one man of us.">Numbers 31:49</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>We have therefore brought an oblation to the Lord,....

Of the one half the priests received 675 head of small cattle, 72 oxen, 61 asses, and 32 maidens for Jehovah; and these Moses handed over to Eleazar, in all probability for the maintenance of the priests, in the same manner as the tithes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26-28</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a>), so that they might put the cattle into their own flocks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-3.htm">Numbers 35:3</a>), and slay oxen or sheep as they required them, whilst they sold the asses, and made slaves of the gifts; and not in the character of a vow, in which case the clean animals would have had to be sacrificed, and the unclean animals, as well as the human beings, to be redeemed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-2.htm">Leviticus 27:2-13</a>). Of the other half, the Levites received the fiftieth part (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/31-43.htm">Numbers 31:43-47</a>), that is to say, 6750 head of small cattle, 720 oxen, 610 asses, and 320 girls.
