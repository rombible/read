Shortly after the capture of these Midianitish women, and, it may be, as arising out of it, the law concerning marriage with captives was enacted. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/21-10.htm" title="When you go forth to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God has delivered them into your hands, and you have taken them captive,">Deuteronomy 21:10-14</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/31.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>31:13-18 The sword of war should spare women and children; but the sword of justice should know no distinction, but that of guilty or not guilty. This war was the execution of a righteous sentence upon a guilty nation, in which the women were the worst criminals. The female children were spared, who, being brought up among the Israelites, would not tempt them to idolatry. The whole history shows the hatefulness of sin, and the guilt of tempting others; it teaches us to avoid all occasions of evil, and to give no quarter to inward lusts. The women and children were not kept for sinful purposes, but for slaves, a custom every where practised in former times, as to captives. In the course of providence, when famine and plagues visit a nation for sin, children suffer in the common calamity. In this case parents are punished in their children; and for children dying before actual sin, full provision is made as to their eternal happiness, by the mercy of God in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Caused ... to commit trespass - More literally, "became to the children of Israel for a cause (or, incitement) of treachery to the Lord." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14-18. And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host&#8212;The displeasure of the great leader, though it appears the ebullition of a fierce and sanguinary temper, arose in reality from a pious and enlightened regard to the best interests of Israel. No order had been given for the slaughter of the women, and in ancient war they were commonly reserved for slaves. By their antecedent conduct, however, the Midianitish women had forfeited all claims to mild or merciful treatment; and the sacred character, the avowed object of the war (Nu 31:2, 3), made their slaughter necessary without any special order. But why "kill every male among the little ones"? It was designed to be a war of extermination, such as God Himself had ordered against the people of Canaan, whom the Midianites equalled in the enormity of their wickedness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Not known a man, </span> to wit, <span class="ital">carnally</span>: <span class="bld">See Poole "Ge </span> 4:1 19:8 <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-22.htm" title="You shall not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.">Leviticus 18:22</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Keep alive for yourselves; </span> either to sell them as slaves to others, or to use them as servants to yourselves, or to marry them, when you have prepared and instructed them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But all the women children,....
