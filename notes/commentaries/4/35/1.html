For though the typical service of the tabernacle or temple was only in one place, the preaching of the word of God, and prayer and praise, were not thus confined. These cities were to be given out of each tribe. Each thus made a grateful acknowledgement to God. Each tribe had the benefit of the Levites dwelling amongst them, to teach them the knowledge of the Lord; thus no parts of the country were left to sit in darkness. The gospel provides that he who is taught in the word, should communicate to him that teaches, in all good things, Ga 6:6. We are to free God's ministers from distracting cares, and to leave them at leisure for the duties of their station; so that they may be wholly employed therein, and avail themselves of every opportunity, by acts of kindness, to gain the good-will of the people, and to draw their attention.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Of the representatives now selected through Moses beforehand, who were all princes, i. e. heads of chief families, in their respective tribes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-2.htm">Numbers 13:2</a>), Caleb alone, of the tribe of Judah, is otherwise known to us (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-4.htm">Numbers 13:4</a> ff). The order in which the tribes are named is peculiar to this passage. If they be taken in pairs, Judah and Simeon, Benjamin and Dan, Manasseh and Ephraim, Zebulun and Issachar, Asher and Naphtali, the order of the pairs agrees with the order in which the allotments in the Holy land, taken also in couples, followed each other in the map from south to north. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/35.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 35<p>Nu 35:1-5.

After he had described the borders of the land, and given instructions about the division of it among the several tribes, and named the persons that should be concerned in parting and putting it into the possession of the Israelites, he makes a provision for the Levites; for though they had no inheritance in the land as a tribe, yet it was proper they should have cities and houses to dwell in; for it would not be suitable that they should be always about the tabernacle, as they were in the wilderness; and it is concerning this the Lord is said to speak to Moses: <p>in the plains of Moab by Jordan, near Jericho: where the Israelites now were, and had been for some time: <p>saying; as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/35.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/35.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1–8</span>. <span class="ital">The Levitical cities<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span>The Levites are to receive 48 cities with their surrounding land (E.VV. ‘suburbs’), six of which are to be ‘cities of refuge.’ The cities are to be contributed by each tribe in numbers proportionate to its size. Each plot of land is to be a square of 2,000 cubits (<span class="ital">c.</span> 1,000 yards). The carrying out of this law is related in fuller detail in Joshua 21, where the allotment is as follows: the <span class="ital">Kohathite Levites</span> were given 10 towns in Ephraim, Dan and western Manasseh, the <span class="ital">Gershonites</span> 13 in Issachar, Asher, Naphtali and eastern Manasseh, the <span class="ital">Merarites</span> 12 in Reuben, Gad and Zebulun, while the <span class="ital">priests</span> had 10 in Judah, Simeon and Benjamin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Two considerations, however, shew that this is a purely ideal arrangement, which could never have been actually brought about: 1st, In a hilly country like Palestine, cut with deep ravines, it would be impossible to find 48 square plots of land of such a size. 2nd, It is at variance with statements in earlier passages, (<span class="ital">a</span>) In Deuteronomy the Levites are classed with widows, orphans and strangers, as poor people who are commended to the charity of Israel; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-12.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; for as much as he has no part nor inheritance with you.">Deuteronomy 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm" title="But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put your hands to.">Deuteronomy 12:18</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-27.htm" title="How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me?
