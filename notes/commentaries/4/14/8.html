Caleb and Joshua assured the people of the goodness of the land. They made nothing of the difficulties in the way of their gaining it. If men were convinced of the desirableness of the gains of religion, they would not stick at the services of it. Though the Canaanites dwell in walled cities, their defence was departed from them. The other spies took notice of their strength, but these of their wickedness. No people can be safe, when they have provoked God to leave them. Though Israel dwell in tents, they are fortified. While we have the presence of God with us, we need not fear the most powerful force against us. Sinners are ruined by their own rebellion. But those who, like Caleb and Joshua, faithfully expose themselves for God, are sure to be taken under his special protection, and shall be hid from the rage of men, either under heaven or in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Already Caleb had endeavored to still the people before Moses <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>; already Moses himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-29.htm">Deuteronomy 1:29</a> ff) had endeavored to recall the people to obedience.

This appalling description of Canaan had so depressing an influence upon the whole congregation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a> : they "made their heart melt," i.e., threw them into utter despair), that they raised a loud cry, and wept in the night in consequence. The whole nation murmured against Moses and Aaron their two leaders, saying "Would that we had died in Egypt or in this wilderness! Why will Jehovah bring us into this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should become a prey (be made slaves by the enemy; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-27.htm">Deuteronomy 1:27-28</a>)?
