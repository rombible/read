Herein he was a type of Christ, who prayed for those that despitefully used him. The pardon of a nation's sin, is the turning away the nation's punishment; and for that Moses is here so earnest. Moses argued that, consistently with God's character, in his abundant mercies, he could forgive them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their defense - literally, "their shadow," i. e. their shelter as from the scorching sun: an Oriental figure.

Out of the cloud upon the tabernacle: <p>how long will this people provoke me? which suggests that they had often provoked him, and had done it long ago, and still continued to do so; and he had long bore their provocations; but it was not reasonable, nor could it be expected by Moses or any other, that he would bear them much longer: <p>and how long will it be ere they believe me; unbelief was a sin they had often and long been guilty of, and which greatly prevailed among them, and was the root of all their murmurings, mutiny, and rebellion; and what was highly provoking to the Lord, since they ought to have believed him, and that he was able to make good, and would make good his promises to them: <p>for all the signs which I have showed among them; the wonders and miracles he had wrought in Egypt, at the Red sea, and in the wilderness, and in their sight; on account of which they should have given credit to his word, and which were strong aggravations of their unbelief; and is the true reason why they entered not into the good land, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-18.htm">Hebrews 3:18</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have showed among them?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11â€“24</span>.

"In such distress, nothing remained but to pour out their desires before God; offering their prayer in public, however, and in the sight of all the people, in the hope of turning their minds" (Calvin). Joshua and Caleb, who had gone with the others to explore the land, also rent their clothes, as a sign of their deep distress at the rebellious attitude of the people (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>), and tried to convince them of the goodness and glory of the land they had travelled through, and to incite them to trust in the Lord. "If Jehovah take pleasure in us,"; they said, "He will bring us into this land. Only rebel not ye against Jehovah, neither fear ye that people of the land; for they are our food;" i.e., we can and shall swallow them up, or easily destroy them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm">Numbers 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>). "Their shadow is departed from them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not!" "Their shadow" is the shelter and protection of God (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>). The shadow, which defends from the burning heat of the sun, was a very natural figure in the sultry East, to describe defence from injury, a refuge from danger and destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>). The protection of God had departed from the Canaanites, because God had determined to destroy them when the measure of their iniquity was full (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-24.htm">Exodus 34:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-25.htm">Leviticus 18:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-23.htm">Leviticus 20:23</a>). But the excited people resolved to stone them, when Jehovah interposed with His judgment, and His glory appeared in the tabernacle to all the Israelites; that is to say, the majesty of God flashed out before the eyes of the people in a light which suddenly burst forth from the tabernacle (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-10.htm">Exodus 16:10</a>). </body></html>
