But disbelief of the promise forbids the benefit. Those who despise the pleasant land shall be shut out of it. The promise of God should be fulfilled to their children. They wished to die in the wilderness; God made their sin their ruin, took them at their word, and their carcases fell in the wilderness. They were made to groan under the burden of their own sin, which was too heavy for them to bear. Ye shall know my breach of promise, both the causes of it, that it is procured by your sin, for God never leaves any till they first leave him; and the consequences of it, that will produce your ruin. But your little ones, now under twenty years old, which ye, in your unbelief, said should be a prey, them will I bring in. God will let them know that he can put a difference between the guilty and the innocent, and cut them off without touching their children. Thus God would not utterly take away his loving kindness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render: And now the Amalekites and the Canaanites are dwelling (or abiding) in the valley: wherefore turn you, etc. (that so ye be not smitten before them).

"The Amalekites," etc.: this clause furnishes the reason for the command which follows. On the Amalekites, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-12.htm">Genesis 36:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8</a>.

"The valley" is no doubt the broad Wady Murreh (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>), including a portion of the Negeb, in which the Amalekites led a nomad life, whilst the Canaanites really dwelt upon the mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>), close up to the Wady Murreh. </body></html>
