But disbelief of the promise forbids the benefit. Those who despise the pleasant land shall be shut out of it. The promise of God should be fulfilled to their children. They wished to die in the wilderness; God made their sin their ruin, took them at their word, and their carcases fell in the wilderness. They were made to groan under the burden of their own sin, which was too heavy for them to bear. Ye shall know my breach of promise, both the causes of it, that it is procured by your sin, for God never leaves any till they first leave him; and the consequences of it, that will produce your ruin. But your little ones, now under twenty years old, which ye, in your unbelief, said should be a prey, them will I bring in. God will let them know that he can put a difference between the guilty and the innocent, and cut them off without touching their children. Thus God would not utterly take away his loving kindness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render: And now the Amalekites and the Canaanites are dwelling (or abiding) in the valley: wherefore turn you, etc. (that so ye be not smitten before them). The Amalekites were the nomad bands that roved through the open pastures of the plain <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a> : the Canaanites, a term here taken in its wider sense, were the Amorites of the neighboring cities (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>), who probably lived in league with the Amalekites.<p>Tomorrow - Not necessarily the next day, but an idiom for "hereafter," "henceforward" (compare the marginal reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-14.htm">Exodus 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6</a>).<p>By the way of the Red sea - That is, apparently, by the eastern or Elanitic gulf. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley)&#8212;that is, on the other side of the Idumean mountain, at whose base they were then encamped. Those nomad tribes had at that time occupied it with a determination to oppose the further progress of the Hebrew people. Hence God gave the command that they seek a safe and timely retreat into the desert, to escape the pursuit of those resolute enemies, to whom, with their wives and children, they would fall a helpless prey because they had forfeited the presence and protection of God. This verse forms an important part of the narrative and should be freed from the parenthetical form which our English translators have given it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron,....

All the people above twenty years old, except Joshua and Caleb, were condemned to wander for forty years and die in the desert. The spies who brought an evil report died by a plague. The greater part of this section has been assigned to P , but elements from early tradition have been incorporated in it. The ‘forty years’ is alluded to as early as Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-10.htm" title="On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their armies: and the captain of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.">Numbers 2:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-25.htm" title="Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it on the altar:">Numbers 5:25</a>), and the wandering in the wilderness in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-14.htm" title="Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.">Hosea 2:14</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron.</span> This communication is clearly by way of continuation and amplification of the sentence briefly pronounced above.

The two are blended together in the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1.htm">Deuteronomy 1</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In answer to this importunate prayer, the Lord promised forgiveness, namely, the preservation of the nation, but not the remission of the well-merited punishment. At the rebellion at Sinai, He had postponed the punishment "till the day of His visitation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm">Exodus 32:34</a>). And that day had now arrived, as the people had carried their continued rebellion against the Lord to the furthest extreme, even to an open declaration of their intention to depose Moses, and return to Egypt under another leader, and thus had filled up the measure of their sins. "Nevertheless," added the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a>), "as truly as I live, and the glory of Jehovah will fill the whole earth, all the men who have seen My glory and My miracles...shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers." The clause, "all the earth," etc., forms an apposition to "as I live." Jehovah proves Himself to be living, by the fact that His glory fills the whole earth. But this was to take place, not, as Knobel, who mistakes the true connection of the different clauses, erroneously supposes, by the destruction of the whole of that generation, which would be talked of by all the world, but rather by the fact that, notwithstanding the sin and opposition of these men, He would still carry out His work of salvation to a glorious victory. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a> introduces the substance of the oath, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a>; and according to the ordinary form of an oath, &#1488;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-23.htm">Numbers 14:23</a> signifies "not." - "They have tempted Me now ten times." Ten is used as the number of completeness and full measure; and this answered to the actual fact, if we follow the Rabbins, and add to the murmuring (1) at the Red Sea, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11-12</a>; (2) at Marah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23</a>; (3) in the wilderness of Sin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2</a>; (4) at Rephidim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1</a>; (5) at Horeb, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>; (6) at Tabeerah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a>; (7) at the graves of lust, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a>.; and (8) here again at Kadesh, the twofold rebellion of certain individuals against the commandments of God at the giving of the manna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-20.htm">Exodus 16:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-27.htm">Exodus 16:27</a>). The despisers of God should none of them see the promised land. </body></html>
