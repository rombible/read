We cannot, however, regard this offer as embodying a deliberate intention, for we know that God did not really mean to cast off Israel; nor can we regard it as expressing the anger of the moment, for it is not of God to be hasty. We must understand it distinctly as intended to try the loyalty and charity of Moses, and to give him an opportunity of rising to the loftiest height of magnanimity, unselfishness, and courage. Moses would unquestionably have been less noble than he was if he had listened to the offer; it is therefore certain that the offer was only made in order that it might be refused (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At this murmuring, which was growing into open rebellion, Moses and Aaron fell upon their faces before the whole of the assembled congregation, namely, to pour out their distress before the Lord, and move Him to interpose; that is to say, after they had made an unsuccessful attempt, as we may supply from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-29.htm">Deuteronomy 1:29-31</a>, to cheer up the people, by pointing them to the help they had thus far received from God. "In such distress, nothing remained but to pour out their desires before God; offering their prayer in public, however, and in the sight of all the people, in the hope of turning their minds" (Calvin). Joshua and Caleb, who had gone with the others to explore the land, also rent their clothes, as a sign of their deep distress at the rebellious attitude of the people (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>), and tried to convince them of the goodness and glory of the land they had travelled through, and to incite them to trust in the Lord. "If Jehovah take pleasure in us,"; they said, "He will bring us into this land. Only rebel not ye against Jehovah, neither fear ye that people of the land; for they are our food;" i.e., we can and shall swallow them up, or easily destroy them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-4.htm">Numbers 22:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm">Numbers 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-4.htm">Psalm 14:4</a>). "Their shadow is departed from them, and Jehovah is with us: fear them not!" "Their shadow" is the shelter and protection of God (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>). The shadow, which defends from the burning heat of the sun, was a very natural figure in the sultry East, to describe defence from injury, a refuge from danger and destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>). The protection of God had departed from the Canaanites, because God had determined to destroy them when the measure of their iniquity was full (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-24.htm">Exodus 34:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-25.htm">Leviticus 18:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-23.htm">Leviticus 20:23</a>). But the excited people resolved to stone them, when Jehovah interposed with His judgment, and His glory appeared in the tabernacle to all the Israelites; that is to say, the majesty of God flashed out before the eyes of the people in a light which suddenly burst forth from the tabernacle (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-10.htm">Exodus 16:10</a>). </body></html>
