The reference appears to be to the original covenant made with Abraham, and renewed to Isaac and Jacob, respecting the possession of the land of Canaan.

But disbelief of the promise forbids the benefit. Those who despise the pleasant land shall be shut out of it. The promise of God should be fulfilled to their children. They wished to die in the wilderness; God made their sin their ruin, took them at their word, and their carcases fell in the wilderness. They were made to groan under the burden of their own sin, which was too heavy for them to bear. Ye shall know my breach of promise, both the causes of it, that it is procured by your sin, for God never leaves any till they first leave him; and the consequences of it, that will produce your ruin. But your little ones, now under twenty years old, which ye, in your unbelief, said should be a prey, them will I bring in. God will let them know that he can put a difference between the guilty and the innocent, and cut them off without touching their children.

Caleb is mentioned first, as Aben Ezra thinks, because he first appeased and quieted the people; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-38.htm">Numbers 14:38</a> Joshua stands first, so that nothing is to be inferred from hence; these were the only two of the spies that went into the land of Canaan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-4.htm">Numbers 13:4</a>; and the only two of the Israelites that were numbered, from twenty years old and upwards, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29</a>; those of the tribe of Levi, not being in that account, must be remembered to be excepted also. <p>(a)   "si vos ingressi fueritis", Pagninus, Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sware.</span> Literally, "lifted up my hand" (see on Genesis 14:22). <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua the son of Nun.</span> The exception in favour of his "minister," Joshua, had been taken for granted in the brief answer of God to Moses; in the fuller announcement of his purposes to the congregation it was natural that he too should be mentioned by name. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But because there was another spirit in Caleb, - i.e., not the unbelieving, despairing, yet proud and rebellious spirit of the great mass of the people, but the spirit of obedience and believing trust, so that "he followed Jehovah fully" (lit., "fulfilled to walk behind Jehovah"), followed Him with unwavering fidelity, - God would bring him into the land into which he had gone, and his seed should possess it.

According to the context, the reference is not to Hebron particularly, but to Canaan generally, which God had sworn unto the fathers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-23.htm">Numbers 14:23</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-36.htm">Deuteronomy 1:36</a>, comp. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35</a>); although, when the land was divided, Caleb received Hebron for his possession, because, according to his own statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>., Moses had sworn that he would give it to him. But this is not mentioned here; just as Joshua also is not mentioned in this place, as he is at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-30.htm">Numbers 14:30</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-38.htm">Numbers 14:38</a>, but Caleb only, who opposed the exaggerated accounts of the other spies at the very first, and endeavoured to quiet the excitement of the people by declaring that they were well able to overcome the Canaanites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>). This first revelation of God to Moses is restricted to the main fact; the particulars are given afterwards in the sentence of God, as intended for communication to the people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26-38</a>). </body></html>
