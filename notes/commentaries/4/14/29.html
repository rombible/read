But disbelief of the promise forbids the benefit. Those who despise the pleasant land shall be shut out of it. The promise of God should be fulfilled to their children. They wished to die in the wilderness; God made their sin their ruin, took them at their word, and their carcases fell in the wilderness. They were made to groan under the burden of their own sin, which was too heavy for them to bear. Ye shall know my breach of promise, both the causes of it, that it is procured by your sin, for God never leaves any till they first leave him; and the consequences of it, that will produce your ruin. But your little ones, now under twenty years old, which ye, in your unbelief, said should be a prey, them will I bring in. God will let them know that he can put a difference between the guilty and the innocent, and cut them off without touching their children. Thus God would not utterly take away his loving kindness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render: And now the Amalekites and the Canaanites are dwelling (or abiding) in the valley: wherefore turn you, etc. (that so ye be not smitten before them). The Amalekites were the nomad bands that roved through the open pastures of the plain <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a> : the Canaanites, a term here taken in its wider sense, were the Amorites of the neighboring cities (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>), who probably lived in league with the Amalekites.<p>Tomorrow - Not necessarily the next day, but an idiom for "hereafter," "henceforward" (compare the marginal reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-14.htm">Exodus 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-6.htm">Joshua 4:6</a>).<p>By the way of the Red sea - That is, apparently, by the eastern or Elanitic gulf. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley)&#8212;that is, on the other side of the Idumean mountain, at whose base they were then encamped. Those nomad tribes had at that time occupied it with a determination to oppose the further progress of the Hebrew people. Hence God gave the command that they seek a safe and timely retreat into the desert, to escape the pursuit of those resolute enemies, to whom, with their wives and children, they would fall a helpless prey because they had forfeited the presence and protection of God. This verse forms an important part of the narrative and should be freed from the parenthetical form which our English translators have given it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness,....

The Levites, however, were not included in that census (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-47.htm" title="But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them.">Numbers 1:47</a>), and the priestly writer probably assumed that the sentence of death in the wilderness did not apply to them. Aaron’s son Eleazar succeeded his father as high priest on the borders of Canaan, and he must certainly have been over 20 years of age at this time, since he acted in a responsible position as priest before the departure from Sinai (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-3.htm" title="These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office.">Numbers 3:3</a> f., 32, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-16.htm" title="And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertains the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.">Numbers 4:16</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that were numbered of you...  from twenty years old</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-18.htm">Numbers 1:18, 19, 47</a>).

At the rebellion at Sinai, He had postponed the punishment "till the day of His visitation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-34.htm">Exodus 32:34</a>). And that day had now arrived, as the people had carried their continued rebellion against the Lord to the furthest extreme, even to an open declaration of their intention to depose Moses, and return to Egypt under another leader, and thus had filled up the measure of their sins. "Nevertheless," added the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a>), "as truly as I live, and the glory of Jehovah will fill the whole earth, all the men who have seen My glory and My miracles...shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers." The clause, "all the earth," etc., forms an apposition to "as I live." Jehovah proves Himself to be living, by the fact that His glory fills the whole earth. But this was to take place, not, as Knobel, who mistakes the true connection of the different clauses, erroneously supposes, by the destruction of the whole of that generation, which would be talked of by all the world, but rather by the fact that, notwithstanding the sin and opposition of these men, He would still carry out His work of salvation to a glorious victory. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a> introduces the substance of the oath, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a>; and according to the ordinary form of an oath, &#1488;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-23.htm">Numbers 14:23</a> signifies "not." - "They have tempted Me now ten times." Ten is used as the number of completeness and full measure; and this answered to the actual fact, if we follow the Rabbins, and add to the murmuring (1) at the Red Sea, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11-12</a>; (2) at Marah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23</a>; (3) in the wilderness of Sin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2</a>; (4) at Rephidim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1</a>; (5) at Horeb, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>; (6) at Tabeerah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a>; (7) at the graves of lust, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a>.; and (8) here again at Kadesh, the twofold rebellion of certain individuals against the commandments of God at the giving of the manna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-20.htm">Exodus 16:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-27.htm">Exodus 16:27</a>). The despisers of God should none of them see the promised land. </body></html>
