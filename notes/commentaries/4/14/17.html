Herein he was a type of Christ, who prayed for those that despitefully used him. The pardon of a nation's sin, is the turning away the nation's punishment; and for that Moses is here so earnest. Moses argued that, consistently with God's character, in his abundant mercies, he could forgive them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The syntax of these verses is singularly broken. As did Paul when deeply moved, so Moses presses his arguments one on the other without pausing to ascertain the grammatical finish of his expressions. He speaks here as if in momentary apprehension of an outbreak of God's wrath, unless he could perhaps arrest it by crowding in every topic of deprecation and intercession that he could mention on the instant. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. let the power of my Lord be great&#8212;be magnified.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Be great, </span> i.e. appear to be great, discover its greatness; a real verb put for a declarative, or the thing for the manifestation of the thing.

Nor is it strange that the pardon of sin, especially of such great sins, be spoken of as an act of power in God, because undoubtedly it is an act of omnipotent and infinite goodness; whence despairing sinners sometimes cry out that their sins are greater than God can pardon, as some translate Cain’s words, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-13.htm" title="And Cain said to the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.">Genesis 4:13</a></span>.

That is, appear to be great; the power of God is great, not only mighty, but almighty; it knows no bounds, nothing is impossible with him, he can do whatever he pleases, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-5.htm">Psalm 147:5</a>; his power, and the greatness of it, had been seen in bringing the children of Israel out of Egypt, and through the Red sea, and in providing for them, protecting and defending them in the wilderness; and the request of Moses is, that it might appear greater and greater in bringing them into the land of promise; or else he means an exceeding great display of the grace and mercy of God in the forgiveness of the sins of the people; for as the power of God is seen in his forbearance and longsuffering with the wicked, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-22.htm">Romans 9:22</a>; much more in the forgiveness of the sins of men, there being more power and virtue in grace to pardon, than there is in sin to damn; and as it is an indication of strength in men, and of their power over themselves, when they can rule their own spirits, keep under their passions, and restrain their wrath, and show a forgiving temper, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-32.htm">Proverbs 16:32</a>; so it is an instance of the power of God to overcome his wrath and anger stirred up by the sins of men; and, notwithstanding their provocations, freely to forgive: pardon of sin is an act of power, as well as of grace and mercy, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-6.htm">Matthew 9:6</a>; and this sense agrees with what follows. The first letter in the word for "great" is larger than usual, that it might be taken notice of; and to signify the exceeding greatness of the power of God, Moses desired might be displayed in this case: and the letter numerically signifies ten, and has been thought to respect the ten times that Israel tempted the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22</a>; and to suggest, that though they had so done, yet the grace and mercy of God should ten times exceed the ingratitude of the people (u): <p>according as thou hast spoken, saying; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>; and is as follows. <p>(u) Baal Hatturim in loc. &amp; Buxtorf.

Jehovah resented the conduct of the people as base contempt of His deity, and as utter mistrust of Him, notwithstanding all the signs which He had wrought in the midst of the nation; and declared that He would smite the rebellious people with pestilence, and destroy them, and make of Moses a greater and still mightier people. This was just what He had done before, when the rebellion took place at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>). But Moses, as a servant who was faithful over the whole house of God, and therefore sought not his own honour, but the honour of his God alone, stood in the breach on this occasion also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-23.htm">Psalm 106:23</a>), with a similar intercessory prayer to that which he had presented at Horeb, except that on this occasion he pleaded the honour of God among the heathen, and the glorious revelation of the divine nature with which he had been favoured at Sinai, as a motive for sparing the rebellious nation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13-19</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). The first he expressed in these words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>.): "Not only have the Egyptians heard that Thou hast brought out this people from among them with Thy might; they have also told it to the inhabitants of this land. They (the Egyptians and the other nations) have heard that Thou, Jehovah, art in the midst of this people; that Thou, Jehovah, appearest eye to eye, and Thy cloud stands over them, and Thou goest before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. Now, if Thou shouldst slay this people as one man, the nations which have heard the tidings of Thee would say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which He sware to them, He has slain them in the desert." In that case God would be regarded by the heathen as powerless, and His honour would be impaired (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-9.htm">Joshua 7:9</a>). It was for the sake of His own honour that God, at a later time, did not allow the Israelites to perish in exile (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>). - &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;...&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm">Numbers 14:14</a>), et audierunt et dixerunt; &#1493; - &#1493;  equals  et - et, both - and. The inhabitants of this land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>) were not merely the Arabians, but, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>., the tribes dwelling in and round Arabia, the Philistines, Edomites, Moabites, and Canaanites, to whom the tidings had been brought of the miracles of God in Egypt and at the Dead Sea. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm">Numbers 14:14</a>, can neither stand for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (dixerunt) se audivisse, nor for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, qui audierunt. They are neither of them grammatically admissible, as the relative pronoun cannot be readily omitted in prose; and neither of them would give a really suitable meaning. It is rather a rhetorical resumption of the &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>, and the subject of the verb is not only "the Egyptians," but also "the inhabitants of this land" who held communication with the Egyptians, or "the nations" who had heard the report of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-15.htm">Numbers 14:15</a>), i.e., all that God had hitherto done for and among the Israelites in Egypt, and on the journey through the desert. "Eye to eye:" i.e., Thou hast appeared to them in the closest proximity. On the pillar of cloud and fire, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>. "As one man," equivalent to "with a stroke" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-16.htm">Judges 6:16</a>). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-17.htm">Numbers 14:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>, Moses adduces a second argument, viz., the word in which God Himself had revealed His inmost being to him at Sinai (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). The words, "Let the power be great," equivalent to "show Thyself great in power," are not to be connected with what precedes, but with what follows; viz., "show Thyself mighty by verifying Thy word, 'Jehovah, long-suffering and great in mercy,' etc.; forgive, I beseech Thee, this people according to the greatness of Thy mercy, and as Thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now." &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-19.htm">Numbers 14:19</a>)  equals  &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>). </body></html>
