They may be attached to the words which precede: “And his seed shall possess it, and the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelling in the valley”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>shall possess the land occupied by them. There are strong objections, however, to this rendering, as well as to the rendering adopted by the Authorised Version, if the latter be understood as an historical statement respecting the geographical position of the Amalekites and Canaanites, of which Moses can scarcely be supposed to have been ignorant, and which may be assigned with greater probability to the “hill” than to the “valley.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm" title="Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelled in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.">Numbers 14:45</a> and Note; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm" title="And the Amorites, which dwelled in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even to Hormah.">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>, where one or both of these races are spoken of under the name of <span class= "ital">Amorites </span>or <span class= "ital">mountaineers.</span>) The word which is rendered “dwelt” is often used in reference to a temporary sojourn, as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-9.htm" title="Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.">Joshua 8:9</a> of the ambuscade sent by Joshua, which “abode” between Bethel and Ai, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-13.htm" title="And David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred stayed by the stuff.">1Samuel 25:13</a> of a portion of David’s men who “abode by the stuff.” It is used also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm" title="Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelled in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.">Numbers 14:45</a> of this chapter in respect to the position of the Amalekites and Canaanites, whether temporary or permanent, in the “hill,” which appears to be used in contrast with the “valley.” The passage may be rendered thus: “Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites are abiding in the valley,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>are lying in ambuscade in the valley, and waiting for an opportunity to attack the Israelites (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-43.htm" title="For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword: because you are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.">Numbers 14:43</a>). If this interpretation of the words, which is that of Ibn Ezra, be adopted, they afford a strong reason for the command which follows:—“To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea”—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>do not fall into the snare which is laid for you, but turn and go in a contrary direction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm" title="(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelled in the valley.)

But disbelief of the promise forbids the benefit. Those who despise the pleasant land shall be shut out of it. The promise of God should be fulfilled to their children. They wished to die in the wilderness; God made their sin their ruin, took them at their word, and their carcases fell in the wilderness. They were made to groan under the burden of their own sin, which was too heavy for them to bear. Ye shall know my breach of promise, both the causes of it, that it is procured by your sin, for God never leaves any till they first leave him; and the consequences of it, that will produce your ruin. But your little ones, now under twenty years old, which ye, in your unbelief, said should be a prey, them will I bring in. God will let them know that he can put a difference between the guilty and the innocent, and cut them off without touching their children.

(Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley)&#8212;that is, on the other side of the Idumean mountain, at whose base they were then encamped. Those nomad tribes had at that time occupied it with a determination to oppose the further progress of the Hebrew people. Hence God gave the command that they seek a safe and timely retreat into the desert, to escape the pursuit of those resolute enemies, to whom, with their wives and children, they would fall a helpless prey because they had forfeited the presence and protection of God.

On the other hand ‘the valley’ is not necessarily at variance with ‘mountain’ (or rather ‘hill country’) in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm" title="Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelled in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah.">Numbers 14:45</a></span>, since it denotes not a broad valley or plain but ‘a deep place’ (<span class="greekheb">צֵמֶק</span>), a defile or declivity among the mountains.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">turn ye</span>] They were to retrace their steps, moving S.E. towards the eastern arm of the Red Sea.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.</span> This parenthesis bears on the face of it several difficulties, both as to the meaning of the statement and as to its position in the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It has been stated just before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>) that the "Canaanites" dwelt by the sea, and in the Ghor, and it has been proposed by some to understand under this name the Phoenicians, because "Sidon" was the first-born of Canaan, and because they are known to have occupied the coast. But if "Canaanite" means "Phoenician" in chapter Numbers 13:29, it is difficult to maintain that it is here equivalent to "Amorite." Again, if "Canaanite" be taken in this vaguer sense, yet it is clear that the Amorites dwelt in "the mountain" (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, verse 45 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>), and not in the lowlands. This has been got over by supposing that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> may mean an upland vale, or plateau, such as that to which the Israelites presently ascended. It is, however, a straining of the word to assign such a meaning to it. It is rightly translated by the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;</span>. And even if one looking down from above might call an upland plain by this name, yet certainly one looking up from below would not. If the word stands rightly in this place, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span> must mean "in the Wady Murreh," the broad sandy strait which bounded the "mountain of the Amorite" on the south. If so, we must conclude that not only the roving Amalekites, but also the Canaanites, or Amorites, had established themselves in some parts of the Wady. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It is scarcely credible that an observation of this sort, which would seem unusual and abrupt in any speech, should have formed a part of God's message to Moses. It has no apparent connection with the context. It does not (as often alleged) afford a reason for the command which follows; it was not at all because enemies were already in possession before them that the Israelites had to turn their backs upon the promised land, but because God had withdrawn for the time his promised aid. If the "valley" be the Rakhmah plateau, they had always known that hostile tribes held it, and that they would have to conquer them. That the words are an interpolation, as the A.V. represents them, seems as certain as internal evidence can make it; lint by whom made, and with what intent, is a question which will probably never be answered. It may be worth while to hazard a conjecture that the interpolated words are really connected with what goes before, viz., the promise of inheritance to Caleb. Now that promise was fulfilled in the gift of Hebron to Caleb and his seed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-14.htm">Joshua 14:14</a>). But we have express mention in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-14.htm">Genesis 37:14</a> of the "vale of Hebron," and the same word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>, is used in the Hebrew. Is it not possible that this parenthesis was originally the gloss of one who had a special interest in the heritage of Caleb, and wished to note that at the time it was given to him "the vale" was occupied by two hostile peoples? Into <span class="cmt_word">the wilderness,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Sinaitic peninsula, as distinguished from Palestine on the one hand, and from Egypt on the other. <span class="cmt_word">By the way of the Red Sea,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, towards the Red Sea; here apparently the Elanitic Gulf (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-31.htm">Numbers 11:31</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Intercession of Moses. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-12.htm">Numbers 14:12</a>. Jehovah resented the conduct of the people as base contempt of His deity, and as utter mistrust of Him, notwithstanding all the signs which He had wrought in the midst of the nation; and declared that He would smite the rebellious people with pestilence, and destroy them, and make of Moses a greater and still mightier people. This was just what He had done before, when the rebellion took place at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>). But Moses, as a servant who was faithful over the whole house of God, and therefore sought not his own honour, but the honour of his God alone, stood in the breach on this occasion also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-23.htm">Psalm 106:23</a>), with a similar intercessory prayer to that which he had presented at Horeb, except that on this occasion he pleaded the honour of God among the heathen, and the glorious revelation of the divine nature with which he had been favoured at Sinai, as a motive for sparing the rebellious nation (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13-19</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). The first he expressed in these words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>.): "Not only have the Egyptians heard that Thou hast brought out this people from among them with Thy might; they have also told it to the inhabitants of this land. They (the Egyptians and the other nations) have heard that Thou, Jehovah, art in the midst of this people; that Thou, Jehovah, appearest eye to eye, and Thy cloud stands over them, and Thou goest before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. Now, if Thou shouldst slay this people as one man, the nations which have heard the tidings of Thee would say, Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which He sware to them, He has slain them in the desert." In that case God would be regarded by the heathen as powerless, and His honour would be impaired (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-9.htm">Joshua 7:9</a>). It was for the sake of His own honour that God, at a later time, did not allow the Israelites to perish in exile (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-9.htm">Isaiah 48:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-11.htm">Isaiah 48:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-5.htm">Isaiah 52:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>). - &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;...&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm">Numbers 14:14</a>), et audierunt et dixerunt; &#1493; - &#1493;  equals  et - et, both - and. The inhabitants of this land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>) were not merely the Arabians, but, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14</a>., the tribes dwelling in and round Arabia, the Philistines, Edomites, Moabites, and Canaanites, to whom the tidings had been brought of the miracles of God in Egypt and at the Dead Sea. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-14.htm">Numbers 14:14</a>, can neither stand for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (dixerunt) se audivisse, nor for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, qui audierunt. They are neither of them grammatically admissible, as the relative pronoun cannot be readily omitted in prose; and neither of them would give a really suitable meaning.

"Eye to eye:" i.e., Thou hast appeared to them in the closest proximity. On the pillar of cloud and fire, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>.

The words, "Let the power be great," equivalent to "show Thyself great in power," are not to be connected with what precedes, but with what follows; viz., "show Thyself mighty by verifying Thy word, 'Jehovah, long-suffering and great in mercy,' etc.; forgive, I beseech Thee, this people according to the greatness of Thy mercy, and as Thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now." &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-19.htm">Numbers 14:19</a>)  equals  &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>). </body></html>
