Stoning appears to have been a mode of death commonly adopted in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-26.htm" title="And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: see, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?">Exodus 8:26</a>). Under the Jewish law stoning was the ordinary, and, as some think, the only prescribed mode of death, and was inflicted as the punishment for crimes such as adultery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm" title="If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shall you put away evil from Israel.">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-24.htm" title="Then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife: so you shall put away evil from among you.">Deuteronomy 22:24</a>), idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-10.htm" title="And you shall stone him with stones, that he die; because he has sought to thrust you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.">Deuteronomy 13:10</a>), witchcraft (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-27.htm" title="A man also or woman that has a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be on them.">Leviticus 20:27</a>), sabbath-breaking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-35.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.">Numbers 15:35</a>), and blasphemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-16.htm" title="And he that blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemes the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.">Leviticus 24:16</a>). Moses had apprehended the same outbreak of popular violence on a former occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-4.htm" title="And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they be almost ready to stone me.">Exodus 17:4</a>), and, at a later period, David was threatened in a similar manner (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-6.htm" title="And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.">1Samuel 30:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation.</span>—The meaning probably is in the court of the Tabernacle, or, as some think, above the Tabernacle. (See the Targum of Jonathan and the Vulgate and Septuagint Versions.)

Caleb and Joshua assured the people of the goodness of the land. They made nothing of the difficulties in the way of their gaining it. If men were convinced of the desirableness of the gains of religion, they would not stick at the services of it. Though the Canaanites dwell in walled cities, their defence was departed from them. The other spies took notice of their strength, but these of their wickedness. No people can be safe, when they have provoked God to leave them. Though Israel dwell in tents, they are fortified. While we have the presence of God with us, we need not fear the most powerful force against us. Sinners are ruined by their own rebellion. But those who, like Caleb and Joshua, faithfully expose themselves for God, are sure to be taken under his special protection, and shall be hid from the rage of men, either under heaven or in heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their defense - literally, "their shadow," i. e. their shelter as from the scorching sun: an Oriental figure.

Namely, Joshua and Caleb, who had made such a faithful report of the good land, and had delivered such an animating and encouraging speech to the people. This is not to be understood of the body of the people, and of all the individuals thereof, for who then should they bid to stone Joshua and Caleb? unless the sense is, that they stirred up and animated one another to it; but rather it means the princes and heads of the congregation, who commanded the common people to rise up and stone them; for notwithstanding the affecting behaviour of Moses and Aaron, and the arguments of Joshua and Caleb, they still persisted in their mutiny and rebellion, until the Lord himself appeared as he did: <p>and the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation, before all the children of Israel; the Shechinah, or divine Majesty, which dwelt between the cherubim in the most holy place, came into the court of the tabernacle; for neither in the holy nor in the most holy place could the people see it, or the token of it: in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-15.htm">Deuteronomy 31:15</a> it is said, "the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle"; and Noldius (s) renders it here, "and the glory of the Lord appeared above the tabernacle of the congregation"; with which agree the Targum of Jonathan and the Vulgate Latin and Septuagint versions; and so Jarchi says, the cloud descended there, and from thence very probably some coruscations, or flashes of lightning came forth, which plainly showed the Lord was there; and this was done to terrify the people, and restrain them from their evil, purposes; and to encourage the servants of the Lord, who hereby might expect the divine protection. <p>(s) Concord.

The whole nation murmured against Moses and Aaron their two leaders, saying "Would that we had died in Egypt or in this wilderness! Why will Jehovah bring us into this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should become a prey (be made slaves by the enemy; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-27.htm">Deuteronomy 1:27-28</a>)?
