Even true and great believers sometimes find it hard to trust God under the discouragements of second causes, and against hope to believe in hope.

Seventy is accordingly the number of colleagues assigned to Moses to share his burden with him. To it, the Jews trace the origin of the Sanhedrim.

We find no traces of it in the days of the Judges and the Kings.<p>Elders of the people, and officers over them - In English idiom, "elders and officers of the people." Both elders and officers appear in Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a> ff): the former had headed the nation in its efforts after freedom; the latter were the subordinate, though unwilling, agents of Egyptian tyranny. The two classes no doubt were working together; and from those who belonged to either, perhaps from those who were both eiders and officers, the council of Seventy was to be selected.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17. the Lord said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders&#8212;(Ex 3:16; 5:6; 24:9; 18:21, 24; Le 4:15). An order of seventy was to be created, either by a selection from the existing staff of elders or by the appointment of new ones, empowered to assist him by their collective wisdom and experience in the onerous cares of government. The Jewish writers say that this was the origin of the Sanhedrin, or supreme appellate court of their nation.

Moses was endued with such a large share of it that some could be taken from him and put upon others. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-9.htm" title="And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you.

It seems to have been added by a later writer who thought that the inspiration of the elders was the answer to Moses’ complaint of the burden of the people. See above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(I) <span class="bld">18–24a</span>. The Quails. The continuation of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-13.htm" title="From where should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.">Numbers 11:13</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto Moses.</span> The Divine dignity and goodness of this answer, if not an absolutely conclusive testimony, are at least a very strong one, to the genuineness of this record. Of what god, except the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, was it ever witnessed, or could it have been ever imagined, that he should answer the passionate injustice of his servant with such forbearance and kindness? The one thing in Moses' prayer which was reasonable he allowed at once; the rest he passed over without answer or reproof, as though it had never been uttered. <span class="cmt_word">Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel.</span> That the number seventy has a symbolic significance in Scripture will hardly be denied (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-5.htm">Exodus 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>), although it is probably futile to affix any precise meaning to it. Perhaps the leading idea of seventy is fullness, as that of twelve is symmetry (see on Exodus 15:27). The later Jews believed that there were seventy nations in the world. There is no reason, except a reckless desire to confound the sacred narrative, to identify this appointment with that narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>, <span class="accented">sq.</span> The circumstances and the purposes appear quite distinct: those were appointed to assist Moses in purely secular matters, to share his burden as a judge; these to assist him in religious matters, to support him as a mediator; those used the ordinary gifts of wisdom, discretion, and personal authority; these the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit. It is more reasonable to suppose that these seventy were the same men that went up into Mount Sinai with Moses, and saw the God of Israel, and ate of the consecrated meal of the covenant, about a year before. Unless there was some decisive reason against it, an elder who had been chosen for that high religious privilege could hardly fail to be chosen on this occasion also; an interview with God himself, so mysteriously and awfully significant, must surely have left an ineffaceable stamp of sanctity on any soul at all worthy of it. It would be natural to suppose that while the present selection was made <span class="accented">de novo</span>, the individuals selected were personally the same. Compare note on chapter Numbers 1:5, and for "the elders of Israel" see on Exodus 3:16. <span class="cmt_word">Whom thou knowest to be elders of the people, and officers over them.</span> On the officers (Hebrew, <span class="accented">shoterim</span>), an ancient order in the national organization of Israel, continued from the days of bondage, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>. The Targ. Pal. paraphrases the word <span class="accented">shoterim</span> by "who were set over them in Mizraim." The Septuagint has here <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, words so familiar to the reader of the Greek Gospels. The later Jews traced back their Sanhedrim, or grand council of seventy, to this appointment, and found their eiders and scribes in this verse. There was, however, no further historical connection between the two bodies than this - that when the monarchy failed and prophecy died out, the ecclesiastical leaders of the Jews modeled their institutions upon, and adapted their titles <span class="accented">to</span>, this Divinely-ordered original. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses heard the people weep, "according to their families, every one before the door of his tent," i.e., heard complaining in all the families in front of every tent, so that the weeping had become universal throughout the whole nation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-12.htm">Zechariah 12:12</a>.), and the wrath of the Lord burned on account of it, and the thing displeased Moses also, he brought his complaint to the Lord. The words "Moses also was displeased," are introduced as a circumstantial clause, to explain the matter more clearly, and show the reason for the complaint which Moses poured out before the Lord, and do not refer exclusively either to the murmuring of the people or to the wrath of Jehovah, but to both together. This follows evidently from the position in which the clause stands between the two antecedent clauses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-10.htm">Numbers 11:10</a> and the apodosis in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-11.htm">Numbers 11:11</a>, and still more evidently from the complaint of Moses which follows. For "the whole attitude of Moses shows that his displeasure was excited not merely by the unrestrained rebellion of the people against Jehovah, but also by the unrestrained wrath of Jehovah against the nation" (Kurtz). But in what was the wrath of Jehovah manifested? It broke out against the people first of all when they had been satiated with flesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a>). There is no mention of any earlier manifestation. Hence Moses can only have discovered a sign of the burning wrath of Jehovah in the fact that, although the discontent of the people burst forth in loud cries, God did not help, but withdrew with His help, and let the whole storm of the infuriated people burst upon him.</body></html>
