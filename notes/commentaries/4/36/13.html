Most of them related to the settlement in Canaan, into which the Israelites were now entering. Whatever new condition God, by his providence, brings us into, we must beg him to teach us the duties of it, and to enable us to do them, that we may do the work of the day in its day, the duty of a place in its place.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto their father's brothers' sons - Or more generally, "unto the sons of their kinsmen."<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. These are the commandments and the judgments, which the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab&#8212;The Israelitish encampment was on an extensive plateau north of the Arnon, which, though wrested from the Moabites by Sihon and Og, still retained the name of its original possessors. The particular site, as indicated by the words "Jordan near Jericho," is now called El-Koura&#8212;a large plain lying not far from Nebo, between the Arnon and a small tributary stream, the Wael [Burckhardt]. It was a desert plain on the eastern bank, and marked only by groves of the wild, thorny acacia tree.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These are the commandments and the judgments,....

A subscription appended to the series of priestly laws related to have been given during the time that Israel was in the land of Moab, i.e. between <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-1.htm" title="And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.">Numbers 22:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-12.htm" title="And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.">Numbers 36:12</a>.

But after that subscription further laws at Sinai are collected in Numbers 1 ff.

This is one of the words which recur so continually in Deuteronomy and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>. It is found four times in chapter 15, and in a few other passages of the earlier books, including <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-34.htm">Leviticus 27:34</a>. The judgments. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. A similar formula is found at the conclusion of Leviticus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-46.htm">Leviticus 26:46</a>), where, however, "the commandments" represents a different word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), and a third term, "the laws" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span>), is added. It is difficult to say confidently what is included under the "these" of this verse. Comparing it with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-50.htm">Numbers 33:50</a>, it would seem that it only referred to the final regulations and enactments of the last four chapters; but as we have no reason to believe that the later sections of the Book are arranged in any methodical order, we cannot limit <span class="accented">its</span> scope to those, or deny that it may include the laws of chapters 28-30. For a similar reason we cannot say that the use of this concluding formula excludes the possibility of further large additions having been subsequently made to the Divine legislation in the same place and by the same person, as recorded in the Book of Deuteronomy. All we can say is, that the Book of Numbers knows nothing about any such additions, and concludes in such sort as to make it a matter of surprise that such additions are afterwards met with. The continuity, which so clearly binds together the main bulk of the four books of Moses, ends with this verse. This fact does not of course decide any question which arises concerning the fifth book; it merely leaves all such questions to be determined on their own merits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Moses declared that what they had affirmed was right (&#1499;&#1468;&#1503;), and then, by command of Jehovah, he told the daughters of Zelophehad that they might marry whoever pleased them (the suffix &#1470;&#1492;&#1501;, attached to &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;, for &#1470;&#1492;&#1503;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-21.htm">Exodus 1:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-9.htm">Genesis 31:9</a>, etc.), but that he must belong to the family of their father's tribe, that is to say, must be a Manassite. For (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-7.htm">Numbers 36:7</a>) the inheritance was not to turn away the Israelites from one tribe to another (not to be transferred from one to another), but every Israelite was to keep to the inheritance of his father's tribe, and no one was to enter upon the possession of another tribe by marrying an heiress belonging to that tribe. This is afterwards extended, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-8.htm">Numbers 36:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-9.htm">Numbers 36:9</a>, into a general law for every heiress in Israel. </body></html>
