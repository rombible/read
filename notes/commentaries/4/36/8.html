God would not have one tribe enriched at the expense of another. Each tribe was to keep to its own inheritance. The daughters of Zelophehad submitted to this appointment. How could they fail to marry well, when God himself directed them? Let the people of God learn how suitable and proper it is, like the daughters of Israel, to be united only to their own people. Ought not every true believer Israel, to be united only to their own people. Ought not every true believer in Jesus, to be very attentive in the near and tender relations of life, to be united only to such as are united to the Lord? All our intentions and inclinations ought to be subjected to the will of God, when that is made known to us, and especially in contracting marriage. Although the word of God allows affection and preference in this important relation, it does not sanction that foolish, ungovernable, and idolatrous passion, which cares not what may be the end; but in defiance of authority, determines upon self-gratification. All such conduct, however disguised, is against common sense, the interests of society, the happiness of the marriage relation, and, what is still more evil, against the religion of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/36.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be taken away - i. e. be permanently taken away. The jubilee year, by not restoring the estate to the tribe to which it originally belonged, would in effect confirm the alienation.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/36.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-12. Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the Lord&#8212;The plea appeared just and reasonable; and, accordingly an enactment was made by which the daughters of Zelophehad, while left to the free choice of their husbands, were restricted to marry not only within their own tribe, but within the family of their father's tribe&#8212;that is, one of their cousins. This restriction, however, was imposed only on those who were heiresses. The law was not applicable to daughters in different circumstances (1Ch 23:22)&#8212;for they might marry into another tribe; but if they did so, they were liable to forfeit their patrimonial inheritance, which, on the death of their father or brothers, went to the nearest of the family kinsmen. Here was an instance of progressive legislation (see also Ex 18:27) in Israel, the enactments made being suggested by circumstances. But it is deserving of special notice that those additions to, or modifications of, the law were confined to civil affairs; while the slightest change was inadmissible in the laws relating to worship or the maintenance of religion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/36.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By which clause it seems that this law was not general to forbid every woman to marry into another tribe, (as may be reasonably concluded from the practice of so many patriarchs, kings, priests, and other holy men, who have married women of other tribes, yea, sometimes of other nations, which it is not likely they would have done, if this had been a transgression of God’s law,) but restrained to heiresses, or such as were likely to be so. See <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-22.htm" title="And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them.">1 Chronicles 23:22</a></span>. But if they had brethren, it is probable they were free to marry into any tribe, yet so that, if their brethren died, their punishment was, that the inheritance went from them to the next akin of their father’s tribe and family. And the principal reason why God was solicitous to preserve tribes and families unmixed was, that the tribe and family too out of which the Messiah was to come, and by which he should be known, might be evident and unquestionable. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/36.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe if the children of Israel,.... For the same law which gave the daughters of Zelophehad right to their father's inheritance, gave every other daughter in Israel a right to inherit where there were no sons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8</a> and every such daughter, according to this law: <p>shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father; marry into her father's tribe and family; by which it appears that such who were not heiresses might marry persons of another family, and even of another tribe: <p>that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers; of his father's brethren, or of those that are near akin to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/36.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And every daughter, that possesseth an <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.</span><p>(e) When there is no male to inherit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The occasion for this law was a representation made to Moses and the princes of the congregation by the heads of the fathers' houses (&#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-25.htm">Exodus 6:25</a>, etc.) of the family of Gilead the Manassite, to which Zelophehad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-33.htm">Numbers 26:33</a>) belonged, to the effect that, by allotting an hereditary possession to the daughters of Zelophehad, the tribe-territory assigned to the Manassites would be diminished if they should marry into another tribe. They founded their appeal upon the command of Jehovah, that the land was to be distributed by lot among the Israelites for an inheritance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-2.htm">Numbers 36:2</a> compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55-56</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>); and although it is not expressly stated, yet on the ground of the promise of the everlasting possession of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>), and the provision made by the law, that an inheritance was not to be alienated (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-10.htm">Leviticus 25:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-13.htm">Leviticus 25:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>.), they understood it as signifying that the portion assigned to each tribe was to continue unchanged to all generations. (The singular pronoun, my Lord, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-2.htm">Numbers 36:2</a>, refers to the speaker, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-27.htm">Numbers 32:27</a>.) Now, as the inheritance of their brother, i.e., their tribe-mate Zelophehad, had been given to his daughters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a>), if they should be chosen as wives by any of the children of the (other) tribes of Israel, i.e., should marry into another tribe, their inheritance would be taken away from the tribe-territory of Manasseh, and would be added to that of the tribe into which they were received. The suffix &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-3.htm">Numbers 36:3</a>) refers ad sensum to &#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1492;, the tribe regarded according to its members. </body></html>
