It appears, De 1:22, that the motion to search out the land came from the people. They had a better opinion of their own policy than of God's wisdom. Thus we ruin ourselves by believing the reports and representations of sense rather than Divine revelation. We walk by sight not by faith. Moses gave the spies this charge, Be of good courage. It was not only a great undertaking they were put upon, which required good management and resolution; but a great trust was reposed in them, which required that they should be faithful. Courage in such circumstances can only spring from strong faith, which Caleb and Joshua alone possessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A ruler - A comparison of the list with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-1.htm">Numbers 13:1</a> :5 following shows that they were not the princes of the tribes, but heads of houses or families <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-4.htm">Numbers 12:4</a>.<p>Of the names here given those of Joshua and Caleb alone are otherwise known to us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. those men were heads of the children of Israel&#8212;Not the princes who are named (Nu 10:14-16, 18-20, 22-27), but chiefs, leading men though not of the first rank.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses, by the commandment of the Lord,....

The connection of the particle &#1504;&#1488; with &#1488;&#1500; is certainly unusual, but yet it is analogous to the construction with such exclamations as &#1488;&#1493;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-31.htm">Jeremiah 4:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/45-3.htm">Jeremiah 45:3</a>) and &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-11.htm">Genesis 12:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a>, etc.); since &#1488;&#1500; in the vocative is to be regarded as equivalent to an exclamation; whereas the alteration into &#1488;&#1500;, as proposed by J. D. Michaelis and Knobel, does not even give a fitting sense, apart altogether from the fact, that the repetition of &#1504;&#1488; after the verb, with &#1504;&#1488; &#1488;&#1500; before it, would be altogether unexampled. </body></html>
