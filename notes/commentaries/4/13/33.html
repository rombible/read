But they distrusted God's power and promise. How much we stand in our own light by our unbelief! At length the messengers returned; but the greater part discouraged the people from going forward to Canaan. Justly are the Israelites left to this temptation, for putting confidence in the judgment of men, when they had the word of God to trust in. Though they had found the land as good as God had said, yet they would not believe it to be as sure as he had said, but despaired of having it, though Eternal Truth had engaged it to them. This was the representation of the evil spies. Caleb, however, encouraged them to go forward, though seconded by Joshua only. He does not say, Let us go up and conquer it; but, Let us go and possess it. Difficulties that are in the way of salvation, dwindle and vanish before a lively, active faith in the power and promise of God. All things are possible, if they are promised, to him that believes; but carnal sense and carnal professors are not to be trusted. Unbelief overlooks the promises and power of God, magnifies every danger and difficulty, and fills the heart with discouragement. May the Lord help us to believe! we shall then find all things possible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A land that eateth up ... - i. e. it is a land which from its position is exposed to incessant attacks from one quarter and another, and so its occupants must be always armed and watchful. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak&#8212;The name is derived from the son of Arba, a great man among the Arabians (Jos 15:14), who probably obtained his appellation from wearing a splendid collar or chain round his neck, as the word imports.

The derivation and meaning of the name are obscure. Aq. [Note: q. The Greek translation by Aquila.] <span class="greekheb">ἐπιπίπτοντες</span> (‘falling upon’) connects it with <span class="ital">nâphal</span> (<span class="greekheb">נפל</span>) ‘to fall,’ as though the name described the violence with which the Nephilim <span class="ital">fell upon</span> their enemies. But LXX. <span class="greekheb">γίγαντες</span> (‘giants’) and Sym. <span class="greekheb">βιαῖοι</span> (‘violent’) are only paraphrases. The name appears to be a relic of primitive mythology, but little more can be said of it. If the Nephilim were thought of as superhuman or semi-divine beings, the spies may have used the name to heighten the effect of their description of the ‘sons of Anak’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-28.htm" title="Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.">Numbers 13:28</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the sons of Anak, which come of the Nephilim</span>] <span class="ital">the sons of Anak</span> are <span class="ital">of the Nephilim</span>.

The Nephilim are, without doubt, the primaeval tyrants mentioned under that name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>. The renown of these sons of violence had come down from those dim ages, and the exaggerated fears of the spies saw them revived in the gigantic forms of the Beni-Anak. There is no certainty that the Nephilim had been giants, and no likelihood whatever that the Beni-Anak had any real connection with them. As grasshoppers. We have no means of judging of the actual size of these men, unless the height assigned to Goliath (six cubits and a span) be allowed to them. Probably men of this stature were quite exceptional even among the Anakim.
