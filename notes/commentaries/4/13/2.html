It appears, De 1:22, that the motion to search out the land came from the people. They had a better opinion of their own policy than of God's wisdom. Thus we ruin ourselves by believing the reports and representations of sense rather than Divine revelation. We walk by sight not by faith. Moses gave the spies this charge, Be of good courage. It was not only a great undertaking they were put upon, which required good management and resolution; but a great trust was reposed in them, which required that they should be faithful. Courage in such circumstances can only spring from strong faith, which Caleb and Joshua alone possessed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A ruler - A comparison of the list with that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-1.htm">Numbers 13:1</a> :5 following shows that they were not the princes of the tribes, but heads of houses or families <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-4.htm">Numbers 12:4</a>.<p>Of the names here given those of Joshua and Caleb alone are otherwise known to us. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 13<p>Nu 13:1-33.

Of the following 24 names, beside Joshua, Nun, Caleb and Jephunneh, a few are found in early times, e.g. Palti (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-44.htm" title="But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.">1 Samuel 25:44</a>), Ammiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-4.htm" title="And the king said to him, Where is he? And Ziba said to the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.">2 Samuel 9:4</a>), Shaphat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.">1 Kings 19:16</a>), Shammua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-14.htm" title="And these be the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,">2 Samuel 5:14</a>), Igal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-36.htm" title="Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,">2 Samuel 23:36</a>); in the last two cases, however, the text is uncertain. Others appear to be late. It is probable that the list is artificial, and not based on historical tradition. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-5.htm" title="And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.">Numbers 1:5</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Send thou men, that they may search the land.</span> If this account of the mission of the spies be compared with that given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20-25</a>, it may be seen in a striking instance how entirely different a colour may be put upon the same circumstances by two inspired narratives. No one indeed will affirm that the two records are contradictory, or even inconsistent, and yet they leave an entirely different impression upon the mind; and no doubt were intended to. It is important to note that the Divine inspiration did not in the least prevent two sacred authors (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>), or even the same author at different times, from placing on record very distinct and even strongly contrasted aspects of the same facts, according to the point of view from which he was led to regard them. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1.htm">Deuteronomy 1</a>, Moses reminds the people that on their arrival at Kadesh he had bidden them go up and take possession; that <span class="accented">they</span> had then proposed to send men before them to examine the land; that the proposal had pleased him so well that he had adopted it and acted upon it. It is unquestionably strange that facts so material should have been omitted in the historical Book of Numbers. It is, however, to be considered - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That there is no contradiction between the two accounts. We may be certain from many a recorded example that Moses would not have acted on the popular suggestion without referring the matter to the Lord, and that it would be the Divine command (when given) which would really weigh with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the recital in Deuteronomy is distinctly <span class="accented">ad populum</span>, and that therefore their part in the whole transaction is as strongly emphasized as is consistent with the truth of the facts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That the narrative of Numbers is fragmentary, and does not profess to give a full account of matters, especially in such particulars  as do not directly concern the Divine government and guidance of Israel. It is not, therefore, a serious difficulty that the record only begins here at the point when God adopted as his own what had been the demand of the people. If we ask why he so adopted it, the probable answer is that he knew what secret disaffection prompted it, and to what open rebellion it would lead. It was better that such disaffection should be allowed to ripen into rebellion before they entered their promised land. Miserable as the desert wandering might be, it was yet a discipline which prepared the nation for better things; whereas the invasion of Canaan without strong faith, courage, and self-restraint (such as they showed under Joshua) could but have ended in national disaster and destruction. <span class="cmt_word">Of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man.</span> This was not part of the original proposition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-22.htm">Deuteronomy 1:22</a>), but was agreeable to the general practice in matters of national concern, and was no doubt commanded in order that the whole people might share in the interest and responsibility of this survey. Every one a ruler among them. This does not mean that they were to be the tribe princes (as the names show), for they would not be suitable in respect of age, nor could they be spared for this service. They were "heads of the children of Israel" (verse 3), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, men of position and repute, but also no doubt comparatively young and active, as befitted a toilsome and hazardous excursion. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Aaron saw his sister smitten in this way, he said to Moses, "Alas! my lord, I beseech thee, lay not this sin upon us, for we have done foolishly;" i.e., let us not bear its punishment. "Let her (Miriam) not be as the dead thing, on whose coming out of its mother's womb half its flesh is consumed;" i.e., like a still-born child, which comes into the world half decomposed. His reason for making this comparison was, that leprosy produces decomposition in the living body. </body></html>
