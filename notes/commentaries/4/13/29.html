But they distrusted God's power and promise. How much we stand in our own light by our unbelief! At length the messengers returned; but the greater part discouraged the people from going forward to Canaan. Justly are the Israelites left to this temptation, for putting confidence in the judgment of men, when they had the word of God to trust in. Though they had found the land as good as God had said, yet they would not believe it to be as sure as he had said, but despaired of having it, though Eternal Truth had engaged it to them. This was the representation of the evil spies. Caleb, however, encouraged them to go forward, though seconded by Joshua only. He does not say, Let us go up and conquer it; but, Let us go and possess it. Difficulties that are in the way of salvation, dwindle and vanish before a lively, active faith in the power and promise of God. All things are possible, if they are promised, to him that believes; but carnal sense and carnal professors are not to be trusted. Unbelief overlooks the promises and power of God, magnifies every danger and difficulty, and fills the heart with discouragement. May the Lord help us to believe! we shall then find all things possible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Amalekites - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a> note.<p>The Canaanites - i. e. those of the Phoenician race: the word is here used in its narrow sense: compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15-18</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

On the southern side of the land of Canaan: not in it, for they were not Canaanites, but neighbours to them, and lay nearest to the camp of Israel, and at the entrance into the land of Canaan; and as they were enemies of Israel, as appears from an attack upon them quickly after they came from the Red sea, in Rephidim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8</a>; and friends to the Canaanites, they would no doubt oppose their passage into their land, as they did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-43.htm">Numbers 14:43</a>; this is one difficulty in the way of possessing the land hinted at, others follow: <p>and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains; and guard the passes there; so that should they escape the Amalekites, or get the better of them, they would not be able to pass the mountains, being so well inhabited and defended; the Hittites seem to dwell about Mount Lebanon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>; the Jebusites inhabited the mountains about Jerusalem, and that itself, which was called by them Jebus, and from which they were not dispossessed until the times of David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-4.htm">1 Chronicles 11:4</a>; and the Amorites were possessed of the mountain which was on the borders of the land, next to the place where Israel now were, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20</a>, <p>and the Canaanites dwell by the sea; these dwelt both on the east and on the west of the land, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>; so that the western Canaanites dwelt on the shore of the Mediterranean sea, which is often put for the west in Scripture; and the eastern Canaanites dwelt by the Dead sea, or by the sea of Tiberias, called sometimes the lake of Gennesaret, and seems the rather to be meant here by what follows: <p>and by the coast of Jordan; so that this river was not passable by them; for by all this they would suggest that all avenues and passes were stopped up, so that it was a vain thing to attempt entrance into the land, or to expect ever to possess it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>.

They are not numbered among the inhabitants of Canaan proper. <span class="cmt_word">The Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.</span> It is not easy to say in what sense the word "Canaanites" is used here. At one time it is the name of one tribe amongst many, all descended from Canaan, the son of Ham, which dwelt in the land of promise; at another time it is apparently synonymous with "Amorites," or rather includes both them and the allied tribes (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-9.htm">Judges 1:9</a>). It is possible, though far from certain, that "Canaanites" in this place may mean "Phoenicians," since Sidon was the first-born of Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>), and the northern portion of the maritime plain was certainly in their possession, and probably the upper part of the Ghor, or coast of Jordan. It would appear that the Philistines had not at this time made themselves masters of the plain, although they dwelt in some parts of it (see on Exodus 13:17). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The spies also came into the valley of Eshcol, where they gathered pomegranates and figs, and also cut down a vine-branch with grapes upon it, which two persons carried upon a pole, most likely on account of its extraordinary size. Bunches of grapes are still met with in Palestine, weighing as much as eight, ten, or twelve pounds, the grapes themselves being as large as our smaller plums (cf. Tobler Denkbltter, pp. 111, 112). The grapes of Hebron are especially celebrated. To the north of this city, on the way to Jerusalem, you pass through a valley with vineyards on the hills on both sides, containing the largest and finest grapes in the land, and with pomegranates, figs, and other fruits in great profusion (Robinson, Palestine, i. 316, compared with i. 314 and ii. 442). This valley is supposed, and not without good ground, to be the Eshcol of this chapter, which received its name of Eshcol (cluster of grapes), according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-24.htm">Numbers 13:24</a>, from the bunch of grapes which was cut down there by the spies. This statement, of course, applies to the Israelites, and would therefore still hold good, even if the conjecture were a well-founded one, that this valley received its name originally from the Eshcol mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-24.htm">Genesis 14:24</a>, as the terebinth grove did from Mamre the brother of Eshcol. </body></html>
