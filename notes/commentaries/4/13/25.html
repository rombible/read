But they distrusted God, and chose to be held in suspense by their own counsels, rather than to rest upon God’s promise!

Its location was a little to the southwest of Hebron. The valley and its sloping hills are still covered with vineyards, the character of whose fruit corresponds to its ancient celebrity.<p>and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes&#8212;The grapes reared in this locality are still as magnificent as formerly&#8212;they are said by one to be equal in size to prunes, and compared by another to a man's thumb. One cluster sometimes weighs ten or twelve pounds. The mode of carrying the cluster cut down by the spies, though not necessary from its weight, was evidently adopted to preserve it entire as a specimen of the productions of the promised land; and the impression made by the sight of it would be all the greater because the Israelites were familiar only with the scanty vines and small grapes of Egypt.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they returned from searching the land after forty days.

All this they were to search out courageously (&#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;, to show one's self courageous in any occupation), and to fetch (some) of the fruits of the land, as it was the time of the first-ripe grapes. In Palestine the first grapes ripen as early as August, and sometimes even in July (vid., Robinson, ii. 100, ii. 611), whilst the vintage takes place in September and October. </body></html>
