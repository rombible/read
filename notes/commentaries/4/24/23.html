Balaam boasts that his eyes are open. The prophets were in old times called seers. He had heard the words of God, which many do who neither heed them, nor hear God in them. He knew the knowledge of the Most High. A man may be full of the knowledge of God, yet utterly destitute of the grace of God. He calls God the Most High and the Almighty. No man could seem to express a greater respect to God; yet he had no true fear of him, love to him, nor faith in him; so far a man may go toward heaven, and yet come short of it at last. Here is Balaam's prophecy concerning Him who should be the crown and glory of his people Israel; who is David in the type; but our Lord Jesus, the promised Messiah, is chiefly pointed at, and of him it is an illustrious prophecy. Balaam, a wicked man, shall see Christ, but shall not see him nigh; not see him as Job, who saw him as his Redeemer, and saw him for himself. When he comes in the clouds, every eye shall see him; but many will see him, as the rich man in hell saw Abraham, afar off. He shall come out of Jacob, and Israel, as a Star and a Sceptre; the former denoting his glory and lustre; the latter his power and authority. Christ shall be King, not only of Jacob and Israel, but of all the world; so that all shall be either governed by his golden sceptre, or dashed in pieces by his iron rod. Balaam prophesied concerning the Amalekites and Kenites, part of whose country he had now in view. Even a nest in a rock will not be a lasting security. Here is a prophecy that looks as far forward as to the Greeks and Romans. He acknowledges all the revolutions of states and kingdoms to be the Lord's doing. These events will make such desolations, that scarcely any will escape. They that live then, will be as brands plucked out of the fire. May God fit us for the worst of times! Thus Balaam, instead of cursing the church, curses Amalek the first, and Rome the last enemy of the church. Not Rome pagan only, but Rome papal also; antichrist and all the antichristian powers. Let us ask ourselves, Do we in knowledge, experience, or profession, excel Balaam? No readiness of speech, even in preaching or prayer, no gifts of knowledge or prophecy, are in themselves different from, or superior to the boasted gifts of him who loved the wages of unrighteousness, and died the enemy of God. Simple dependence on the Redeemer's atoning blood and sanctifying grace, cheerful submission to the Divine will, constant endeavours to glorify God and benefit his people, these are less splendid, but far more excellent gifts, and always accompany salvation. No boasting hypocrite ever possessed these; yet the feeblest believer has something of them, and is daily praying for more of them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When God doeth this - The eventual carrying away of the allies of Israel by Assyria presented itself to Balaam as the ruin of all peace and safety upon earth.

"I see Him, yet not now; I behold Him, but not nigh. A star appears out of Jacob, and a sceptre rises out of Israel, and dashes Moab in pieces on both sides, and destroys all the sons of confusion." The suffixes to &#1488;&#1512;&#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; refer to the star which is mentioned afterwards, and which Balaam sees in spirit, but "not now," i.e., not as having already appeared, and "not nigh," i.e., not to appear immediately, but to come forth out of Israel in the far distant future. "A star is so natural an image and symbol of imperial greatness and splendour, that it has been employed in this sense in almost every nation. And the fact that this figure and symbol are so natural, may serve to explain the belief of the ancient world, that the birth and accession of great kings was announced by the appearance of stars" (Hengstenberg, who cites Justini hist. xxxvii. 2; Plinii h. n. ii. 23; Sueton. Jul. Caes. c. 78; and Dio Cass. xlv. p. 273). If, however, there could be any doubt that the rising star represented the appearance of a glorious ruler or king, it would be entirely removed by the parallel, "a sceptre arises out of Israel." The sceptre, which was introduced as a symbol of dominion even in Jacob's blessing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), is employed here as the figurative representation and symbol of the future ruler in Israel. This ruler would destroy all the enemies of Israel. Moab and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>) Edom are the first of these that are mentioned, viz., the two nations that were related to Israel by descent, but had risen up in hostility against it at that time. Moab stands in the foremost rank, not merely because Balaam was about to announce to the king of Moab what Israel would do to his people in the future, but also because the hostility of the heathen to the people of God had appeared most strongly in Balak's desire to curse the Israelites. &#1502;&#1493;&#1488;&#1489; &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, "the two corners or sides of Moab," equivalent to Moab on both sides, from one end to the other. For &#1511;&#1512;&#1511;&#1512;, the inf. Pilp. of &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; or &#1511;&#1497;&#1512;, the meaning to destroy is fully established by the parallel &#1502;&#1495;&#1509;, and by <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>, whatever may be thought of its etymology and primary meaning. And neither the Samaritan text nor the passage in Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>), which is based upon this prophecy, at all warrants an alteration of the reading &#1511;&#1512;&#1511;&#1512; into &#1511;&#1491;&#1511;&#1491; (the crown of the head), since Jeremiah almost invariably uses earlier writing in this free manner, viz., by altering the expressions employed, and substituting in the place of unusual words wither more common ones, or such as are similar in sound (cf. Kper, Jerem. libror, ss. interpres atque vindex, pp. xii.ff. and p. 43). - &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; does not mean "all the sons of Seth," i.e., all mankind, as the human race is never called by the name of Seth; and the idea that the ruler to arise out of Israel would destroy all men, would be altogether unsuitable. It signifies rather "all the sons of confusion," by which, according to the analogy of Jacob and Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>), Edom and Seir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a>), the Moabites are to be understood as being men of wild, warlike confusion. &#1513;&#1473;&#1514; is a contraction of &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-47.htm">Lamentations 3:47</a>), and derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1492;; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a> it is correctly rendered &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;.<p>(Note: On the other hand, the rendering, "all the sons of the drinker, i.e., of Lot," which Hiller proposed, and v. Hoffmann and Kurtz have renewed, is evidently untenable. For, in the first place, the fact related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-32.htm">Genesis 19:32</a>. does not warrant the assumption that Lot ever received the name of the "drinker," especially as the word used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a> is not &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1492;, but &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1492;. Moreover, the allusion to "all the sons of Lot," i.e., the Moabites and Ammonites, neither suits the thoroughly synonymous parallelism in the saying of Balaam, nor corresponds to the general character of his prophecies, which announced destruction primarily only to those nations that rose up in hostility against Israel, viz., Moab, Edom, and Amalek, whereas hitherto the Ammonites had not assumed either a hostile or friendly attitude towards them. And lastly, all the nations doomed to destruction are mentioned by name. Now the Ammonites were not a branch of the Moabites by descent, nor was their territory enclosed within the Moabitish territory, so that it could be included, as Hoffmann supposes, within the "four corners of Moab.")<p>In the announcement of destruction which is to fall upon the enemies of Israel through the star and sceptre out of the midst of it, Moab is followed by "its southern neighbour Edom." </body></html>
