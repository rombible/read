Now this might be said to Balak to make him easy, that it would not be until the latter days, many hundreds of years hence, ere the people of Israel would fight with Moab, and subdue it; and therefore he need be under no concern about them, since he would meet with no trouble from them in his time, nor his people for years to come. <p>(b) Antiqu. l. 13. c. 13. sect. 5. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And now, behold, I go unto my people: come <i>therefore, and</i> I will <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.</span><p>(h) He gave also wicked counsel to cause the Israelites to sin, that God might forsake them, Nu 31:16.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">I will advertise thee</span>] <span class="ital">I will</span> <span class="bld">counsel</span> <span class="ital">thee</span>. ‘Advertise’ is an archaism, meaning ‘inform’; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-4.htm" title="And I thought to advertise you, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people.

The Vulgate here has followed the surmise of the Jewish commentators, who saw nothing in Balaam but the arch-enemy of their race, and has actually altered the text into "dabo consilium quid populus tuus populo huic faciat" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/31-16.htm">Numbers 31:16</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-8.htm">Numbers 24:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>, Balaam proclaims still further: "God leads him out of Egypt; his strength is as that of a buffalo: he will devour nations his enemies, and crush their bones, and dash them in pieces with his arrows. He has encamped, he lies down like a lion, and like a lioness: who can drive him up? Blessed be they who bless thee, and cursed they who curse thee!" The fulness of power that dwelt in the people of Israel was apparent in the force and prowess with which their God brought them out of Egypt. This fact Balaam repeats from the previous saying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22</a>), for the purpose of linking on to it the still further announcement of the manner in which the power of the nation would show itself upon its foes in time to come. The words, "he will devour nations," call up the image of a lion, which is employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a> to depict the indomitable heroic power of Israel, in words taken from Jacob's blessing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>. The Piel &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; is a denom. verb from &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, with the meaning to destroy, crush the bones, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, to root out (cf. Ges. 52, 2; Ewald, 120, e.). &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; is not the object to &#1497;&#1502;&#1495;&#1509;; for &#1502;&#1495;&#1509;, to dash to pieces, does not apply to arrows, which may be broken in pieces, but not dashed to pieces; and the singular suffix in &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; can only apply to the singular idea in the verse, i.e., to Israel, and not to its enemies, who are spoken of in the plural. Arrows are singled out as representing weapons in general.<p>(Note: The difficulty which many feel in connection with the word &#1495;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493; cannot be removed by alterations of the text. The only possible conjecture &#1495;&#1500;&#1510;&#1497;&#1493; (his loins) is wrecked upon the singular suffix, for the dashing to pieces of the loins of Israel is not for a moment to be thought of. Knobel's proposal, viz., to read &#1511;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493;, has no support in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-11.htm">Deuteronomy 33:11</a>, and is much too violent to reckon upon any approval.)<p>Balaam closes this utterance, as he had done the previous one, with a quotation from Jacob's blessing, which he introduces to show to Balak, that, according to words addressed by Jehovah to the Israelites through their own tribe-father, they were to overcome their foes so thoroughly, that none of them should venture to rise up against them again. To this he also links on the words with which Isaac had transferred to Jacob in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-29.htm">Genesis 27:29</a> the blessing of Abraham in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, for the purpose of warning Balak to desist from his enmity against the chosen people of God. </body></html>
