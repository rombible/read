On the contrary, the sacred historian informs us, that he retired both times, not to meet evil spirits, and receive communications from them, but to meet JEHOVAH, and receive intimations of his will, saying to Balak on the first occasion, <span class="ital">Whatsoever he showeth me I will tell thee. </span>And both times we read that <span class="ital">Jehovah put a word in Balaam’s mouth. </span>All, therefore, that we can reasonably conclude from the passage before us is, that Balaam omitted to do now what he had done before. <span class="ital">He went not — </span>Retired not, as he had done the former times, for <span class="ital">the meeting, </span>or <span class="ital">obtaining of divinations, </span>that is, for the purpose of obtaining information from the Lord concerning future things, or to make inquiries about them. M. Saurin seems to be clearly of this opinion, and to consider the expression as signifying no more here than “the revelations which Balsam desired of God concerning the destiny of the Israelites.” Houbigant is of the same mind, observing that the word <span class="greekheb">נחשׁים</span><span class="ital">nechashim, auguries, </span>is here to be understood in a good sense, because Balaam interpreted the will of the <span class="ital">true God, </span>and not the will of the god of Moab, from these auguries. Thus also Le Clerc, paraphrasing the passage, says, “He judged it superfluous to inquire further into the mind of God, as God had sufficiently declared his purpose to bless Israel.” Indeed, as Christ is known to have no communion with Belial, it seems strange that any Christian should ever have imagined that God would thus have made known his will, and thus lay open the secrets of futurity, to a man that had or attempted to have intercourse with evil spirits. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-19.htm" title="And when they shall say to you, Seek to them that have familiar spirits, and to wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek to their God? for the living to the dead?">Isaiah 8:19</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-25.htm" title="That frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad; that turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;">Isaiah 44:25</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-12.htm" title="Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, wherein you have labored from your youth; if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail.">Isaiah 47:12</a>. <span class="ital">He set his face toward the wilderness — </span>Where Israel lay encamped, expecting what God, of his own accord, would suggest to him concerning this matter.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 Now Balaam spake not his own sense, but the language of the Spirit that came upon him. Many have their eyes open who have not their hearts open; are enlightened, but not sanctified. That knowledge which puffs men up with pride, will but serve to light them to hell, whither many go with their eyes open. The blessing is nearly the same as those given before. He admires in Israel, their beauty. The righteous, doubtless, is more excellent than his neighbour. Their fruitfulness and increase. Their honour and advancement. Their power and victory. He looks back upon what had been done for them. Their power and victory. He looks back upon what had been done for them. Their courage and security. The righteous are bold as a lion, not when assaulting others, but when at rest, because God maketh them to dwell in safety. Their influence upon their neighbours.

That it was good in his sight, what he approved of, and was well-pleasing to him, and that it was his determined mind that Israel should be blessed, and not cursed, from which there was no turning him, by offering sacrifices to him, and much less by his sorceries and divinations: <p>he went not as at other times; or, "as at a time in a time" (q), at two times, of which see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-3.htm">Numbers 23:3</a>, he abode in the place where the sacrifices were offered, and did not depart to another at some distance, as he had twice before done: <p>to seek for enchantments; which it seems he used before, for he not only offered sacrifices to the true God, which yet were attended with superstitious rites, but he made use of his divining art also; and not only went to meet with God, and hear what he would say to him, but consulted the devil also, being willing to have two strings to his bow, and that, if possible, he might carry his point, and get what his covetous and ambitious mind was desirous of: the words may be literally rendered, "to meet enchantments" (r); but what should be meant by the phrase is not easy to say; I should rather choose to render them, "to meet serpents", and make use of them in his divinations, make observations on them, and predictions from them: one sort of divination is called "ophiomancy", or divining by serpents; so Calchas, on seeing a serpent devour eight sparrows with their dam, foretold the duration of the siege of Troy (s): <p>but he set his face towards the wilderness: where the people of Israel lay encamped, not with an intention to bless them, though he saw it pleased the Lord, but to take an opportunity, if he could, without his leave, to curse them; and therefore he did not go out as he did before, to know his will, but stood by the sacrifice, with his face to the wilderness, where the people were, to take any advantage that offered. <p>(q)  "sicut vice in vice", Montanus, Vatablus.

As one of the commonest and worst of heathen practices, it was forbidden to Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>) and held up to reprobation, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Toward the wilderness.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>.

Balak was not deterred, however, from making another attempt. At first, indeed, he exclaimed in indignation at these second sayings of Balaam: "Thou shalt neither curse it, nor even bless." The double &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; with &#1500;&#1488; signifies "neither - nor;" and the rendering, "if thou do not curse it, thou shalt not bless it," must be rejected as untenable. In his vexation at the second failure, he did not want to hear anything more from Balaam. But when he replied again, that he had told him at the very outset that he could do nothing but what God should say to him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-38.htm">Numbers 22:38</a>), he altered his mind, and resolved to conduct Balaam to another place with this hope: "peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence." Clericus observes upon this passage, "It was the opinion of the heathen, that what was not obtained through the first, second, or third victim, might nevertheless be secured through a fourth;" and he adduces proofs from Suetonius, Curtius, Gellius, and others. </body></html>
