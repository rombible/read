It has been supposed that the Amalekites separated themselves at a very early period from the rest of the Edomites. The word <span class= "ital">reshith, </span>which is here rendered “first,” may denote priority in rank, but more frequently denotes priority in time. The corresponding word in the second clause of the verse, aharith (latter end), may be thought to denote that the reference is to time, not to rank. On the other hand, the reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-7.htm" title="He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.">Numbers 24:7</a> to the kings of the Amalekites may be urged in favour of the reference to rank. Some understand the allusion to be to the fact that the Amalekites were the first nation which attacked Israel when they had come out of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm" title="Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.">Exodus 17:8</a>). It is possible, however, that there may be a reference both to time and to rank. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm" title="Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!">Amos 6:1</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">But his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.—</span>Or, <span class= "ital">come to destruction. </span>More literally, <span class= "ital">But his latter end shall be even to one perishing</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>he shall come to the position of one who is perishing. The destruction of the Amalekites began in the reign of Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-48.htm" title="And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.">1Samuel 14:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm" title="And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until you come to Shur, that is over against Egypt.">1Samuel 15:7</a>), was continued by David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-8.htm" title="And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.">1Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-17.htm" title="And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode on camels, and fled.">1Samuel 30:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-12.htm" title="Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.">2Samuel 8:12</a>), and was completed by Hezekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/4-42.htm" title="And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.">1Chronicles 4:42-43</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-20.htm" title="And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.">Numbers 24:20</a></span>. <span class="ital">He looked upon Amalek — </span>From the top of Pisgah, which was exceeding high, and gave him the prospect of part of all these kingdoms, he turned his eyes from the Moabites more to the south and west, and looked on their neighbours the Amalekites. <span class="ital">Amalek was the first of the nations — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">the beginning, </span>or <span class="ital">first-fruits, </span>so called, either because they were the first of all the neighbouring nations which were imbodied together in one government, or because they were the first who fought against Israel and were vanquished by them. That victory was an earnest and first-fruit of the large harvest of victories which the Israelites should, in due time, get over all their enemies. “The Amalekites appear to have been a very ancient nation. They are mentioned as early as the wars of Chedorlaomer, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-7.htm" title="And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelled in Hazezontamar.">Genesis 14:7</a>,) and therefore must have been a nation before the times of Abraham and Lot, and consequently much older than the Moabites or Edomites, or any of the nations descended from those patriarchs. But though they were the most ancient and powerful of the neighbouring nations, yet, says Balaam, <span class="ital">their latter end shall be that they perish for ever —</span> Here he confirms what God had before denounced by Moses: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.">Exodus 17:14</a>. Balaam had before declared that the king of Israel should prevail over the king of Amalek; but here the menace is carried further, and Amalek is consigned to utter destruction. And this sentence was in a great measure executed by Saul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-7.htm" title="And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until you come to Shur, that is over against Egypt.">1 Samuel 15:7</a>; afterward more fully by David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/27-8.htm" title="And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt....">1 Samuel 27:8-9</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;">1 Samuel 30:1</a>. And at last, in the days of Hezekiah, <span class="ital">the sons of Simeon smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped, </span>and dwelt in <span class="ital">their habitations, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/4-41.htm" title="And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly to this day, and dwelled in their rooms: because there was pasture there for their flocks....">1 Chronicles 4:41-43</a>. And where is the name or nation of Amalek subsisting at this day? What history, what tradition of them is remaining anywhere? They are but just enough known and remembered to show that what God hath threatened he hath punctually fulfilled.” How incontrovertible is the argument arising from hence in favour not only of the truth of Balaam’s prophecy, but of the assurance which Moses had of its truth, and of the certainty of its accomplishment, inasmuch as he recorded it while Amalek was yet a very powerful nation, and thereby risked on its truth and fulfilment all his credit as an historian and his authority as a lawgiver and messenger of God!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:15-25 Under the powerful influence of the Spirit of prophecy, Balaam foretold the future prosperity and extensive dominion of Israel. Balaam boasts that his eyes are open. The prophets were in old times called seers. He had heard the words of God, which many do who neither heed them, nor hear God in them. He knew the knowledge of the Most High. A man may be full of the knowledge of God, yet utterly destitute of the grace of God. He calls God the Most High and the Almighty. No man could seem to express a greater respect to God; yet he had no true fear of him, love to him, nor faith in him; so far a man may go toward heaven, and yet come short of it at last. Here is Balaam's prophecy concerning Him who should be the crown and glory of his people Israel; who is David in the type; but our Lord Jesus, the promised Messiah, is chiefly pointed at, and of him it is an illustrious prophecy. Balaam, a wicked man, shall see Christ, but shall not see him nigh; not see him as Job, who saw him as his Redeemer, and saw him for himself. When he comes in the clouds, every eye shall see him; but many will see him, as the rich man in hell saw Abraham, afar off. He shall come out of Jacob, and Israel, as a Star and a Sceptre; the former denoting his glory and lustre; the latter his power and authority. Christ shall be King, not only of Jacob and Israel, but of all the world; so that all shall be either governed by his golden sceptre, or dashed in pieces by his iron rod. Balaam prophesied concerning the Amalekites and Kenites, part of whose country he had now in view. Even a nest in a rock will not be a lasting security. Here is a prophecy that looks as far forward as to the Greeks and Romans. He acknowledges all the revolutions of states and kingdoms to be the Lord's doing. These events will make such desolations, that scarcely any will escape. They that live then, will be as brands plucked out of the fire. May God fit us for the worst of times! Thus Balaam, instead of cursing the church, curses Amalek the first, and Rome the last enemy of the church. Not Rome pagan only, but Rome papal also; antichrist and all the antichristian powers. Let us ask ourselves, Do we in knowledge, experience, or profession, excel Balaam? No readiness of speech, even in preaching or prayer, no gifts of knowledge or prophecy, are in themselves different from, or superior to the boasted gifts of him who loved the wages of unrighteousness, and died the enemy of God. Simple dependence on the Redeemer's atoning blood and sanctifying grace, cheerful submission to the Divine will, constant endeavours to glorify God and benefit his people, these are less splendid, but far more excellent gifts, and always accompany salvation. No boasting hypocrite ever possessed these; yet the feeblest believer has something of them, and is daily praying for more of them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When he looked - i. e., in spirit, as he saw the Star <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>.<p>Amalek was the first of the nations - Rather, is pre-eminent among the neighboring nations: compare the same expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>.

The first of the nations. Amalek was in no sense a leading nation, nor was it a very ancient nation. It was indeed the very first of the nations to attack Israel, but it is a most arbitrary treatment of the words to understand them in that sense. The prophet Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>) uses the same expression of the Jewish aristocracy of his day. As it was in no better position than Amalek to claim it in any true sense, we can but suppose that in either case there is a reference to the vainglorious vauntings of the people threatened; it would be quite in keeping with the Bedawin character if Amalek gave himself out be "the first of nations." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But Balaam reminds him, on the other hand, of the declaration which he made to the messengers at the very outset (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a>), that he could not on any account speak in opposition to the command of Jehovah, and then adds, "And now, behold, I go to my people.
