It occurs in the Pentateuch only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm" title="And said, By myself have I sworn, said the LORD, for because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son:">Genesis 22:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-28.htm" title="Say to them, As truly as I live, said the LORD, as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:">Numbers 14:28</a>, and in this chapter, where it is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/24-3.htm" title="And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:">Numbers 24:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/24-15.htm" title="And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor has said, and the man whose eyes are open has said:">Numbers 24:15-16</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The man whose eyes are open.—</span>There is great diversity of opinion respecting the meaning of the word which is here rendered <span class= "ital">open, </span>and which, as it is here written, occurs in no other place. If <span class= "ital">shatham </span>is identified with <span class= "ital">satham, </span>it means to close, not to open. The meaning, however, of this verse is sufficiently explained by that which follows, whichever rendering of the word <span class= "ital">shethum </span>is adopted. Balaam appears to have been thrown into an ecstatic state, as was Saul, and as were many of the ancient prophets; and whilst the eye of the outer senses was closed, the eye of the inner senses was preternaturally opened.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 Now Balaam spake not his own sense, but the language of the Spirit that came upon him. Many have their eyes open who have not their hearts open; are enlightened, but not sanctified. That knowledge which puffs men up with pride, will but serve to light them to hell, whither many go with their eyes open. The blessing is nearly the same as those given before. He admires in Israel, their beauty. The righteous, doubtless, is more excellent than his neighbour. Their fruitfulness and increase. Their honour and advancement. Their power and victory. He looks back upon what had been done for them. Their power and victory. He looks back upon what had been done for them. Their courage and security. The righteous are bold as a lion, not when assaulting others, but when at rest, because God maketh them to dwell in safety. Their influence upon their neighbours. God takes what is done to them, whether good or evil, as done to himself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whose eyes are open - i. e., opened in inward vision, to discern things that were hidden from ordinary beholders. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. the man whose eyes are open&#8212;that is, a seer (1Sa 9:9), a prophet, to whom the visioned future was disclosed&#8212;sometimes when falling into a sleep (Ge 15:12-15), frequently into "a trance."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The eyes, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

He implies that before he was blind and stupid, having eyes, but not seeing nor understanding. Some render the words <span class="ital">having his eyes shut</span>, as the Hebrew verb <span class="ital">satham</span> signifies, the letters <span class="ital">schin</span> and <span class="ital">samech</span> being frequently exchanged; and so the meaning is, that he received this revelation either in a dream, when men’s eyes are simply shut; or in an ecstasy or trance, when men’s eyes, though open, are in a manner shut, to wit, as to the use and exercise of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he took up his parable,.... His parable of prophecy, as the Targums, his prophetic speech, which, with a loud voice, he expressed in the hearing of Balak and his nobles: <p>and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said; the preface to his prophecy is pompous, and seems to be full of pride and vanity, and so the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem represent him;"the man who is more excellent than his father hath said, to whom hidden secrets, even what was hidden from the prophets is revealed to him;''and the Jews have a saying (t) that he that has an evil eye, a haughty spirit, and a large soul, or is covetous, is one of the disciples of Balaam the wicked: <p>and the man whose eyes are open hath said; or, as some (u) render it, whose eyes were shut, but now open; either the eyes of his body, which were shut when the angel met him, and the ass saw him and not he, but afterwards were open, and he saw him also; or the eyes of his understanding blinded with ambition and covetousness, but were open to see his mistake, at least so far as to be sensible that he could never prevail upon God to allow him to curse Israel; or rather open, by the spirit of prophecy coming on him, whereby he saw and foretold things to come. <p>(t) Pirke Abot, c. 5. sect. 19.

The text appears to be corrupt. The word rendered ‘closed’ is very doubtful; and ‘opened’ (R.V. marg.) is no less questionable.

The authorities are divided between the rendering in the text and the opposite rendering given in the margin. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-8.htm">Lamentations 3:8</a>, in the sense of "shut;" but, on the other hand, a passage in the Mishnah distinctly uses <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> in opposite senses. The Vulgate, on the one hand, has <span class="accented">obturatus</span>; the Septuagint, on the other, has <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and this is the sense given by the Targums. Strange to say, it makes no real difference whether we read "open" or "shut," because in any case it was the inward vision that was quickened, while the outward senses were closed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Balaam's Last Words. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-25.htm">Numbers 23:25-30</a>. Balak was not deterred, however, from making another attempt. At first, indeed, he exclaimed in indignation at these second sayings of Balaam: "Thou shalt neither curse it, nor even bless." The double &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; with &#1500;&#1488; signifies "neither - nor;" and the rendering, "if thou do not curse it, thou shalt not bless it," must be rejected as untenable. In his vexation at the second failure, he did not want to hear anything more from Balaam. But when he replied again, that he had told him at the very outset that he could do nothing but what God should say to him (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-38.htm">Numbers 22:38</a>), he altered his mind, and resolved to conduct Balaam to another place with this hope: "peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence." Clericus observes upon this passage, "It was the opinion of the heathen, that what was not obtained through the first, second, or third victim, might nevertheless be secured through a fourth;" and he adduces proofs from Suetonius, Curtius, Gellius, and others. </body></html>
