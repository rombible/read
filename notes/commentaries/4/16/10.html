As the other Levites who belonged to Korah’s company sought the priesthood, so Korah may have aimed at the high priesthood.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-11 Pride and ambition occasion a great deal of mischief both in churches and states. The rebels quarrel with the settlement of the priesthood upon Aaron and his family. Small reason they had to boast of the people's purity, or of God's favour, as the people had been so often and so lately polluted with sin, and were now under the marks of God's displeasure. They unjustly charge Moses and Aaron with taking honour to themselves; whereas they were called of God to it. See here, 1. What spirit levellers are of; those who resist the powers God has set over them. 2. What usage they have been serviceable. Moses sought instruction from God. The heart of the wise studies to answer, and asks counsel of God. Moses shows their privileges as Levites, and convicts them of the sin of undervaluing these privileges. It will help to keep us from envying those above us, duly to consider how many there are below us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Seemeth" is not in the original.

Take your censers, Korah, and all his company, &c.&#8212;that is, since you aspire to the priesthood, then go, perform the highest function of the office&#8212;that of offering incense; and if you are accepted well. How magnanimous the conduct of Moses, who was now as willing that God's people should be priests, as formerly that they should be prophets (Nu 11:29). But he warned them that they were making a perilous experiment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There being at this time but very few priests, and the profits and privileges belonging to them being many and great, they thought it but fit and reasonable that they, or some of the chief of them, should be admitted to share in their work and advantages. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he hath brought thee near to him,....

Korah is there personally addressed: <p>and all thy brethren, the sons of Levi, with thee; the whole tribe of them, excepting Aaron and his family, who were advanced to be priests: <p>and seek ye the priesthood also? the high priesthood, as the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan; this opens the true cause of their discontent and rebellion; they could not be satisfied with being the ministers of the priests, but wanted to be priests themselves, and Korah perhaps to be high priest. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he hath brought thee near <i>to <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> him</i>, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?</span><p>(e) To serve in the congregation, as in the verse before. </div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Moses heard these words of the rebels, he fell upon his face, to complain of the matter to the Lord, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-5.htm">Numbers 14:5</a>. He then said to Korah and his company, "To-morrow Jehovah will show who is His and holy, and will let him come near to Him, and he whom He chooseth will draw near to Him."
