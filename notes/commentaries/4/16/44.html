They called the rebels the people of the Lord; and find fault with Divine justice. The obstinacy of Israel notwithstanding the terrors of God's law, as given on mount Sinai, and the terrors of his judgments, shows how necessary the grace of God is to change men's hearts and lives. Love will do what fear cannot. Moses and Aaron interceded with God for mercy, knowing how great the provocation was. Aaron went, and burned incense between the living and the dead, not to purify the air, but to pacify an offended God. As one tender of the life of every Israelite, Aaron made all possible speed. We must render good for evil. Observe especially, that Aaron was a type of Christ. There is an infection of sin in the world, which only the cross and intercession of Jesus Christ can stay and remove. He enters the defiled and dying camp. He stands between the dead and the living; between the eternal Judge and the souls under condemnation. We must have redemption through His blood, even the remission of sins. We admire the ready devotion of Aaron: shall we not bless and praise the unspeakable grace and love which filled the Saviour's heart, when he placed himself in our stead, and bought us with his life? Greatly indeed hath God commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, Ro 5:8.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These sinners against their own souls - That is, "against their own lives."

After the destruction of the sinners, the Lord commanded that Eleazar should take up the censers "from between the burning," i.e., from the midst of the men that had been burned, and scatter the fire (the burning coals in the pans) far away, that it might not be used any more. "For they (the censers) are holy;" that is to say, they had become holy through being brought before Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-39.htm">Numbers 16:39</a>); and therefore, when the men who brought them were slain, they fell as banned articles to the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>). "The censers of these sinners against their souls" (i.e., the men who have forfeited their lives through their sin: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-10.htm">Habakkuk 2:10</a>), "let them make into broad plates for a covering to the altar" (of burnt-offering). Through this application of them they became a sign, or, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-39.htm">Numbers 16:39</a>, a memorial to all who drew near to the sanctuary, which was to remind them continually of this judgment of God, and warn the congregation of grasping at the priestly prerogatives.
