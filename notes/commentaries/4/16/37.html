God is jealous of the honour of his own institutions, and will not have them invaded. The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord. The censers are devoted, and, as all devoted things, must be made serviceable to the glory of God. This covering of the altar would remind the children of Israel of this event, that others might hear and fear, and do no more presumptuously. They brought destruction on themselves both in body and soul. Thus all who break the law and neglect the gospel choose and love death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Aaron as High Priest and as one of those that offered incense <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-17.htm">Numbers 16:17</a>, could not be defiled by going among the dead.<p>The censers were not to be used again for censers, nor the coals on them for kindling the incense to be offered before the Lord.

His eldest son, that was to succeed him as high priest, and who perhaps was upon the spot to see the issue of things; and who, rather than Aaron, is bid to do what follows, partly because Aaron was now officiating, burning incense, and that he might not be defiled with the dead bodies; and partly because it was more proper and decent for the son to do it than the father; and it may be also because it was for the further confirmation of the priesthood in the posterity of Aaron: <p>that he take up the censers out of the burning; either out from among the dead bodies burnt with fire from the Lord, or out of the burning of the incense in them; these were the censers of Korah and the two hundred fifty men with him: <p>and scatter thou the fire yonder; the fire that was in the censers; the incense burning in them was to be cast out and scattered here and there, or carried to some unclean place at a distance, as a token of the rejection of the services of these men: and thus the Lord answered the prayer of Moses, that he would not have respect to their offering, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-15.htm">Numbers 16:15</a>; if incense is intended there; though that seems to refer only to Dathan and Abiram, and not to these two hundred fifty men: <p>for they are hallowed, incense being offered in them before the Lord, and therefore were not to be made use of in common service. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">37</span>. <span class="ital">out of the burning</span>] From the heap of burnt corpses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for they are holy</span>] These words probably belong to the next verse (see n. there).
