The rebels quarrel with the settlement of the priesthood upon Aaron and his family. Small reason they had to boast of the people's purity, or of God's favour, as the people had been so often and so lately polluted with sin, and were now under the marks of God's displeasure. They unjustly charge Moses and Aaron with taking honour to themselves; whereas they were called of God to it. See here, 1. What spirit levellers are of; those who resist the powers God has set over them. 2. What usage they have been serviceable. Moses sought instruction from God. The heart of the wise studies to answer, and asks counsel of God. Moses shows their privileges as Levites, and convicts them of the sin of undervaluing these privileges. It will help to keep us from envying those above us, duly to consider how many there are below us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the congregation are holy - Compare the marginal reference. Korah's object was not to abolish the distinction between the Levites and the people, but to win priestly dignity for himself and his kinsmen <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-10.htm">Numbers 16:10</a>. This ultimate design is masked for the present in order to win support from the Reubenites by putting forward claims to spiritual equality on behalf of every Israelite. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6, 7.

How magnanimous the conduct of Moses, who was now as willing that God's people should be priests, as formerly that they should be prophets (Nu 11:29).

Perhaps he would say that if he and Aaron were usurpers, the whole tribe of Levi were usurpers too. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The authors of the rebellion were Korah the Levite, a descendant of the Kohathite Izhar, who was a brother of Amram, an ancestor (not the father) of Aaron and Moses (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a>), and three Reubenites, viz., Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, of the Reubenitish family of Pallu (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26-8.htm">Numbers 26:8-9</a>), and On, the son of Peleth, a Reubenite, not mentioned again. The last of these (On) is not referred to again in the further course of this event, either because he played altogether a subordinate part in the affair, or because he had drawn back before the conspiracy came to a head. The persons named took (&#1497;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495;), i.e., gained over to their plan, or persuaded to join them, 250 distinguished men of the other tribes, and rose up with them against Moses and Aaron. On the construction &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;...&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-2.htm">Numbers 16:2</a>), Gesenius correctly observes in his Thesaurus (p. 760), "There is an anakolouthon rather than an ellipsis, and not merely a copyist's error, in these words, 'and Korah,...and Dathan and Abiram, took and rose up against Moses with 250 men,' for they took 250 men, and rose up with them against Moses," etc. He also points to the analogous construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>. Consequently there is no necessity either to force a meaning upon &#1500;&#1511;&#1495;, which is altogether foreign to it, or to attempt an emendation of the text. "They rose up before Moses:" this does not mean, "they stood up in front of his tent," as Knobel explains it, for the purpose of bringing <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-2.htm">Numbers 16:2</a> into contradiction with <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>, but they created an uproar before his eyes; and with this the expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-3.htm">Numbers 16:3</a>, "and they gathered themselves together against Moses and Aaron," may be very simply and easily combined. The 250 men of the children of Israel who joined the rebels no doubt belonged to the other tribes, as is indirectly implied in the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-3.htm">Numbers 27:3</a>, that Zelophehad the Manassite was not in the company of Korah. These men were "princes of the congregation," i.e., heads of the tribes, or of large divisions of the tribes, "called men of the congregation," i.e., members of the council of the nation which administered the affairs of the congregation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-16.htm">Numbers 1:16</a>), "men of name" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>). The leader was Korah; and the rebels are called in consequence "Korah's company" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-6.htm">Numbers 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-9.htm">Numbers 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-3.htm">Numbers 27:3</a>). He laid claim to the high-priesthood, or at least to an equality with Aaron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-17.htm">Numbers 16:17</a>). Among his associates were the Reubenites, Dathan and Abiram, who, no doubt, were unable to get over the fact that the birthright had been taken away from their ancestor, and with it the headship of the house of Israel (i.e., of the whole nation). Apparently their present intention was to seize upon the government of the nation under a self-elected high priest, and to force Moses and Aaron out of the post assigned to them by God, - that is to say, to overthrow the constitution which God had given to His people.</body></html>
