The word, in the singular number, commonly denotes the tabernacle of the congregation—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the boarded erection which was covered by the <span class= "ital">ohel, </span>or tent. The word means simply a “dwelling-place,” and it may denote in this and in the 27th verse a rival tabernacle which had been erected by Korah and the other conspirators; or it may denote, in a collective sense, the tent of Korah, which may have been contumaciously pitched near that of the Reubenites, and also the tents of Dathan and Abiram, which were in proximity to those of the Kohathites, but further removed from the Tabernacle. The substitution of the word “tents” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-26.htm" title="And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins.">Numbers 16:26</a>, in which Moses delivers to the people the command contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-24.htm" title="Speak to the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.">Numbers 16:24</a>, seems to favour the latter of these explanations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/numbers/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/16-24.htm" title="Speak to the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram....">Numbers 16:24-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">Speak unto the congregation — </span>Whom, for your sakes, I will spare upon the condition following. <span class="ital">Unto Dathan — </span>Because they refused to come to him. <span class="ital">The elders — </span>The seventy rulers, whom he carried with him for the greater solemnity of the action, and to encourage them in their work, notwithstanding the obstinate and untractable nature of the people they were to govern.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/numbers/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:23-34 The seventy elders of Israel attend Moses. It is our duty to do what we can to countenance and support lawful authority when it is opposed. And those who would not perish with sinners, must come out from among them, and be separate. It was in answer to the prayer of Moses, that God stirred up the hearts of the congregation to remove for their own safety. Grace to separate from evil-doers is one of the things that accompany salvation. God, in justice, left the rebels to the obstinacy and hardness of their own hearts. Moses, by Divine direction, when all Israel were waiting the event, declares that if the rebels die a common death, he will be content to be called and counted an imposter. As soon as Moses had spoken the word, God caused the earth to open and swallow them all up. The children perished with their parents; in which, though we cannot tell how bad they might be to deserve it, or how good God might be otherwise to them; yet of this we are sure, that Infinite Justice did them no wrong. It was altogether miraculous. God has, when he pleases, strange punishments for the workers of iniquity. It was very significant. Considering how the earth is still in like manner loaded with the weight of man's sins, we have reason to wonder that it does not now sink under its load. The ruin of others should be our warning. Could we, by faith, hear the outcries of those that are gone down to the bottomless pit, we should give more diligence than we do to escape for our lives, lest we also come into their condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tent, "the tabernacle" of Korah, as a Kohathite, stood on the south side of the tabernacle of the Lord; and those of Dathan and Abiram, as Reubenites, in the outer line of encampment on the same side.

It may be, there was a single tabernacle erected on this occasion, for all these men to meet at when they judged it necessary. Aben Ezra is of opinion, Korah had a tent for his men and substance, at a distance from the camp of the Levites, and to his tent joined the tents of Dathan and Abiram. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/numbers/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram</span>] This strange expression, which recurs in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-27.htm" title="So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.">Numbers 16:27</a></span>, has resulted from the combination of the narratives.

The Lord then interposed in judgment. Appearing in His glory to the whole congregation (just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-10.htm">Numbers 14:10</a>), He said to Moses and Aaron, "Separate yourselves from this congregation; I will destroy them in a moment." By assembling in front of the tabernacle, the whole congregation had made common cause with the rebels. God threatened them, therefore, with sudden destruction. But the two men of God, who ere so despised by the rebellious faction, fell on their faces, interceding with God, and praying, "God, Thou God of the spirits of all flesh! this one man (i.e., Korah, the author of the conspiracy) hath sinned, and wilt Thou be wrathful with all the congregation?" i.e., let Thine anger fall upon the whole congregation. The Creator and Preserver of all beings, who has given and still gives life and breath to all flesh, is God of the spirits of all flesh. As the author of the spirit of life in all perishable flesh, God cannot destroy His own creatures in wrath; this would be opposed to His own paternal love and mercy. In this epithet, as applied to God, therefore, Moses appeals "to the universal blessing of creation. It is of little consequence whether these words are to be understood as relating to all the animal kingdom, or to the human race alone; because Moses simply prayed, that as God was the creator and architect of the world, He would not destroy the men whom He had created, but rather have mercy upon the works of His own hands" (Calvin). The intercession of the prophet Isaiah, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>, is similar to this, though that is founded upon the special relation in which God stood to Israel. </body></html>
