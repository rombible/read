The case of a daughter in her father's house. When her vow comes to his knowledge, it is in his power either to confirm it or do it away. The law is plain in the case of a wife. If her husband allows her vow, though only by silence, it stands. If he disallows it, her obligation to her husband takes place of it; for to him she ought to be in subjection, as unto the Lord. The Divine law consults the good order of families. It is fit that every man should bear rule in his own house, and have his wife and children in subjection; rather than that this great rule should be broken, or any encouragement be given to inferior relations to break those bonds asunder, God releases the obligation even of a solemn vow. So much does religion secure the welfare of all societies; and in it the families of the earth have a blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, And if she shall at all be an husband's, and her vows shall be upon her, or a rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul, etc. The "at all" intimates that the case of a girl betrothed but not yet actually married is here especially contemplated. After betrothal, a woman continued to reside, until the period of her marriage arrived, in her father's house; but her property was from that time forward vested in her husband, and she was so far regarded as personally his, that an act of faithlessness to him was, like adultery, punishable with death <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23-24</a>. Hence, his right to control her vows even before he actually took her home as his wife. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. If a woman also vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth&#8212;Girls only are specified; but minors of the other sex, who resided under the parental roof, were included, according to Jewish writers, who also consider the name "father" as comprehending all guardians of youth. We are also told that the age at which young people were deemed capable of vowing was thirteen for boys and twelve for girls. The judgment of a father or guardian on the vow of any under his charge might be given either by an expressed approval or by silence, which was to be construed as approval. But in the case of a husband who, after silence from day to day, should ultimately disapprove or hinder his wife's vow, the sin of non-performance was to be imputed to him and not to her [Nu 30:15].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if her husband disallow her on the day that he heard it,.... Expresses his dislike of it; and this he does as soon as he hears it, at least that same day; according to the Jews (x), within the space of twenty four hours: <p>then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect; by contradicting it, and forbidding the performance of it; or however by declaring to her, or to others, that it is not agreeable to his mind and will that it should be fulfilled: <p>and the Lord shall forgive her; excuse her performance of the vow, and not impute sin to her on that account, nor punish for the breach of it, she being under the cover of her husband, and obliged to submit to his will. According to Jarchi, the Scripture speaks of a woman that vows to be a Nazarite; her husband hears and makes it void; but she does not know it, and transgresses her vow, and drinks wine, and is defiled with the dead, so that she has need of forgiveness, though it is made void; and if vows made void, he adds, have need of pardon, much more those that are not. <p>(x) Leo Modena's History of Rites, &amp;c. par. 2. c. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/numbers/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard <i>it</i>; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.</span><p>(e) For she is in subjection to her husband, and can perform nothing without his consent.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At the head there stands the general rule, "If any one vow a vow to Jehovah, or swear an oath, to bind his soul to abstinence, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that has gone out of his mouth:" i.e., he shall keep or fulfil the vow, and the promise of abstinence, in perfect accordance with his word. &#1504;&#1491;&#1512; is a positive vow, or promise to give or sanctify any part of one's property to the Lord. &#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512;, from &#1488;&#1505;&#1512;, to bind or fetter, the negative vow, or vow of abstinence. &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493; &#1488;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; &#1488;&#1505;&#1512;, to take an abstinence upon his soul. In what such abstinence consisted is not explained, because it was well understood from traditional customs; in all probability it consisted chiefly in fasting and other similar abstinence from lawful things. The Nazarite's vow, which is generally reckoned among the vows of abstinence, is called neder in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2</a>., not issar, because it consisted not merely in abstinence from the fruit of the vine, but also in the positive act of permitting the hair to grow freely in honour of the Lord. The expression "swear an oath" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-13.htm">Numbers 30:13</a>) shows that, as a rule, they bound themselves to abstinence by an oath. The inf. constr., &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1488;, is used here, as in other places, for the inf. abs. (cf. Ges. 131, 4, note 2). &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, from &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;, for &#1497;&#1495;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-7.htm">Ezekiel 39:7</a> (cf.
