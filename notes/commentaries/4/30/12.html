The case of a daughter in her father's house. When her vow comes to his knowledge, it is in his power either to confirm it or do it away. The law is plain in the case of a wife. If her husband allows her vow, though only by silence, it stands. If he disallows it, her obligation to her husband takes place of it; for to him she ought to be in subjection, as unto the Lord. The Divine law consults the good order of families. It is fit that every man should bear rule in his own house, and have his wife and children in subjection; rather than that this great rule should be broken, or any encouragement be given to inferior relations to break those bonds asunder, God releases the obligation even of a solemn vow. So much does religion secure the welfare of all societies; and in it the families of the earth have a blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rather, And if she shall at all be an husband's, and her vows shall be upon her, or a rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul, etc. The "at all" intimates that the case of a girl betrothed but not yet actually married is here especially contemplated. After betrothal, a woman continued to reside, until the period of her marriage arrived, in her father's house; but her property was from that time forward vested in her husband, and she was so far regarded as personally his, that an act of faithlessness to him was, like adultery, punishable with death <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23-24</a>. Hence, his right to control her vows even before he actually took her home as his wife. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. every vow of a widow&#8212;In the case of a married woman, who, in the event of a separation from her husband, or of his death, returned, as was not uncommon, to her father's house, a doubt might have been entertained whether she was not, as before, subject to paternal jurisdiction and obliged to act with the paternal consent. The law ordained that the vow was binding if it had been made in her husband's lifetime, and he, on being made aware of it, had not interposed his veto [Nu 30:10, 11]; as, for instance, she might have vowed, when not a widow, that she would assign a portion of her income to pious and charitable uses, of which she might repent when actually a widow; but by this statute she was required to fulfil the obligation, provided her circumstances enabled her to redeem the pledge. The rules laid down must have been exceedingly useful for the prevention or cancelling of rash vows, as well as for giving a proper sanction to such as were legitimate in their nature, and made in a devout, reflecting spirit.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them,....

The first case (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-3.htm">Numbers 30:3-5</a>) is that of a woman in her youth, while still unmarried, and living in her father's house. If she made a vow of performance or abstinence, and her father heard of it and remained silent, it was to stand, i.e., to remain in force. But if her father held her back when he heard of it, i.e., forbade her fulfilling it, it was not to stand or remain in force, and Jehovah would forgive her because of her father's refusal. Obedience to a father stood higher than a self-imposed religious service. - The second case (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-6.htm">Numbers 30:6-8</a>) was that of a vow of performance or abstinence, made by a woman before her marriage, and brought along with her (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;, "upon herself") into her marriage. In such a case the husband had to decide as to its validity, in the same way as the father before her marriage. In the day when he heard of it he could hold back his wife, i.e., dissolve her vow; but if he did not do this at once, he could not hinder its fulfilment afterwards. &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; &#1502;&#1489;&#1496;&#1488;, gossip of her lips, that which is uttered thoughtlessly or without reflection (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>). This expression implies that vows of abstinence were often made by unmarried women without thought or reflection. - The third case (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-9.htm">Numbers 30:9</a>) was that of a vow made by a widow or divorced woman. Such a vow had full force, because the woman was not dependent upon a husband. - The fourth case (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-10.htm">Numbers 30:10-12</a>) was that of a vow made by a wife in her married state. Such a vow was to remain in force if her husband remained silent when he heard of it, and did not restrain her. On the other hand, it was to have no force if her husband dissolved it at once. After this there follows the general statement (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/30-13.htm">Numbers 30:13-16</a>), that a husband could establish or dissolve every vow of performance or abstinence made by his wife. If, however, he remained silent "from day to day," he confirmed it by his silence; and if afterwards he should declare it void, he was to bear his wife's iniquity. &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, the sin which the wife would have had to bear if she had broken the vow of her own accord. This consisted either in a sin-offering to expiate her sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-4.htm">Leviticus 5:4</a>.); or if this was omitted, in the punishment which God suspended over the sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). </body></html>
