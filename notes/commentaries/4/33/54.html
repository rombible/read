They would foster vipers in their own bosoms. The remnant of the Canaanites, if they made any peace with them, though but for a time, would be pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides. We must expect trouble and affliction from whatever sin we indulge; that which we are willing should tempt us, will vex us. It was intended that the Canaanites should be put out of the land; but if the Israelites learned their wicked ways, they also would be put out. Let us hear this and fear. If we do not drive out sin, sin will drive us out. If we are not the death of our lusts, our lusts will be the death of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The expulsion of the Canaanites and the destruction of their monuments of idolatry had been already enjoined (see the marginal references); and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a> is substantially a repetition from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-53.htm">Exodus 26:53-55</a>.
