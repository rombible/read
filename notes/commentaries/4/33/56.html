They would foster vipers in their own bosoms. The remnant of the Canaanites, if they made any peace with them, though but for a time, would be pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides. We must expect trouble and affliction from whatever sin we indulge; that which we are willing should tempt us, will vex us. It was intended that the Canaanites should be put out of the land; but if the Israelites learned their wicked ways, they also would be put out. Let us hear this and fear. If we do not drive out sin, sin will drive us out. If we are not the death of our lusts, our lusts will be the death of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The expulsion of the Canaanites and the destruction of their monuments of idolatry had been already enjoined (see the marginal references); and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a> is substantially a repetition from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-53.htm">Exodus 26:53-55</a>. But the solemn warning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55-56</a> is new. A call for it had been furnished by their past transgressions in the matter of Baal-peor, and by their imperfect fulfillment, at the first, of Moses' orders in the Midianite war. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>55. But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you&#8212;No associations were to be formed with the inhabitants; otherwise, "if ye let remain, they will be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides"&#8212;that is, they would prove troublesome and dangerous neighbors, enticing to idolatry, and consequently depriving you of the divine favor and blessing. The neglect of the counsel against union with the idolatrous inhabitants became fatal to them. This earnest admonition given to the Israelites in their peculiar circumstances conveys a salutary lesson to us to allow no lurking habits of sin to remain in us. That spiritual enemy must be eradicated from our nature; otherwise it will be ruinous to our present peace and future salvation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover, it shall come to pass,....

The threat (although in fact fulfilled) does not necessarily involve any prophecy, since to settle down among the remnants of the heathen was a course of action which would obviously and for many reasons commend itself to the Israelites. Indolence and cowardice were consulted by such a policy as much as the natural feelings of pity towards vanquished and apparently harmless foes. The command to extirpate was certainly justified in this case (if it could be in any) by the unhappy consequences of its neglect. Israel being what he was, and so little severed in anything but religion from the ancient heathen, his only chance of future happiness lay in keeping himself from any contact with them. On the morality of the command itself, see on the passages referred to, and on the slaughter of the Midianites. As a fact, the extirpation of the conquered did not offend the moral sense of the Jews then any more than it did that of our heathen Saxon ancestors. Where both races could not dwell in security, it was a matter of course that the weaker was destroyed. Such a command was therefore justified at that time by the end to be attained, because it was not contrary to the moral law as then revealed, or to the moral sense as then educated. Being in itself a lawful proceeding, it was made a religious proceeding, and taken out of the category of selfish violence by being made a direct command of God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>These instructions, with which the eyes of the Israelites were directed to the end of all their wandering, viz., the possession of the promised land, are arranged in two sections by longer introductory formulas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-50.htm">Numbers 33:50</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1</a>). The former contains the divine commands (a) with regard to the extermination of the Canaanites and their idolatry, and the division of the land among the tribes of Israel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-50.htm">Numbers 33:50-56</a>); (b) concerning the boundaries of Canaan (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-1.htm">Numbers 34:1-15</a>); (c) concerning the men who were to divide the land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-16.htm">Numbers 34:16-29</a>). The second contains commands (a) respecting the towns to be given up to the Levites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1-8</a>); (b) as to the setting apart of cities of refuge for unintentional manslayers, and the course to be adopted in relation to such manslayers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9-34</a>); and (c) a law concerning the marrying of heiresses within their own tribes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-1.htm">Numbers 36:1-13</a>). - The careful dovetailing of all these legal regulations by separate introductory formulas, is a distinct proof that the section <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-50.htm">Numbers 33:50-56</a> is not to be regarded, as Baumgarten, Knobel, and others suppose, in accordance with the traditional division of the chapters, as an appendix or admonitory conclusion to the list of stations, but as the general legal foundation for the more minute instructions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34-36</a>.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-50.htm">Numbers 33:50-56</a><p>Command to Exterminate the Canaanites, and Divide their Land among the Families of Israel.</body></html>
