It is a memorable history. In their travels towards Canaan they were continually on the remove. Such is our state in this world; we have here no continuing city, and all our removes in this world are but from one part a desert to another. They were led to and fro, forward and backward, yet were all the while under the direction of the pillar of cloud and fire. God led them about, yet led them the right way. The way God takes in bringing his people to himself is always the best way, though it does not always seem to us the nearest way. Former events are mentioned. Thus we ought to keep in mind the providences of God concerning us and families, us and our land, and the many instances of that Divine care which has led us, and fed us, and kept us all our days hitherto. Few periods of our lives can be thought upon, without reminding us of the Lord's goodness, and our own ingratitude and disobedience: his kindness leaves us without excuse for our sins. We could not wish to travel over again the stages we have passed, unless we could hope, by the grace of God, to shun the sins we then committed, and to embrace such opportunities of doing good as we have let slip. Soon will our wanderings end, and our eternal state be fixed beyond recall; how important then is the present moment! Happy are those whom the Lord now guides with his counsel, and will at length receive to his glory. To this happiness the gospel calls us. Behold now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation. Let sinners seize the opportunity, and flee for refuge to the hope set before them. Let us redeem our time, to glorify God and serve our generation; and he will carry us safely through all, to his eternal kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Pi-hahiroth - Hebrew "Hahiroth," but perhaps only by an error of transcription.

We do not, however, know what physical changes have taken place since that time, and it is quite possible that at Etham there may have been a ford, or some other easy means of communication, so that the strip of desert along the opposite shore came to be known as the wilderness of Etham. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The first and second verses form the heading: "These are the marches of the children of Israel, which they marched out," i.e., the marches which they made from one place to another, on going out of Egypt. &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1506; does not mean a station, but the breaking up of a camp, and then a train, or march (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-3.htm">Genesis 13:3</a>). &#1500;&#1510;&#1489;&#1488;&#1514;&#1501; (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-4.htm">Exodus 7:4</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, under the guidance, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/4-28.htm">Numbers 4:28</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-21.htm">Exodus 38:21</a>. &#1500;&#1502;&#1505;&#1506;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, "their goings out (properly, their places of departure) according to their marches," is really equivalent to the clause which follows: "their marches according to their places of departure." The march of the people is not described by the stations, or places of encampment, but by the particular spots from which they set out. Hence the constant repetition of the word &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1505;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, "and they broke up."
