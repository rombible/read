Joshua intimates the same to them before he died, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-13.htm" title="And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from from where you may see them: you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there.">Numbers 23:13</a>.

Whosoever, by neglecting, through the Spirit, (to be sought by prayer,) to mortify the deeds of the body, and to crucify the flesh, with its sinful lusts, shall permit sinful tempers and desires to remain in his heart, will one day find by experience that these evil dispositions will be to his soul what the ancient inhabitants of Canaan were to the Israelites; they will be as <span class="ital">pricks in his eyes, and thorns in his flesh — </span>A continual source of trouble and vexation, depriving him of true peace and comfort. But is it our privilege to be delivered from these corrupt passions and inclinations? Certainly it is, as much as it was the privilege of the Israelites to be delivered from the Canaanites. <span class="ital">For Christ gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>,) <span class="ital">might sanctify and cleanse his church, and render it without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-26.htm" title="That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,...">Ephesians 5:26-27</a>.

They would foster vipers in their own bosoms. The remnant of the Canaanites, if they made any peace with them, though but for a time, would be pricks in their eyes, and thorns in their sides. We must expect trouble and affliction from whatever sin we indulge; that which we are willing should tempt us, will vex us. It was intended that the Canaanites should be put out of the land; but if the Israelites learned their wicked ways, they also would be put out. Let us hear this and fear. If we do not drive out sin, sin will drive us out. If we are not the death of our lusts, our lusts will be the death of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/numbers/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The expulsion of the Canaanites and the destruction of their monuments of idolatry had been already enjoined (see the marginal references); and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a> is substantially a repetition from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/26-53.htm">Exodus 26:53-55</a>. But the solemn warning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55-56</a> is new. A call for it had been furnished by their past transgressions in the matter of Baal-peor, and by their imperfect fulfillment, at the first, of Moses' orders in the Midianite war. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/numbers/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>55. But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you&#8212;No associations were to be formed with the inhabitants; otherwise, "if ye let remain, they will be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides"&#8212;that is, they would prove troublesome and dangerous neighbors, enticing to idolatry, and consequently depriving you of the divine favor and blessing. The neglect of the counsel against union with the idolatrous inhabitants became fatal to them. This earnest admonition given to the Israelites in their peculiar circumstances conveys a salutary lesson to us to allow no lurking habits of sin to remain in us. That spiritual enemy must be eradicated from our nature; otherwise it will be ruinous to our present peace and future salvation.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/numbers/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Pricks in your eyes, </span> i.e. both vexatious and pernicious, for the eye is a tender part, and a wound there is very mischievous. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/numbers/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land before you,....
