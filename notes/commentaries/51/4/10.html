When, after two years’ captivity, the Apostle starts from Cæsarea on his voyage to Rome, Aristarchus is again named by St. Luke as “being with us” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-2.htm" title="And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.">Acts 27:2</a>). From this fact, and from his being called here “my fellow-prisoner” (a name which there seems no adequate reason to consider as metaphorical), it would appear that, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, Aristarchus really shared his captivity. It is certainly not a little curious that in the Epistle to Philemon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philemon/1-23.htm" title="There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;">Philemon 1:23-24</a>), sent at the same time, it is Epaphras who is called the fellow-prisoner,” while Aristarchus is simply classed among the fellow-labourers.” This variation is interesting to us as one of the characteristic marks of independence and genuineness in the Epistles; but it can only be accounted for by mere conjecture, such as that of their alternately sharing the Apostle’s captivity.<p><span class= "bld">Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas.</span>—The notices of John Mark in the New Testament are full of interest. This is the first notice of him since the day when St. Paul rejected him from his function of “ministration,” because on the former journey he had “deserted” them at Perga, and had “not gone with them to the work” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a>). Then he had gone with Barnabas to Cyprus, to take part in an easier work, nearer home and under the kindly guardianship of his uncle. Now the formal charge to the Colossian Church to “receive him”—a kind of “letter of commendation” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>)—evidently shows that they had known of him as under St. Paul’s displeasure, and were now to learn that he had seen reason to restore him to his confidence. In the Epistle to Philemon Mark is named, as of course (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>), among his “fellow-labourers.” In St. Paul’s last Epistle, written almost with a dying hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2Timothy 4:11</a>), there is a touch of peculiar pathos in the charge which he, left alone in prison with his old companion St. Luke, gives to Timothy to bring Mark, as now being right serviceable for the “ministration” from which he had once rejected him. Evidently St. Paul’s old rebuke had done its work, and, if Mark did join him in his last hours, he probably thanked him for nothing so much as for the loving sternness of days gone by. Before this, if (as seems likely) he is the “Marcus, my son” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>, he was with St. Peter, and must be identified with St. Mark the Evangelist, subsequently, as tradition has it, bishop and martyr at Alexandria.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/colossians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)...">Colossians 4:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner — </span>Such was Epaphras likewise for a time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-23.htm" title="There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;">Philemon 1:23</a>; <span class="ital">saluteth you </span>— “This excellent person was a Jew, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision.

Aristarchus, therefore, was a person of great note, and highly respected by the church of the Thessalonians, of which he was a member. And his whole conduct showed that he merited the good opinion they entertained of him. For when Paul was imprisoned in Judea, that good man abode with him, and ministered to him all the time of his imprisonment, both at Jerusalem and Cesarea, attended him at his trials, and comforted him with his company and conversation. And when it was determined to send Paul into Italy, he went along with him, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-2.htm" title="And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.">Acts 27:2</a>,) and remained with him during his confinement there, and zealously assisted him in preaching the gospel, as the apostle informs us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision.

That <span class="ital">all </span>our fellow- workers should be a comfort to us? The apostle, therefore, having in this passage mentioned the names of all the Jews who sincerely preached Christ in Rome at that time, it is certain Peter was not there then; otherwise his name would have been in the list of those labourers who had been a consolation to St. Paul. For we cannot suppose that Peter was one of those, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-14.htm" title="And many of the brothers in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear....">Php 1:14-15</a>, who preached the gospel from strife, to add affliction to Paul’s bonds.

If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner - Aristarchus was of Thessalonica, and is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>, as Paul's companion in his travels. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>, it is said that he accompanied him in his voyage to Rome, and from the passage before us it appears that he was there imprisoned with him. As he held the same sentiments as Paul, and was united with him in his travels and labors, it was natural that he should be treated in the same manner. He, together with Gaius, had been seized in the tumult at Ephesus and treated with violence, but he adhered to the apostle in all his troubles, and attended him all his perils. Nothing further is certainly known of him, though "the Greeks say that he was bishop of Assamea in Syria, and was beheaded with Paul at Rome, under Nero" - Calmet.<p>And Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas - John Mark, in relation to whom Paul and Barnabas had formerly disagreed so much as to cause a separation between Barnabas and Paul. The ground of the disagreement was, that Barnabas wished to take him, probably on account of relationship, with them in their travels; Paul was unwilling to take him, because he had, on one occasion, departed from them; Notes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-39</a>. They afterward became reconciled, and Paul mentions Mark here with affection. He sent for him when he sent Tychicus to Ephesus, and it seems that he had come to him in obedience to his request; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>. Mark had probably become more decided, and Paul did not harbor unkind and unforgiving feelings toward anyone.<p>Touching whom ye received commandments - What these directions were, and how they were communicated, whether verbally or by writing, is now unknown. It was, not improbably, on some occasion when Paul was with them. He refers to it here in order that they might know distinctly whom he meant.<p>If he come to you, receive him - In Plm 1:24, Mark is mentioned as a" fellow-laborer" of Paul. It would seem probable, therefore, that he was not a prisoner. Paul here intimates that he was about to leave Rome, and he enjoins it on the Colossians to receive him kindly. This injunction may have been necessary, as the Colossians may have been aware of the breach between him and Paul, and may have been disposed to regard him with suspicion. Paul retained no malice, and now commended, in the warmest manner, one from whom he was formerly constrained to separate. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Aristarchus&#8212;a Macedonian of Thessalonica (Ac 27:2), who was dragged into the theater at Ephesus, during the tumult with Gaius, they being "Paul's companions in travel." He accompanied Paul to Asia (Ac 20:4), and subsequently (Ac 27:2) to Rome. He was now at Rome with Paul (compare Phm 23, 24). As he is here spoken of as Paul's "fellow prisoner," but in Phm 24 as Paul's "fellow laborer"; and vice versa, Epaphras in Phm 23, as his "fellow prisoner," but here (Col 1:7) "fellow servant," Meyer in Alford, conjectures that Paul's friends voluntarily shared his imprisonment by turns, Aristarchus being his fellow prisoner when he wrote to the Colossians, Epaphras when he wrote to Philemon. The Greek for "fellow prisoner" is literally, fellow captive, an image from prisoners taken in warfare, Christians being "fellow soldiers" (Php 2:25; Phm 2), whose warfare is "the good fight of faith."<p>Mark&#8212;John Mark (Ac 12:12, 25); the Evangelist according to tradition.<p>sister's son&#8212;rather, "cousin," or "kinsman to Barnabas"; the latter being the better known is introduced to designate Mark. The relationship naturally accounts for Barnabas' selection of Mark as his companion when otherwise qualified; and also for Mark's mother's house at Jerusalem being the place of resort of Christians there (Ac 12:12). The family belonged to Cyprus (Ac 4:36); this accounts for Barnabas' choice of Cyprus as the first station on their journey (Ac 13:4), and for Mark's accompanying them readily so far, it being the country of his family; and for Paul's rejecting him at the second journey for not having gone further than Perga, in Pamphylia, but having gone thence home to his mother at Jerusalem (Mt 10:37) on the first journey (Ac 13:13).<p>touching whom&#8212;namely, Mark.<p>ye received commandments&#8212;possibly before the writing of this Epistle; or the "commandments" were verbal by Tychicus, and accompanying this letter, since the past tense was used by the ancients (where we use the present) in relation to the time which it would be when the letter was read by the Colossians. Thus (Phm 19), "I have written," for "I write." The substance of them was, "If he come unto you, receive him." Paul's rejection of him on his second missionary journey, because he had turned back at Perga on the first journey (Ac 13:13; 15:37-39), had caused an alienation between himself and Barnabas. Christian love soon healed the breach; for here he implies his restored confidence in Mark, makes honorable allusion to Barnabas, and desires that those at Colosse who had regarded Mark in consequence of that past error with suspicion, should now "receive" him with kindness. Colosse is only about one hundred ten miles from Perga, and less than twenty from the confines of Pisidia, through which province Paul and Barnabas preached on their return during the same journey. Hence, though Paul had not personally visited the Colossian Church, they knew of the past unfaithfulness of Mark; and needed this recommendation of him, after the temporary cloud on him, so as to receive him, now that he was about to visit them as an evangelist. Again, in Paul's last imprisonment, he, for the last time, speaks of Mark (2Ti 4:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Aristarchus my fellow prisoner saluteth you:</span> here he doth wish prosperity to them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-5.htm" title="And into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this house.">Luke 10:5</a></span>, in the name of others, beginning with those of the circumcision, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, </span> who had been his fellow traveller, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm" title="And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.">Acts 19:29</a> 20:4 27:2</span>; yea, and now his fellow prisoner, and fellow labourer, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas; </span> and John Mark, who was nephew to Barnabas, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a> 13:13</span>; and having sometime displeased Paul by his departure and accompanying his uncle Barnabas, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-37.htm" title="And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 15:37</a>,39</span>, yet afterwards repented, and was reconciled to Paul, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me.

Hence various interpreters have taken it to refer not to a <span class="ital">proper, enforced</span> sharing of the captivity, but to a <span class="ital">voluntary</span> one, it being assumed, namely, that friends of the apostle allowed themselves to be temporarily shut up with him in prison, in order to be with him and to minister to him not merely as visitors, but continuously day and night. Comp. Huther, de Wette, and Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom</span>. I. p. xxi. According to this view, such friends <span class="ital">changed places</span> from time to time, so that, when the apostle wrote <span class="ital">our</span> letter, <span class="ital">Aristarchus</span>, and when he wrote that to Philemon, <span class="ital">Epaphras</span>, shared his captivity. But such a relation could the less be gathered by the readers from the mere <span class="greekheb">συναιχμάλωτος</span> (comp.

Ewald conjectures that they were given in the letter to the Laodiceans, and related to love-offerings for Jerusalem, which Mark was finally to fetch and attend to. But the work of collection was probably closed with the last journey of the apostle to Jerusalem. Others hold, contrary to the notion of <span class="greekheb">ἐντολή</span>, that <span class="ital">letters of recommendation</span> are meant from <span class="ital">Barnabas</span> (Grotius), or from <span class="ital">the Roman church</span> (Estius); while others think that the following <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν ἔλθῃ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λ</span>. forms the contents of <span class="greekheb">ἐντολάς</span> (Calvin—who, with Syriac, Ambrosiaster, and some codd., reads subsequently <span class="greekheb">δέξασθαι</span>,—comp.

From the circumstance, however, that <span class="greekheb">δέξασθε</span> stands without special modal definition, it is not to be inferred that Paul was apprehensive lest the readers should not, without this summons, have recognised Mark (on account of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a> f.) as an apostolic associate (Wieseler, <span class="ital">Chronol. des apost.

He was a Thessalonian; he accompanied St Paul on his third journey, and was, with Gaius, seized at Ephesus, when the riot broke out. (Just possibly, the word <span class="ital">fellow-captive</span> may be a free allusion to that terrible hour.) He was with St Paul later when he returned from Greece to Asia, and either accompanied or followed him on to Syria, for he sails with him from Syria for Rome.

We gather from these mentions that Marcus was also called Johannes; the latter, probably, as his Hebrew home-name, the former as his alternative name for Gentile intercourse. So Saul was Paul, and Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-11.htm" title=" And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow workers to the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort to me.">Colossians 4:11</a>) was Justus; and so it is often now with Jews in Europe. (It is noticeable that the Jewish name drops away as the narrative proceeds; “<span class="ital">John Mark</span>,” or “<span class="ital">John</span>,” is only “<span class="ital">Mark</span>” in Acts 15 and in the Epistles.) His father is not mentioned; his mother was a Mary (Miriam), who lived at Jerusalem, whose house was a rendezvous of the disciples a.d. 44, to which Peter, released from prison, went as to a familiar place. He was cousin (see next note) to Barnabas. Peter calls him “<span class="ital">my son</span>”; spiritually, of course, assuming the identity of person in all the mentions of Marcus. Perhaps Peter, in the house of Mary, met her son and drew him to the Lord, thus “begetting him again.” With Paul and Barnabas, as their “helper,” he set out on their mission-journey (a.d. 45), but left them at Perga for Jerusalem, for a reason not known, but not approved of by Paul. Some seven years later he accompanied Barnabas on a second mission to Cyprus, after the “sharp contention” of the two Apostles. But that difference was not permanent (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>); and now, nine or ten years later again, we find him with St Paul at Rome, and perhaps about to return (see this verse), with his blessing, to Asia. Later again, probably (but see Appendix B), he is with his spiritual father, Peter, at Babylon (probably the literal Chaldean Babylon, not the mystical, Rome). And then, again later, probably, he is with or near Timothy in Asia; and Paul, a second time imprisoned, sends for him, as “useful for him for personal service.” Here end our certain notices. In Scripture, he <span class="ital">may</span> be the “certain young man” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/14-51.htm" title="And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold on him:...">Mark 14:51-52</a>. Tradition, from early cent. 2 onwards, makes him the writer of the Second Gospel, and to have compiled it as in some sense Peter’s exponent. (Cp. Eusebius, <span class="ital">History</span>, 111. 39; and see Salmon, <span class="ital">Introd. to N. T</span>. p. 110, etc.) Later tradition (first recorded cent. 4) makes him founder and first bishop of the Alexandrian church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sister’s son</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">cousin</span>. Latin versions, <span class="ital">consobrinus;</span> Wyclif, “<span class="ital">cosyn</span>.” The Greek, <span class="ital">anepsios</span>, bears the meaning “<span class="ital">sister’s son</span>” in later Greek, but its derivation and earlier usage fix it here to mean a cousin-german, the child of the other’s own aunt or uncle.—Etymologically, it is remotely akin to our “<span class="ital">nephew</span>”; but that word also has varied its reference. In the A.V. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a> it means “<span class="ital">descendants</span>,” such as grandchildren; representing a different Greek word.—This kinship explains no doubt, in part, the wish of the loving Barnabas to retain Marcus as his helper (Acts 15).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye received commandments</span>] No doubt through some previous emissary from Rome to Asia.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">if he come</span>] An intended visit of Marcus to Asia is implied.

"Fellow prisoner" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">captive, prisoner of war</span>) differs from the "prisoner" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">one in bonds</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-8.htm">2 Timothy 1:8</a>. The supposition that these men were permitted as friends to share St. Paul's captivity in turn, is conjectural (see Meyer). Possibly the incident recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a> was attended by some temporary joint imprisonment of St. Paul and Aristarchus. As "a soldier of Christ Jesus," the apostle was himself now "a prisoner of war" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-3.htm">2 Corinthians 10:3-6</a>); and therefore those who shared his sufferings were his "fellow prisoners," as they were his" fellow soldiers" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-2.htm">Philemon 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-30.htm">Philippians 1:30</a>) and his "fellow servants" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, about whom you received commandments - if he should come to you, welcome him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>). It is pleasant to find John Mark, who deserted the apostle in his first missionary journey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>), and on whose account he separated from Barnabas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37-40</a>) ten years before, now taken again into his confidence and friendship (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). And indeed it is evident that there was no permanent estrangement between the two great Gentile missionaries; for Mark is called "cousin of Barnabas" by way of recommendation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1, 9, 13</a>). Mary, the mother of John Mark, was a person of some consideration in the Church at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>), and through her he may have been related to Barnabas, who, though a Cypriot Jew, had property near Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36, 37</a>), and was also highly honoured by the mother Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-22.htm">Acts 11:22-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-25.htm">Acts 15:25, 26</a>). Mark is, moreover, a link between the Apostles Paul and Peter. It is to the house of his mother that the latter betakes himself on his escape from Herod's prison (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a> he appears, along with Silvanus (Silos), St. Paul's old comrade, in St. Peter's company, who calls him "my son." St. Peter was then at Babylon, where Mark may have arrived at the end of the journey eastwards which St. Paul here contemplates his undertaking. The striking correspondence of language and thought between St. Peter's First Epistle (addressed, moreover, to Churches of Asia Minor) and those of St. Paul to the Ephesians and Colossians (and, in an equal degree, that to the Romans) suggests the existence of some special connection at this time between the two writers, such as may well have been afforded by Mark, if, leaving Rome soon after the despatch of these letters, he travelled in their track by way of Asia Minor to join St. Peter at Babylon. At the time of St. Paul's second imprisonment, about four years later, Mark is again in Asia Minor in the neighbourhood of Timothy, and the apostle desires his services at Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>). When or how the Colossians had received already directions concerning Mark, we have no means of knowing. His journey appears to have been postponed. The apostle must before this have communicated with the Colossians. The visit of Epaphras to Rome may have been due to some communication from him. "If he should come to you, give him a welcome," is the request the apostle now makes. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner<p>See on Plm 1:23, Plm 1:24. Unnecessary difficulty is made over the fact that the term fellow-prisoner is applied to Epaphras in Plm 1:23, and not to Aristarchus; while here the case is reversed. It is not necessary to suppose that the two had changed places, or that the captivity was voluntary, if a literal captivity was meant. All the three terms fellow-prisoner, fellow-servant, fellow-worker - might be applied to both; and, as Dwight remarks, "Reasons unknown to us may easily have determined the use of one word or the other, independently of the question as to the particular time when they were in imprisonment."<p>Mark<p>See on Plm 1:24.<p>Sister's son (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;)<p>Only here in the New Testament. Rev., correctly, cousin. The sense of nephew did not attach to the word until very late. Lightfoot remains that this incidental notice explains why Barnabas should have taken a more favorable view of Mark's defection than Paul, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-37.htm">Acts 15:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-39.htm">Acts 15:39</a>. </body></html>
