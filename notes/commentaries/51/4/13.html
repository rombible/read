In such responsibility, as in the charges of Timothy and Titus, we see the link between the apostolate of this period and the episcopacy of the future.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:10-18 Paul had differed with Barnabas, on the account of this Mark, yet he is not only reconciled, but recommends him to the churches; an example of a truly Christian and forgiving spirit. If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I bear him record - Paul had had abundant opportunity to know what were his feelings in regard to these churches.<p>A great zeal for you - A great desire to promote your welfare.<p>And them that are in Laodicea - Laodicea was the capital of Phrygia, and not far from Colossae, There was a church there.

It was situated under a hill to the north, and had on the south a large plain about five miles over. On the south of that plain, and opposite to Hierapolis, was Laodicea, with the river Lycus running between them, nearer to Laodicea than to Hierapolls. This place is now called by the Turks Pambuck-Kulasi, or the Cotton-Tower, on account of the white cliffs which lie round about it. It is now utterly forsaken and desolate, but the ruins are so magnificent as to show that it was once one of the most splendid cities in the East. It was celebrated for the hot springs in its vicinity; and on account of the numerous temples erected there, it received the name of Hierapolis, or the holy city. The principal deity worshipped there was Apollo. See Travels by T. Smith. B. D. 1678. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-16.htm">Colossians 4:16</a>. From the allusion to it here, it would seem that there were Christians there in the time of Paul, though there is no mention of a church there. It is nowhere else mentioned in the New Testament. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. a great zeal&#8212;The oldest manuscripts and Vulgate have "much labor."<p>for you&#8212;lest you should be seduced (Col 2:4); a motive why you should be anxious for yourselves.<p>them that are in Laodicea &#8230; Hierapolis&#8212;churches probably founded by Epaphras, as the Church in Colosse was.

The apostle takes no notice to the Colossians of Epaphras being his fellow prisoner, as, he does in his epistle to Plm 1:23 it may be for this reason, lest they should be over much distressed and cast down with it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-13.htm" title=" For I bear him record, that he has a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.">Colossians 4:13</a>. <span class="ital">General</span> testimony in <span class="ital">confirmation</span> of the <span class="ital">particular</span> statement made regarding Epaphras in <span class="greekheb">πάντοτε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; on which account there is the less reason to ascribe to the interpolator the more precise definition of <span class="greekheb">ἀγωνιζ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>., which is given by <span class="greekheb">ἐν ταῖς προσευχ</span>.

Laodicaea and Hierapolis faced each other on the north and south sides of the Lycus valley, about six miles apart. Colossae was ten or twelve miles farther up the stream. Hierapolis owed its celebrity to its warm mineral springs, its baths, and its trade in dyed wools. It was a center of the worship of the Phrygian goddess Cybele, whose rites were administered by mutilated priests known as Galli, and of other rites representing different oriental cults. Hence the name Hierapolis or sacred city. </body></html>
