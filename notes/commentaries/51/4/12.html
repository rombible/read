In the two epithets—perfect and fully established in conviction—we may again trace, as before, reference to the pretensions of the Gnostic teachers to exclusive perfection in wisdom.

He was not only an intelligent and sincere disciple of Christ, but the apostle’s affectionate and faithful friend, as appears from his attending him in several of his journeys through the Lesser Asia and Greece.

And when the apostle was sent a prisoner to Italy, Luke accompanied him in the voyage, and remained with him till he was released. He was also with the apostle during his second imprisonment in the same city; on which occasion, when his other assistants deserted him, through fear, Luke abode with him, and ministered to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me.

If men have been guilty of a fault, it must not always be remembered against them. We must forget as well as forgive. The apostle had comfort in the communion of saints and ministers. One is his fellow-servant, another his fellow-prisoner, and all his fellow-workers, working out their own salvation, and endeavouring to promote the salvation of others. The effectual, fervent prayer is the prevailing prayer, and availeth much. The smiles, flatteries, or frowns of the world, the spirit of error, or the working of self-love, leads many to a way of preaching and living which comes far short of fulfilling their ministry. But those who preach the same doctrine as Paul, and follow his example, may expect the Divine favour and blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Epaphras - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a>.<p>Always laboring fervently for you in prayers - Margin, "or striving."

The desire was, that they might maintain their Christian principles unadulterated by the mixture of philosophy and error, and completely perform the will of God in every respect. This is the expression of a pious wish in regard to them, without any affirmation that any had been absolutely perfect, or that they would be perfect in this world. It is, however, a command of God that we should be perfect (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>), and it is the highest wish of benevolence in reference to anyone that he may be complete in moral character, and may do all the will of God; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-9.htm">1 Corinthians 13:9</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The usage of this verb (see Lightfoot’s note) leaves the rendering “<span class="ital">filled</span>” still possible; but the parallels in St Paul are in favour of R.V.—Epaphras prayed, in effect, that their Christian consistency might be <span class="ital">mature</span> (“<span class="ital">perfect</span>”) and <span class="ital">consciously decided</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in all the will</span>] More lit., “<span class="ital">in every will</span>”<span class="ital">;</span> <span class="bld">in every part of the will</span>.

"Bondman of Christ Jesus" is the title the apostle so often claims for himself (see references), only here put by him on any one else. Is there an implied reference to Onesimus (ver. 9), who was "a bondman after the flesh," but "the Lord's freedman" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>), while Epaphras, "the freeman," is "Christ's bondman" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>)?

For Churches threatened by the attacks of heresy it was above all things needful "that they should stand fast." On "perfect," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-28.htm">Colossians 1:28</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-14.htm">Colossians 3:14</a>; the word bears a primary reference to "knowledge," and implies a fully instructed and enlightened condition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-15.htm">Philippians 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm">Hebrews 6:1</a>), attended with corresponding spiritual advancement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>). "Fully assured" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Revised Text) carries us back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a> (see notes; on this verb, compare Lightfoot's exhaustive note). It bears the same sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a> and Romans 14:5; a slightly different one in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1</a>. From the tenor of the letter it appears that the Colossians needed a deeper Christian insight and more intelligent and well-grounded convictions respecting the truth "as in Jesus."

Will means the thing willed, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-30.htm">James 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>. Hence used sometimes in the plural, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>, shall do all my will (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;), i.e., perform all the things willed by me. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>, desires, strictly willings. So here the sense is, everything willed by God. The connection is apparently with &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5; ye may stand. For a similar construction see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>. As Meyer observes, this connection gives stand both a modal definition (perfect and fully assured) and a local definition (in all the will). </body></html>
