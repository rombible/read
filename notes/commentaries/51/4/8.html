They have one Lord, though they have different stations and powers for service. It is a great comfort under the troubles and difficulties of life, to have fellow Christians caring for us. Circumstances of life make no difference in the spiritual relation among sincere Christians; they partake of the same privileges, and are entitled to the same regards. What amazing changes Divine grace makes! Faithless servants become faithful and beloved brethren, and some who had done wrong, become fellow-workers of good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you - See these verses explained in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21-22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. for the same purpose&#8212;Greek, "for this very purpose."<p>that he might know your estate&#8212;Translate, "that he may know your state": answering to Col 4:7. So one very old manuscript and Vulgate read. But the oldest manuscripts and the old Latin versions, "that YE may know OUR state." However, the latter reading seems likely to have crept in from Eph 6:22. Paul was the more anxious to know the state of the Colossians, on account of the seductions to which they were exposed from false teachers; owing to which he had "great conflict for" them (Col 2:1).<p>comfort your hearts&#8212;distressed as ye are by my imprisonment, as well as by your own trials.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose; </span> who was Paul’s messenger to them, as to let them know how it was with Paul, so to this end: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="bld">That he might know your estate; </span> that he might clearly understand, how their matters stood, <span class="ital">{as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-22.htm" title="Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that you might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.">Ephesians 6:22</a></span>}</span> especially with respect to spirituals, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a>,5</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. <span class="bld">And comfort your hearts; </span> and cheer up their spirits, <span class="ital">{as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-22.htm" title="Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that you might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.">Ephesians 6:22</a></span>}</span> that under the temptations of Satan, and tyranny of persecutors abroad or at home, they might not be discouraged, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;">2 Corinthians 4:17</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/colossians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose,....

He means that the letter and Tychicus are sent together; the aorist, the “epistolary past” of Greek, must be rendered as a perfect in English to convey this thought. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-22.htm" title="Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that you might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.">Ephesians 6:22</a>, where see our note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the same purpose</span>] <span class="bld">For this very purpose</span>, R.V.

The “<span class="ital">purpose</span>” is that just stated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-8.htm" title=" Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;">Colossians 4:8</a>), and now more fully explained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that he might know</span>] <span class="bld">That ye might know</span>, R.V. This is the more probable reading, though the text has considerable support, particularly in early Versions. Lightfoot urges for the change (besides manuscripts) that it is unlikely that St Paul should so emphasize (“<span class="ital">for this very purpose</span>”) Tychicus’ <span class="ital">mission of information</span>, and then suddenly give as its first object <span class="ital">a work of enquiry</span>. Further, that transcribers were more likely to assimilate the person and number of the verb to the “<span class="ital">he might comfort</span>” just below, than elaborately to assimilate a “<span class="ital">he might know</span>” here to the “<span class="ital">ye might know</span>” in Ephesians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">comfort</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/colossians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-8.htm" title=" Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;">Colossians 4:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γνῷ τὰ περὶ ὑμῶν</span>) <span class="greekheb">γνῶτε τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν</span> is found in Al. Colb. 7, etc. It has been transferred to this place from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-22.htm" title="Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that you might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.">Ephesians 6:22</a>. See App. Crit. Ed. 2.[30] on this passage. The two epistles [Ephesians and Colossians] truly have many points of resemblance to one another, but yet so as that the things that need to be changed are changed in each respectively (mutatis mutandis). And generally in parallelisms of this sort, which the officiousness of transcribers has <span class="ital">mixed together</span> [blending the parallel readings of two epistles into one], <span class="ital">one</span> reading in the one place, and <span class="ital">another</span> in the other, is the genuine reading. Tychicus, and through Tychicus (as it appears) Paul, was to learn the state of the <span class="ital">Colossians</span> (whence, instead of <span class="greekheb">γνῷ</span> [third person, viz. Tychicus], <span class="greekheb">γνῶ</span> [first person, viz. Paul] may be also read), just as he learned the state of the Thessalonians through Timothy; that of the Corinthians through Titus; that of the Philippians through Epaphroditus; and more especially did Paul wish to learn that of the Colossians, because he had a great ‘conflict’ on their account [ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm" title=" For I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;">Colossians 2:1</a>]. Moreover the knowledge of the Colossians concerning Paul is sufficiently indicated (marked), not only by the preceding words, as in the Epistle to the Ephesians, but also by those following, which are peculiar to this Epistle to the Colossians: <span class="greekheb">πάντα ὑμῖν γνωριοῦσι τὰ ὧδε</span>.[31]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[30] <span class="greekheb">Γνῶτε τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν</span> is the reading of ABD corrected, (<span class="greekheb">Δ</span>), G<span class="ital">fg</span>, and so Lachm.

The Received Text reads, by a slight confusion of similar Greek letters, <span class="accented">that he may know the things about you</span> (see Lightfoot's 'Notes on some Various Readings'). This is the only clause exactly identical in Colossians and Ephesians. There would be great anxiety on St. Paul's account amongst the Gentile Christians everywhere, and especially in the Asiatic Churches, after the ominous words of his address to the Ephesian elders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22-25</a>: comp. vers. 37, 38). The Colossians had sent through Epaphras messages of love to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-8.htm">Colossians 1:8</a>).
