The people are to pray particularly for their ministers. Believers are exhorted to right conduct towards unbelievers. Be careful in all converse with them, to do them good, and recommend religion by all fit means. Diligence in redeeming time, commends religion to the good opinion of others. Even what is only carelessness may cause a lasting prejudice against the truth. Let all discourse be discreet and seasonable, as becomes Christians. Though it be not always of grace, it must always be with grace. Though our discourse be of that which is common, yet it must be in a Christian manner. Grace is the salt which seasons our discourse, and keeps it from corrupting. It is not enough to answer what is asked, unless we answer aright also.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That I may make it manifest ... - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm">Ephesians 6:20</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Alford thinks that Paul asks their prayers for his release as if it were the "only" way by which he could "make it (the Gospel) manifest" as he ought. But while this is included in their subject of prayer, Php 1:12, 13, written somewhat later in his imprisonment, clearly shows that "a door for the word" could be opened, and was opened, for its manifestation, even while he remained imprisoned (compare 2Ti 2:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That I may manifest, or open and clear, it in due circumstances, as becomes an able minister of Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-15.htm" title="So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.">Romans 1:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1 Corinthians 2:4</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-16.htm" title="For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid on me; yes, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!">1 Corinthians 9:16</a></span> with <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.">2 Timothy 2:15</a> 4:2</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/colossians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That I may make it manifest,.... It being a mystery, a secret, which was hid in God from everlasting, and, during the legal dispensation, was wrapped up in types, and shadows, and sacrifices, and is still hidden unto the natural man. Wherefore the apostle was desirous of making it manifest in a ministerial way; for God only, by his Spirit, makes it manifest in a spiritual, experimental, and saving way. <p>As, says he, <p>I ought to speak. The Arabic version adds, "concerning it", the Gospel, the mystery of Christ. The apostle's meaning is, that he might deliver it with that clearness and evidence, and use that plainness of speech which became the Gospel, and him as a minister of it, and not ambiguous expressions, equivocal phrases, words of double meanings, on purpose to hide things from men, but by manifestation of the truth, to commend himself to every man's conscience in the sight of God. As also to speak it faithfully, declaring the whole counsel of God, keeping back nothing that might be profitable to the churches; and with all constancy and certainty, with all boldness and intrepidity of soul, and freedom of mind; not seeking to please men, aiming at vain glory, and popular applause, or being afraid of their faces, menaces, and reproaches. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-4.htm" title=" That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.">Colossians 4:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἵνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] cannot, seeing that the preceding <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ὁ Θεὸς ἀνοίξῃ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. means the <span class="ital">free</span> preaching <span class="ital">outside of</span> the prison, be dependent either on <span class="greekheb">δέδεμαι</span> (Bengel, Hofmann, comp.

The significant weight of this clause expressing the aim lies in the specification of mode <span class="greekheb">ὡς δεῖ με λαλῆσαι</span>, in which <span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> has the emphasis. To give forth his preaching <span class="ital">in such measure, as it was the necessity of his apostolic destiny to do</span> (<span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span>)—so frankly and without reserve, so free from hindrance, so far and wide from land to land, with such liberty to form churches and to combat erroneous teachings, and so forth<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul was unable, so long as he was in captivity, even when others were allowed access to him. There is a <span class="ital">tragic</span> trait in this <span class="greekheb">ὡς δεῖ με λαλῆσαι</span>, the feeling of <span class="ital">the hindered present</span>. The <span class="ital">traditional</span> explanation is that of Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">μετὰ πολλῆς τῆς παῤῥησίας καὶ μηδὲν ὑποστειλάμενον</span>, namely, <span class="ital">in captivity</span>, where Paul longed to speak <span class="ital">in the right way</span> (de Wette; so usually), or <span class="ital">conformably to higher necessity</span> (Bähr, Huther, comp. Beza, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-16.htm" title="For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid on me; yes, woe is to me, if I preach not the gospel!">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>), or <span class="ital">without allowing himself to be disturbed in his preaching as apostle to the Gentiles</span> by his imprisonment occasioned by <span class="ital">Jewish-Christian</span> hostility (Hofmann). But in opposition to the reference of the whole intercession to the ministry <span class="ital">in prison</span>, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a>. The wish and the hope of working once more <span class="ital">in freedom</span> were so necessarily bound up in Paul with the consciousness of his comprehensive apostolic task, that we can least of all suppose him to have given it up already in Caesarea, where he appealed to the emperor. Even in the Epistle to the Philippians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-25.htm" title="And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;">Php 1:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-24.htm" title="But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.">Php 2:24</a>), his expectation is still in fact directed to renewed freedom of working.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-4.htm" title=" That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.">Colossians 4:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> is variously connected. The usual way is best which connects it with <span class="greekheb">ἀνοίξῃ</span>. This is better than going back to <span class="greekheb">προσευχ</span>., while the connexion with <span class="greekheb">λαλ</span>. is strained. It may be taken (as Beng., Hofm., Sod.) with <span class="greekheb">δέδεμαι</span>, “bound in order that I may manifest,” but if so why should Paul have desired liberty? Soden gives a peculiar turn to the thought. He thinks Paul is bound in order that he may manifest to his judges how he can do no other (<span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span> emphatic) than preach. This seems to be met by Haupt’s criticism that for this we must have had <span class="greekheb">φανερώσω ὅτι δεῖ με λαλῆσαι αὐτό</span>.—<span class="greekheb">φανερώσω</span>. Soden urges in favour of his interpretation that <span class="greekheb">φαν</span>. is never used of Paul’s preaching, but there seems to be no reason why it should not be. It is a stronger word than <span class="greekheb">λαλ</span>., he wants to “make it clear”.—<span class="greekheb">ὡς δεῖ με λαλῆσαι</span> refers to the mode of preaching, but the precise sense is uncertain. Some think it means boldly, others in a way suited to the peculiar circumstances, others in a way that shall be equal to the greatness of the message. Or, again, a reference is assumed by many to the Judaising opposition. But probably the feeling that prompts the words is that in prison his activity was curbed, and he wished to be free that he might preach the Gospel without restriction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">That I may make it manifest</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>.
