Circumstances of life make no difference in the spiritual relation among sincere Christians; they partake of the same privileges, and are entitled to the same regards. What amazing changes Divine grace makes!

This Tychicus was an Asian by birth; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>. His name signifies "fortunate", and is the same with "Fortunatus" in Latin, which name is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-17.htm">1 Corinthians 16:17</a> whether he is the same person may be inquired. It is said that this Tychicus was one of the seventy disciples, and was afterwards bishop of Chalcedon. However, he was employed by the apostle as a messenger to Colosse, as he also was to Ephesus, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a>, to inform the members of the church of his state and condition, how it was with him; as that he was in prison at Rome, for the sake of the Gospel, which he continued to abide by, and held fast the profession of, not being in the least moved and intimidated by what he suffered, being supported by the presence of Christ, and the discoveries of his love; and therefore, though his outward state was very mean and uncomfortable, yet the inward state of his soul was right and good; the inward man was renewed day by day. He might also send word by him what his thoughts were about his deliverance, or his dissolution, and what expectation he had of either of these: and that they might give the greater credit to what Tychicus should relate from him, he gives him the following character, <p>who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister: the same character is given of him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a> to which is here added, <p>and fellow servant in the Lord; he was a "brother" in Christ, being a partaker of the same grace, and in the same spiritual relation; and "beloved" of God, and Christ, of all the churches and saints that knew him, and especially by the apostle; and was also a "minister" of the Gospel, a preacher of Jesus Christ, and a "faithful" one to Christ, to his Gospel, and the souls of men; than which a greater character cannot well be given: and though the apostle was endued with such superior gifts, grace, and usefulness; yet he calls this ministering brother a "fellow servant in the Lord"; he having a commission to preach from the same Lord, and having the same Gospel intrusted with him, and being engaged in the same good work, and having the same ends in view, the glory of Christ, and the good of souls; though he had not equal abilities and qualifications, and was not in the same high post and office as an apostle of Jesus Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/4-7.htm" title=" All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:...">Colossians 4:7-9</a>.

PERSONAL MESSAGES AND GREETINGS. St. Paul concludes his letter, first, by introducing to the Colossians its bearer, Tychicus, along with whom he commends to them their own Onesimus, returning to his master (vers. 7-9); then, according to his custom, he conveys greetings from his various friends and helpers present with him at the time, in particular from Mark, who was likely to visit them, and from Epaphras their own devoted minister (vers. 10-14); thirdly, he sends greeting to the neighbouring and important Church of Laodicea, specially mentioning Nympha, with directions to exchange letters with the Laodiceans, and with a pointed warning to Archippus, probably a Colossian, having some charge over that Church (vers. 15-17). Finally, he appends, with his own hand, his apostolic greeting and benediction (ver. 18). The personal references of this section, though slight and cursory, are of peculiar value, bearing themselves the strongest marks of genuineness, and decisively attesting the Pauline authorship of the Epistle. At the same time, we gather from them several independent facts throwing light on St. Paul's position during his imprisonment, and on his relations to other leading personages of the Church. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that relates to me</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the things concerning me</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant</span> (<span class="accented">bondman</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>will make known to you</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; 1:8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm">Philippians 2:25</a>). Tychicus appears first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>, where he is called an "Asian" (of the Roman province of Asia, of which Ephesus was capital), along with Trophimus, who, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a>, is styled "the Ephesian." He accompanied the apostle on his voyage to Jerusalem (A.D. 58), with a number of others representing different Churches, and deputed, as Lightfoot thinks, in conformity with the directions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3, 4</a>, to convey the contributions raised for "the poor saints at Jerusalem." Trophimus was with St. Paul in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a>), and so, probably, his colleague (the words, "as far as Asia," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>, are of very doubtful authority), he is now with the apostle in his imprisonment at Rome, about to be sent home with these two letters (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21, 22</a>), and in charge of Onesimus, on whose account the apostle sends a private letter to Philemon. In the interval between the first (present) and second imprisonment (2 Timothy), the apostle revisited the Asiatic Churches (so we infer from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>), and Tychicus rejoined him; for we find St. Paul proposing to send him to Titus in Crete (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>), and finally sending him from Rome once more to Ephesus (2 Timothy 6:12). These facts sustain the high terms in which he is here spoken cf. "In the Lord" belongs both to "minister" and "fellow servant." This language is almost identical with that used of Epaphras in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm">Colossians 1:7</a> (see notes). Tychicus is "minister" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), not to Paul himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), nor in the official sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>, but "of Christ," "of the gospel," or "the Church" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>), as St. Paul himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23, 25</a>).
