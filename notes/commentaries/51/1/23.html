Let us adore these mysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If ye continue in the faith - In the belief of the gospel, and in holy living.

But this may mean:<p>(1) That it was designed to be preached to every creature, or that the commission to make it known embraced everyone, and that, so far as the provisions of the gospel are concerned, it may be said that it was a system proclaimed to all mankind; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>. If a vast army, or the inhabitants of a distant province, were in rebellion against a government, and a proclamation of pardon were issued, it would not be improper to say that it was made to every one of them, though, as a matter of fact, it might not be true that everyone in the remote parts of the army or province had actually heard of it.<p>(2) the gospel in the time of Paul seems to have been so extensively preached, that it might be said that it was proclaimed to everybody. All known countries appear to have been visited; and so zealous and laborious had been the heralds of salvation, that it might be said that the message had been proclaimed to all the world; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>.<p>Whereof I Paul am made a minister - See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-7</a>. Paul here pursues the same train of thought which he does in the Epistle to the Ephesians, where, having shown the exalted nature of the Redeemer, and the design of the gospel, he adverts to his own labors and sufferings in making it known. The object seems to be to show that he regarded it as the highest honor to be thus intrusted with the message of mercy to mankind, and considered it as a privilege to suffer in that cause. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

"Grounded" respects the foundation on which believers rest; "settled," their own steadfastness (1Pe 5:10). 1Co 15:58 has the same Greek.<p>not moved away&#8212;by the false teachers.<p>the hope of the gospel&#8212;(Eph 1:18).<p>which ye have heard &#8230; which was preached to every creature &#8230; whereof I &#8230; am &#8230; a minister&#8212;Three arguments against their being "moved away from the Gospel": (1) Their having heard it; (2) The universality of the preaching of it; (3) Paul's ministry in it. For "to (Greek, 'in') every creature," the oldest manuscripts read, "in all creation." Compare "in all the world," Col 1:6; "all things &#8230; in earth," Col 1:20 (Mr 16:15): thus he implies that the Gospel from which he urges them not to be moved, has this mark of truth, namely, the universality of its announcement, which accords with the command and prophecy of Christ Himself (Mt 24:14). By "was preached," he means not merely "is being preached," but has been actually, as an accomplished fact, preached. Pliny, not many years subsequently, in his famous letter to the Emperor Trajan [Epistles, Book X., Epistle 97], writes, "Many of every age, rank, and sex, are being brought to trial. For the contagion of that superstition [Christianity] has spread over not only cities, but villages and the country."<p>whereof I Paul am&#8212;rather as Greek, "was made a minister." Respect for me, the minister of this world-wide Gospel, should lead you not to be moved from it. Moreover (he implies), the Gospel which ye heard from Epaphras, your "minister" (Col 1:7), is the same of which "I was made a minister" (Col 1:25; Eph 3:7): if you be moved from it, ye will desert the teaching of the recognized ministers of the Gospel for unauthorized false teachers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled:</span> this <span class="ital">if</span> doth not import the believers’ continuance in faith to depend merely upon their own free-will, or a carnal doubting of being kept to salvation, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1 Peter 1:5</a></span>, but infers that they are then reconciled to God when they do indeed persevere in the faith; implying that by reason of the seducers amongst them all and every one might not really have that sound faith they would be thought to have.

In the doctrine of faith which they had received and embraced; and in the grace of faith, and the exercise of it which was implanted in them; and in the profession of faith which they had made: not that the virtue and efficacy of Christ's blood, sufferings, and death, and reconciliation of their persons to God thereby, depended upon their faith, and abiding in it; but that faith and continuance in it were necessary means of their presentation in unblemished holiness and righteousness; for if they had not faith, or did not abide in it or if the good work of grace was not wrought upon their souls, and that performed until the day of Christ, they could not be presented holy and blameless: this shows the necessity of the saints' final perseverance in faith and holiness, and is mentioned with this view, to put them upon a concern about it, and to make use of all means, under divine grace, to enjoy it; and nothing could more strongly incline and move unto it, than the blessed effect of Christ's death, reconciliation and the end of it, to present the reconciled ones blameless; in order to which it is necessary they should hold on and out to the end: hence the Ethiopic version reads the words, not as a condition, but as an exhortation enforced by what goes before; "therefore be ye established in the faith": it follows, <p>grounded and settled; not on the sandy foundation of man's own righteousness, and peace made by his own performances; but upon the foundation and rock, Christ, against which the gates of hell cannot prevail; and so shall never finally and totally fall away, being rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith of him, in the doctrines of faith, respecting peace by his blood, justification by his righteousness, and life by his death; and so continue steadfast and immovable, always abounding in his work: <p>and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel; the hope of eternal life and happiness, which as set before us in the Gospel; which that gives a good and solid ground and foundation of, in the person, blood, and righteousness of Christ; and is the instrumental means, in the hand of the Spirit, of begetting to it, and of encouraging and increasing it: the law gives no hopes of eternal life to a poor sinner; it works wrath, and ministers death; there is nothing but a fearful looking for of judgment by it; but the Gospel encourages to hope in the Lord, from the consideration of rich mercy and plenteous redemption in him; and this hope of the Gospel is an anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast, and not to be let go; this confidence and rejoicing of the hope is to be kept firm unto the end: <p>which ye have heard; that is, which Gospel they had heard from Epaphras their faithful minister, and that not only externally, but internally; they had heard it and believed it, and it had brought forth fruit in them; for it came to them not in word only, but in power; which is said in commendation of it, and to engage them to continue in it, and abide by it; as is also what follows: <p>and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; and therefore since it was the same which was everywhere preached, they might depend upon the truth of it, should have the greater value for it, and by no means relinquish it. This must be understood not of every individual creature, even human and rational, that was then, or had been in, the world; but that it had been, and was preached far and near, in all places all over the world, to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews; who are sometimes styled "every creature", "the creature", "the whole creation", "all men", &amp;c. see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-11.htm">Titus 2:11</a>; and of this, the first preaching of the Gospel by Peter after our Lord's resurrection, was an emblem and pledge, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-14.htm">Acts 2:14</a>; and some time after that, the sound of all the apostles went into all the earth, and their words to the end of the world: <p>whereof I Paul am made a minister; by Jesus Christ, who appeared unto him, and called, qualified, and sent him forth as such; and this is mentioned to encourage the Colossians to abide by the truths of the Gospel, since what they had heard and received were what were everywhere preached by the faithful ministers of the word; and particularly by the apostle, who was ordained to be a teacher and preacher of it to the Gentiles.

The frequent emphasis laid upon knowledge, insight, comprehension, and the like, is not to be put to the account of an intellectualism, which forms a fundamental peculiarity betokening the author and age of this Epistle (and especially of that to the Ephesians), as Holtzmann conceives, p. 216 ff.; on the contrary, it was owing to the attitude of the apostle towards the antagonistic philosophical speculations. Comp. also Grau, <span class="ital">Entwickelungsgesch. d. N. T.</span> II. p. 153 ff. It was owing to the necessary relations, in which the apostle, with his peculiarity of being all things to all men, found himself placed towards the interests of the time and place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[60] According to Baur, indeed, such passages as the present are among those which betray the <span class="ital">double personality</span> of the author.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm" title=" If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;">Colossians 1:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἴ γε</span> with the indicative expresses the Apostle’s confidence that the condition will be fulfilled.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπιμένετε</span>. This abiding in faith is the only, as it is the sure way, to this presentation of themselves <span class="greekheb">κατ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτ</span>. This is directed against the false teachers’ assurance that the gospel they had heard needed to be supplemented if they wished to attain salvation. It needs no supplementing, and it is at the peril of salvation that they lose hold of it.—<span class="greekheb">τεθεμελιωμένοι</span> refers to the firm foundation, <span class="greekheb">ἑδραῖοι</span> to the stability of the building.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ μετακινούμενοι</span>. The perfect participle here gives way to the present, expressing a continuous process. It may be passive or middle, probably the former.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐλπίδος τοῦ εὐαγγελίου</span>: to be taken with <span class="greekheb">μετακιν</span>. alone, not, assuming a zeugma, with the three co-ordinate expressions (Sod.), for it is not at all clear that the last of these keeps up the metaphor of a building. The hope of the Gospel is the hope given by or proclaimed in the Gospel.—<span class="greekheb">οὗ ἠκούσατε</span>. Paul again sets his seal on the form of the Gospel which they had received, and again insists on the universality of its proclamation, its catholicity as guaranteeing its truth (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-5.htm" title=" For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;...">Colossians 1:5-7</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ἐν πασῇ κτίσει</span>: “in presence of every creature”; <span class="greekheb">π</span>. <span class="greekheb">κτ</span>., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>, with the limitation <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐρ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">οὗ ἐγενόμην ἐγὼ Παῦλος διάκονος</span>: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm" title="Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power.">Ephesians 3:7</a>. This phrase contains a certain stately self-assertion; the Apostle urges the fact that he is a minister of this Gospel as a reason why they should remain faithful to it. His apostolic authority, so far from being impugned by the false teachers, was more probably invoked; so Paul throws it in the balance against them. It is also true that the Gentile mission was so bound up in his own mind with his apostleship that a reference to the one naturally suggested a reference to the other. By this clause Paul effects the transition to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">if</span>] With a certain emphasis in the Greek, <span class="ital">pressing</span> on the saints the need of watching and prayer; a need which leaves untouched in their proper sphere the sure promises of the “final perseverance” of the saints.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“If we look to stand in the faith of the sons of God, we must hourly, continually, be providing and setting ourselves to strive … To our own safety our own sedulity is required.

As present indicative, it implies a (supposed) actual state. "The faith," as regularly in the New Testament, is the act and exercise of faith (subjective), not the content or matter of faith (objective). "Grounded" or "founded," perfect passive, implies a fixed condition (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-18.htm">Ephesians 3:18</a>, coupled with "rooted;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-48.htm">Luke 6:48</a>).

The words, and not being moved away (or, <span class="accented">letting yourselves be moved away</span>), put the same assumption negatively, and more specifically as he adds, from the hope of the gospel; <span class="accented">good tidings</span> (vers. 5, 27; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-13.htm">2 Corinthians 4:13-5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm">Hebrews 6:11, 18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-35.htm">Hebrews 10:35, 36</a>) - that which is its peculiar property and glory, the crown of Christ's redeeming work (ver. 22), the end of his servant's labours (ver. 28), for which, by anticipation, he already gives thanks (ver. 5). but which was directly threatened and brought in question by Colossian error (see notes on Colossians 2:18; 3:15). (<span class="accented">The gospel</span>) which you heard (vers. 5, 7: notes), which was preached in all creation that is under the heaven (ver. 6; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-26.htm">Romans 16:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>). The transition from "you" to "all creation" resembles that of vers. 5, 6 (comp. vers. 20, 21). "Preached" is literally" heralded," "loudly and officially announced;" so, frequently in St. Paul (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>), also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>. Greek usage does not support the interpretation which makes <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("creation ") equivalent to "humanity." This sense of the word, which, even in Mark, such interpreters as Bengel, Lange, Alford, reject, is quite Hebraistic and exceptional. The phrase, "all creation," the writer has already used in ver. 15; here, as there (see here), without the article (Revised Text). The universal meaning it carries there is now limited by "under the heaven." The <span class="accented">earthly creation</span> subject as it is to Christ, is the sphere of this proclamation, the <span class="accented">preaching room</span> which is to resound everywhere with the glad tidings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-7.htm">Psalm 98:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-2.htm">Revelation 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-6.htm">Revelation 14:6</a>). And with this range it <span class="accented">was proclaimed</span>, for from the first it claimed universal audience. Whereof I became, I Paul, a minister (vers. 24-29; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm">2 Timothy 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-5.htm">1 Corinthians 3:5, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1, 2, 16, 17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1, 15, 16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16-18</a>). (For "minister," see ver. 7.) The later Epistles betray a markedly heightened sense in the apostle of the unique dignity and importance of his own position, and those who question their authenticity press this fact against them. But the difference of tone is what one would expect in "such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-9.htm">Philemon 1:9</a>). As the Gentile Churches grew, reverence for his person deepened; and the success of his life mission became more assured, especially now that the struggle with reactionary Judaism, signalized by the Epistles of the third missionary journey, was to a large extent decided in his favour. The false teachers he is now opposing did not, we should gather, attack the apostle personally; but may rather have claimed to be on his side. The movement of thought we have followed in vers. 15-23 proceeds from <span class="accented">Christ's redeeming work</span> to <span class="accented">the experience of the Colossians</span> in receiving it, and <span class="accented">the labours of the apostle</span> in publishing it; and is parallel to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-3:13</a>.
