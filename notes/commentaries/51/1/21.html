Let us adore these mysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And you, that were sometime alienated - In this work of reconciling heaven and earth, you at Colossae, who were once enemies of God, have been reached. The benefit of that great plan has been extended to you, and it has accomplished in you what it is designed to effect everywhere - to reconcile enemies to God. The word "sometime" here - &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  pote - means "formerly." In common with all other men they were, by nature, in a state of enmity against God; compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>.<p>In your mind - It was not merely by wicked works, or by an evil life; it was alienation seated in the mind, and leading to wicked works. It was deliberate and purposed enmity. It was not the result of passion and excitement; it had a deeper seat, and took hold of the intellectual powers The understanding was perverse and alienated from God, and all the powers of the soul were enlisted against him. It is this fact which renders reconciliation with God so difficult. Sin has corrupted and perverted alike the moral and the intellectual powers, and thus the whole man is arrayed against his Creator; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>.<p>By wicked works - The alienation of the mind showed itself by wicked works, and those works were the public evidence of the alienation; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-2</a>.<p>Yet now hath he reconciled - Harmony has been secured between you and God, and you are brought to friendship and love. Such a change has been produced in you as to bring your minds into friendship with that of God. All the change in producing this is on the part of man, for God cannot change, and there is no reason why he should, if he could. In the work of reconciliation man lays aside his hostility to his Maker, and thus becomes his friend; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

The general blessing of grace and reconciliation, which belongs to the whole body of Christ, the church universal, all the elect of God, whether in heaven or in earth, is here particularly applied to the saints at Colosse, who were eminent instances of it; and that the free grace of God towards them in it might more illustriously appear, the apostle takes notice of what they were before the coming of Christ in the flesh, before the Gospel came among them, and while in a state of unregeneracy, as that they were "alienated": that is from God, not from his general presence, power, and providence, which reach to all his creatures, but from the life of God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>; from living agreeably to the will of God, being estranged from him who is the fountain of moral and spiritual, as well as natural life; from the law, the rule of life, and from a principle of life in themselves; and altogether disapproving of such a life, as contrary to their carnal affections and lusts: and which alienation from God greatly lay in their forsaking him, the one only and true God, and following and serving strange gods, not attending to the dictates and light of nature; and being destitute of a divine revelation, they went further and further off from God, and from his people, worship, and ordinances; and were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise; the source of all which was sin, and was owing to themselves: God did not alienate himself from them first; they alienated themselves from him; their sins separated between God and them, set them at a distance from him, and at enmity to him, and which very early appeared, for they were estranged from the womb: <p>and enemies in your mind by wicked works. They were enemies to God, the true God, and were lovers and worshippers of idols; they were enemies to the being and perfections of God, as all men in a state of nature are; and more or less show it, by either denying there is a God, or wishing there was none, or fancying him to be such an one as themselves; or they dispute his sovereignty, deny his omniscience, arraign his justice and faithfulness, and despise the riches of his grace and goodness; they are enemies to his purposes, providences, and word; cannot bear that he should determine any thing concerning them or others; their eye is evil to him because he is good to others; they reply against him, they run upon him, and charge his decrees with unrighteousness and cruelty; murmur at and quarrel with the dispensations of his providence, as unequal and unjust; cast away the law of the Lord, will not be subject to it, and condemn the revelation of his will. They are enemies to Christ in one shape or another; either to his person, denying his proper deity, or real humanity; or to his offices, not hearkening to him as a prophet, trampling on his blood and sacrifice as a priest, and unwilling to have him to rule over them as a King; or to the way of salvation by him, of pardon by his blood, atonement by his sacrifice, justification by his righteousness, and acceptance with God through his person; or to his doctrines and ordinances, which are unsuitable to their vicious tastes, carnal affections, and appetites: they are enemies to the Spirit of Christ, by either denying his deity and personality, or by ridiculing the operations of his grace; or treating with contempt, and as foolish, everything of his, the Bible and all the truths contained in it, dictated by him. They are enemies to the people of God, exceeding mad against them, hate them and persecute them, reckon them the faith of the world, and the offscouring of all things, living in malice to them, and hateful and hating one another: and this enmity to everything divine and good is seated "in the mind"; the mind is not the object of this enmity, as some read the words, "to the mind": for the mind of a carnal man is enmity itself against God; but it is the subject of it, where it has its chief place, and from whence it proceeds, and shows itself in evil actions; and though the word "your" is not in the original text, it is rightly supplied; for the meaning is not that they were enemies "of his mind"; of the mind of the Lord, of his counsels and will, as some read and explain the words, though there is a truth in this, but in their own minds: so that not the body but the soul is the seat of this enmity; and not the inferior faculties of the soul only, the sensitive appetite and passions, but the understanding, the judgment and will, the more noble and rational powers of the soul; from hence spring all the malice and enmity expressed in word and actions: where then is man's free will to that which is good? and hence it is that the mind stands in need of being renewed, enlightened, cleansed and sanctified, and renovation begins here, which is the effect of almighty power; for nothing else can remove the rooted enmity in the heart of men; and which, as deep and as secret as it is, sooner or later, in one way or another, shows itself "by wicked works"; and that frequently, as by loving what God hates, and hating what he loves; by omitting what he commands, and committing what he forbids; by maintaining friendship with the world, and by harbouring his professed enemies, and persecuting his dear friends; and by their wicked words, and evil lives and conversations; and by the various works of the flesh, which are manifest, some being more directly against God, others by which they wrong themselves, and others by which they injure their neighbours: <p>yet now hath he reconciled; which may be understood either of the Father's reconciling them to himself by his Son; and so the words are a continuation of the account of the Father's grace, as to all the elect in general, so to the Colossians in particular, notwithstanding the black characters in which they stand described in their natural estate: or else of Christ's reconciling them to his Father, by the sacrifice of himself, which he voluntarily offered for them, though this was their case, and of enemies made them friends: and may be meant either of the impetration of reconciliation for them by his sufferings and death; or of the virtue and efficacy of it in the application of it; in the former sense the "now" refers to the coming of Christ into the world, and the time of his death, and the offering up of his body once for all, when peace and reconciliation were completely made at once for all God's elect; in the latter sense it refers to the time of the conversion of these Colossians, when Christ by his Spirit, in consequence of reconciliation made in the body of his flesh, through death reconciled them to God; to his mind and will, to the way of salvation by himself, to the saints the excellent in the earth, to the Gospel and the ordinances of it, and to all his ways and worship. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in <i>your</i> mind by wicked works, yet now hath <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> he reconciled</span><p>(10) Sanctification is another work of God in us by Christ, in that that he restored us (who hated God extremely and were wholly and willingly given to sin) to his gracious favour in such a way that he in addition purifies us with his Holy Spirit, and consecrates us to righteousness.<p>(o) The Son.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>.

Usually <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμᾶς</span> is made to begin a new sentence. Even with the reading <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατήλλαξεν</span> the construction is not quite regular, but with the probably correct reading, <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατηλλάγητε</span>, a violent break in the context is involved, since Paul begins with the second person as the object and suddenly makes it the subject. Such an anacoluthon is possible in dictation, but very improbable unless several words had intervened, so that the beginning of the sentence should be forgotten. This is not the case here. Lachmann (followed by Lightf. and others) takes <span class="greekheb">νυνὶ δὲ</span> … <span class="greekheb">θανάτου</span> as a parenthesis, in which case <span class="greekheb">παραστῆσαι</span> depends on <span class="greekheb">εὐδόκησε</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> is repeated “to disentangle the construction”. The irregularity is thus avoided. Haupt objects that it is unlikely that Paul should have continued after so long a sentence as <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a> with the same construction, and also that the thought in this part of the sentence, “to present you holy,” is not co-ordinated to the thoughts in <span class="greekheb">κατοικ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατ</span>. For in the latter the thought is that it is the Son in whom the fulness dwells and through whom reconciliation is effected. But this thought of the pre-eminence of the Son in the work of salvation is not continued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>, where the thought is of the Christian standing of the Colossians before God. It is therefore unlikely that <span class="greekheb">παραστ</span>. should depend on <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκ</span>. Accordingly, with Haupt and Weiss, a comma should be placed at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>, and a full stop at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a> will then depend on <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατ</span>. It might seem an anti-climax after the wide sweep of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a> to narrow down the reference to the Colossians. But we have a similar case in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm" title=" Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:">Colossians 1:6</a>, and the personal application of a universal truth is anti-climax only to a rhetorician. The danger of the Colossians makes it peculiarly appropriate here.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμᾶς</span>: “you also”.—<span class="greekheb">ὄντας</span> emphasises that this state was continuous.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπηλλοτριωμένους</span>: “estranged,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, from God, probably not to be taken as counted as aliens by God, but as expressing their attitude to God.—<span class="greekheb">ἐχθροὺς τῇ διανοίᾳ</span>. Meyer takes <span class="greekheb">ἐχθ</span>. as passive, regarded as enemies by God, but the qualification <span class="greekheb">τῇ διαν</span>. and the further addition <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πον</span>. makes this very improbable. It involves the translation of <span class="greekheb">τῇ διαν</span>. “on account of your state of mind,” for which <span class="greekheb">διά</span> with the accusative would have been expected. But it is much simpler to take <span class="greekheb">διαν</span>. as dative of the part affected, and <span class="greekheb">ἐχθ</span>. as active, hostile to God in your mind. <span class="greekheb">διανοία</span> (used only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm" title="Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm" title="Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:">Ephesians 4:18</a> by Paul) means the higher intellectual nature, but specially on the ethical side; it is usually in the LXX the translation of “heart”.

But this side of the fact is less prominent here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in your mind</span>] The word rendered “<span class="ital">mind</span>” commonly denotes the rational powers in general; cp. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-13.htm" title="Why gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;">1 Peter 1:13</a>.

The combination of <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("being") with perfect passive participle ("having been alienated") implies a fixed condition, that has become as a part of one's nature (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>, Revised Text). As the opposite of "reconciled," "alienated" is strictly passive, and denotes, not a subjective feeling on the part of the sinner, but an objective determination on the part of God, an exclusion from the Divine favour, from "the kingdom of the Son" and "the lot of the saints" (vers. 12, 13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3, 11-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>: comp. usage of LXX in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9; 1</a> Esdr. 9:4; Sir. 11:34). "Enemies in your thought" sets forth the disposition of the sinner towards God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-18.htm">Philippians 3:18</a>: so Alford,Ellicott, Lightfoot). Meyer maintains the passive sense of "enemies," as found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-16.htm">Galatians 4:16</a>. On the latter view, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> is instrumental dative, "by," "in virtue of your state of mind;" on the former, it is dative of reference or definition. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (here only and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a> and Ephesians 4:18 in St. Paul) has possibly a polemical reference. It denotes in Greek philosophy, the faculty of <span class="accented">thought</span>, as opposed to the bodily powers. In Philo's teaching it signifies the higher part of human nature, akin to God, and opposed to evil which belongs to the senses: "Thought (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is the best thing in us" ('On Fugitives,' &sect; 26); "Every man in regard to his intellect (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is united to the Divine Word, being an impression or fragment or ray of that blessed nature; but in respect of his body he belongs to the entire world" ('On the Creation of the World,' &sect; 51). But here sin is associated With <span class="accented">the intellect in</span> man, and redemption with "the body of Christ's flesh" (ver. 22): comp. notes on "reason," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>, and "body," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>, where <span class="accented">the reason</span> is vain, <span class="accented">the intellect</span> darkened. "Wicked [emphasized by its position in the Greek, denoting <span class="accented">active</span> evil; see Trench's 'Synonyms,' on <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>] works" is a phrase common in St. John, only used here by St. Paul (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-7.htm">Colossians 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). These <span class="accented">works</span> are the practices of life in which the sinner is abidingly excluded from "the kingdom of Christ and God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>), and manifests the radical antipathy of his mind toward God. "Yet [or, 'but'] now:" comp. ver. 26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-8.htm">Colossians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>, etc. - a lively form of transition characteristic of St. Paul, primarily temporal, then also logical in sense. "Were ye reconciled" breaks through the grammatical structure of the sentence, as in vers. 26, 27 (see Lightfoot, and Winer's 'N. T. Grammar,' p. 717). If "did he reconcile" (or, "hath he reconciled") be the correct reading, "Christ" is still subject of the verb, as in vers. 19-22, and consistently with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 16</a>.
