In the Ephesian Epistle this declaration is made a direct introduction to practical exhortation (comp. Col. 4, 5, 6); here it leads up to the earnest remonstrance against speculative errors in Colossians 2, which precedes a similar practical exhortation. In both cases he dwells on the committal to him of a special dispensation; in both he rejoices in suffering as a means of spiritual influence; in both cases he declares the one object to be the presentation of each man perfect before Christ.<p>(24) <span class= "bld">Who now rejoice.</span>—In the true reading of the original there is no relative pronoun. The sentence starts with emphatic abruptness, “Now (at this moment) I rejoice” (just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-9.htm" title="Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing.">2Corinthians 7:9</a>). In all the three Epistles of the Captivity this same rejoicing is declared in himself and urged on his brethren. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>, “I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory;” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm" title="And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.">Philippians 2:11</a>, “Yea, if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all. For the same cause do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.” There, as here, the rejoicing is in suffering, not in itself, not solely because it is borne with and for Christ, but also because it is for the sake of the Church. Here, however, this idea is expressed with far greater emphasis.<p><span class= "bld">Fill up that which is behind of the afflictions</span> <span class= "bld">of Christ.</span>—The sense of this passage is at first sight startling, but it could not have been thought difficult or doubtful, had not false inferences from it tempted men to shrink from the obvious meaning. Now, (1) the “afflictions of Christ” is a phrase not used elsewhere; for “affliction” (properly, <span class= "ital">hard and galling pressure</span>) is the ordinary burden of life, and is generally spoken of only as coming on His servants. But, like the common phrase “the sufferings of Christ” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-15.htm" title="But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.">1Peter 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-1.htm" title="The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:">1Peter 5:1</a>), it must moan the afflictions which He endured. It is true, as has been thoughtfully suggested (see Chrysostom and others on the passage) that we are to count as His the afflictions of His Church; but still, even if we are to include these indirect afflictions, we cannot possibly exclude the direct. Next, (2) St. Paul expressly says (in the full force of the original) that “he fills up <span class= "ital">instead”</span> of his Master, what is still left unfinished of his Master’s afflictions. (See the passages quoted by Dr. Lightfoot in his note on this verse.) He declares, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that, succeeding to the suffering of Christ, he carries it out for the sake of His body the Church. This is, indeed, nothing but a clearer and more striking expression of the truth conveyed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds by Christ.">2Corinthians 1:5</a>, “The sufferings of Christ overflow to us,” so that we bear our part, in addition to the full measure which He bore; and even in the commoner expression, to be “partaker of Christ’s sufferings” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-13.htm" title="But rejoice, inasmuch as you are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy.">1Peter 4:13</a>), or “to drink of His cup and be baptised with His baptism” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/20-22.htm" title="But Jesus answered and said, You know not what you ask. Are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to him, We are able.">Matthew 20:22-23</a>). But, (3) looking to the meaning and use of the word “afflictions,” we note that “the afflictions of Christ” must be His sufferings on earth considered simply as a part—though immeasurably the chief part—of the burden of humanity in a sinful world, They represent, not the Cross of Atonement, on which He alone could suffer—and in which any reader of St. Paul must find it absurd to suppose that he would claim the slightest share—but the Cross of struggle against sin even to death, which He expressly bade us “take up if we would follow Him.” This He has still left “behind;” this in His strength every one of His servants bears, partly for himself, partly also for others. In the former light St. Paul says, “The world is crucified to me, and I to the world” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm" title="But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.">Galatians 6:14</a>); in the latter he claims it as his highest privilege “to fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ for His Body which is the Church.”<p><span class= "bld">In my flesh for his body’s sake.</span>—There is obviously an antithesis here. St. Paul suffers in his natural body for the mystical Body of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/colossians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:...">Colossians 1:24-29</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you </span>— Endured for your benefit, having been exposed to them in consequence of my preaching the gospel to you and other Gentiles; <span class="ital">and fill up </span>— That is, whereby I fill up; <span class="ital">that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ </span>— That which remains to be suffered by his members.

But He suffered for the redemption of the church; we suffer on other accounts; for we do but slightly taste that cup of afflictions of which Christ first drank deeply. A Christian may be said to fill up that which remains of the sufferings of Christ, when he takes up his cross, and after the pattern of Christ, bears patiently the afflictions God allots to him. Let us be thankful that God has made known to us mysteries hidden from ages and generations, and has showed the riches of his glory among us. As Christ is preached among us, let us seriously inquire, whether he dwells and reigns in us; for this alone can warrant our assured hope of his glory.

It was not for the Colossians alone, but he regarded himself as suffering on account of his labors in preaching to the pagan at large. His trials at Rome had come upon him because he had maintained that the wall of partition between Jews and Gentiles was broken down, and that the gospel was to be preached indiscriminately to all mankind; see this illustrated in the introduction, Section 5.<p>And fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ - That which I lack of coming up to the sufferings which Christ endured in the cause of the church. The apostle seems to mean:<p>(1) that be suffered in the same cause as that for which Christ suffered;<p>(2) that he endured the same kind of sufferings, to some extent, in reproaches, persecutions, and opposition from the world;<p>(3) that he had not yet suffered as much as Christ did in this cause, and, though be had suffered greatly, yet there was much that was lacking to make him equal in this respect to the Saviour; and,<p>(4) that he felt that it was an object to be earnestly desired to be made in all respects just like Christ, and that in his present circumstances he was fast filling up that which was lacking, so that he would have a more complete resemblance to him.<p>What he says here is based on the leading desire of his soul - the great principle of his life - to be just like Christ; alike in moral character, in suffering, and in destiny; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>. Having this strong wish, he had been led to pursue a course of life which conducted him through trials strongly resembling those which Christ himself endured; and, as fast as possible, he was filling up that in which he now fell short. He does not mean that there was anything lacking or deficient in the sufferings which Christ endured in making an atonement which was to be supplied by his followers, so that their merits might be added to his in order to secure the salvation of men, as the Romanists seem to suppose; but that there was still much lacking on his part before he should be entirely conformed to the Saviour in his sufferings, and that his present condition was such as rapidly to fill that up. This seems to me to be the fair meaning of this expressions though not the one commonly given. The usual interpretation is, "that which remains to me of affliction to be endured in the cause of Christ." But this seems to me to be cold and tame, and not to suit the genius of Paul.<p>In my flesh - In bodily sufferings.<p>For his body's sake, which is the church - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. Who&#8212;The oldest manuscripts omit "who"; then translate, "Now I rejoice." Some very old manuscripts, and the best of the Latin versions, and Vulgate, read as English Version. To enhance the glory of Christ as paramount to all, he mentions his own sufferings for the Church of Christ. "Now" stands in contrast to "I was made," in the past time (Col 1:23).<p>for you&#8212;"on your behalf," that ye may be confirmed in resting solely on Christ (to the exclusion of angel-worship) by the glorification of Christ in my sufferings (Eph 3:1).<p>fill up that which is behind&#8212;literally, "the deficiencies"&#8212;all that are lacking of the afflictions of Christ (compare Note, see on [2408]2Co 1:5). Christ is "afflicted in all His people's afflictions" (Isa 63:9). "The Church is His body in which He is, dwells, lives, and therefore also suffers" [Vitringa]. Christ was destined to endure certain afflictions in this figurative body, as well as in His literal; these were "that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ," which Paul "filled up." His own meritorious sufferings in expiation for sin were once for all completely filled up on the Cross. But His Church (His second Self) has her whole measure of afflictions fixed. The more Paul, a member, endured, the less remain for the rest of the Church to endure; the communion of saints thus giving them an interest in his sufferings. It is in reference to the Church's afflictions, which are "Christ's afflictions, that Paul here saith, "I fill up the deficiencies," or "what remain behind of the afflictions of Christ." She is afflicted to promote her growth in holiness, and her completeness in Christ. Not one suffering is lost (Ps 56:8). All her members have thus a mutual interest in one another's sufferings (1Co 12:26). But Rome's inference hence, is utterly false that the Church has a stock treasury of the merits and satisfactions of Christ and His apostles, out of which she may dispense indulgences; the context has no reference to sufferings in expiation of sin and productive of merit. Believers should regard their sufferings less in relation to themselves as individuals, and more as parts of a grand whole, carrying out God's perfect plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you; </span> he confirms his call to the ministry of the gospel from his cheerfulness in his present sufferings, so that they should not be discenraged, being it highly contented him to witness and seal his doctrine by bearing his cross for them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-2.htm" title="And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?">Revelation 5:2</a>,3 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-4.htm" title="Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.">2 Corinthians 7:4</a></span>: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-14.htm" title="And many of the brothers in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.">Philippians 1:14</a>,20 2:17</span>.

The apostle, as soon as he had made mention of his being a minister of the Gospel, thinks and speaks of his "sufferings"; for those are what always more or less attend persons in such an office; they are appointed to them by God; Christ has foretold them of them; they are necessary for them; they must expect them, and patiently endure them: the apostle was under them now at this present time, for he wrote this epistle in his bonds when a prisoner at Rome, not for any immorality, any crime he had committed, but for Christ's sake, for his Gospel's sake, for the sake of the churches of Christ to whom he preached, for the confirmation of them, and so of these Colossians; and therefore he says, "for you"; and which he mentions to animate them to abide by the Gospel, for which he was suffering, that it might continue with them and others: nor was he distressed and discouraged at his afflictions, he "rejoiced" in them, because he had the presence of God in them, the Spirit of God and of glory rested on him, and God was glorified by them; he esteemed it an honour done him that grace was given, and he counted worthy to suffer for the sake of Christ; and as well knowing that he should live and reign with him, since he suffered with him and for him: and what greatly caused and increased his joy was what follows, <p>and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh; by which are meant not the afflictions or sufferings of Christ in his own person; for these were all over, he was now entered into his glory, was exalted at the Father's right hand, and was crowned with glory and honour: there was nothing left behind of his sufferings, to be undergone by any of his people; he had drank of the cup and all the dregs of it; he had sustained the whole of his Father's wrath, and all the curses of the law, being abated nothing, but was made perfect through sufferings; having perfectly suffered all, he suffered once and once for all, he will suffer no more; nor is there any need of his suffering more or again, for he has finished sin, wrought righteousness, made peace, and obtained eternal redemption; nor had he any partner in his sufferings, nor did he need any, or left any part of his sufferings to be filled up by others; for he endured all and the whole, which the law and justice of God could require in his own body, in the body of his flesh through death; of these sufferings the apostle does not speak, but of such which he filled up in "his" own "flesh"; and design the afflictions of Christ in his members, which are called "his", because of that near union there is between Christ and them; so that what befalls them may be predicated of him; when anyone of them suffers, he suffers with him, as the sufferings of a part of the body are ascribed to the whole person; and because of that sympathy there is between them, he has a fellow feeling with his people in all their infirmities; in all their afflictions he is afflicted: if Saul persecutes his saints, he persecutes him; whatever injury is done to them, he takes it as done to himself, who are to him as the apple of his eye. Moreover, hereby they are conformed unto him, and made like him; as he was, so are they in this world; there is a good deal of likeness between the afflictions of Christ and his people, though in some things there is a great disparity; add to this, that the afflictions of the saints are endured for Christ's sake, for the sake of his Gospel, and the profession of his name, and therefore called his, and the more cheerfully bore by them: now of these there were some remains to be filled up by the apostle; not that all the afflictions of the whole body of Christ were to be, or have been filled up by him; there was a great deal left behind by him to be filled up by others, and which has been filling up ever since, and still is, and yet all is not fulfilled to this day, nor will be till the end of time; but he speaks only of that part and measure of them, which was to be tilled up in his flesh; he had his measure of afflictions allotted to him, great part of which he had endured already, but some remained, the measure was not yet full, though pretty near being completed, which gave him pleasure; it was just filling up, and the time of his departure was at hand, when there would be no more sorrow; for it was only while he was in the flesh he was filling up this measure, and would be quickly up; and what added to his joy was, that as these were the afflictions of Christ, and the measure of them was appointed by his heavenly Father, to be filled up by him in this mortal state, so they were <p>for his body's sake, which is the church; not in the room and stead of the church, and people of Christ, as were the sufferings of Christ personal; or to exempt them from sufferings who all have their share in this life; nor for their sins to make reconciliation for them, and procure the remission of them; nor to redeem them, or obtain salvation for them, all which is completed by Christ; but for their good and profit, that the Gospel might continue and be blessed to the conversion of many, for the increase of the church and additions to it, and for the furtherance of the Gospel, and that such who professed it might be established and confirmed in it, by the sufferings of the apostle for it: and such good effects did follow upon his sufferings and afflictions; they were for the consolation of many souls, the strengthening of weak believers, and causing even preachers of the Gospel to wax more confident, and more boldly preach the Gospel without fear of man. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who now rejoice in my sufferings for <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> you, and fill up <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:</span><p>(r) For our profit and benefit.<p>(s) The afflictions of the Church are said to be Christ's afflictions, by reason of that fellowship and knitting together that the body and the head have with one another.

That Paul is now, in his captivity fraught with danger to life, on the point (the <span class="ital">present</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀνταναπλ</span>. indicating the being in the act, see Bernhardy, p. 370) of filling up all that still remains behind of this measure of affliction, that he is therefore engaged in the final full solution of his task of suffering, without leaving a single <span class="greekheb">ὑστέρημα</span> in it,—this he regards as something grand and glorious, and therefore utters the <span class="greekheb">ἀνταναπληρῶ</span>, which bears the emphasis at the head of this declaration, with all the sense of <span class="ital">triumph</span> which the approaching completion of such a work involves. “<span class="ital">I rejoice on account of the sufferings which I endure for you, and</span>—so highly have I to esteem this situation of affliction<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I am in the course of furnishing the complete fulfilment of what in my case still remains in arrear of fellowship of affliction with Christ</span>.” This lofty consciousness, this feeling of the grandeur of the case, very naturally involved not only the selection of the most graphic expression possible, <span class="greekheb">ἀνταναπληρῶ</span>, to be emphatically prefixed, but also the description, in the most honourable and sublime manner possible, of the apostolic afflictions themselves as the <span class="greekheb">θλίψεις τοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>,[64] since in their kind and nature they are no other than those which Christ Himself has suffered.

The verb rendered “<span class="ital">fill up</span>” by A.V. is a double compound (found here only in the Greek Scriptures) conveying the thought of a supply <span class="ital">occasioned by, fitted to, a demand</span>. (See Lightfoot’s quotations.) The word rendered “<span class="ital">sufferings</span>” is better “<span class="ital">afflictions</span>,” or more exactly “<span class="ital">tribulations</span>,” “<span class="ital">troubles</span>.” It is nowhere else in N.T. used of our blessed Lord’s experiences, though it occurs in the Psalm of the Crucifixion, 22:(21 in the LXX.)11. Its ordinary reference is not to the pains of <span class="ital">death</span> but to the toils and anguish of persecution, and generally to the trials of a burthened <span class="ital">life</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thus there is no suggestion here of any supplement added by Paul to the unique Sufferings of the Propitiator in His atoning Death; a sorrow and labour in which the Lord stood absolutely alone, unapproachable for ever by any or all of His people, “bearing their sins,” “made a curse for them.” The reference is to the toils, shame, and persecution of the Lord’s life and labour as “<span class="ital">the Apostle</span> of our profession” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>), our supreme Evangelist and Pastor. In <span class="ital">these</span> “troubles,” though indeed preeminent, He was not unique. He only “<span class="ital">began</span> to do and to teach” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-1.htm" title="The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,">Acts 1:1</a>) personally what through His members He was to carry on the end, and what was in this respect left incomplete when He quitted earth. Every true toiler and sufferer for Him and His flock contributes to the “filling up” of that incompleteness, so far as he toils and bears <span class="ital">in Christ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The idea of expiation or satisfaction is wholly absent from this passage” (Lightfoot).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“The Apostle entered deep into the spirit of his suffering Master when he wrote those words, so embarrassing for the commentators, so edifying for the simple, where the sufferings of the disciple are made almost as necessary for the instruction of the Church as those of the Saviour for its redemption.” (Ad. Monod, <span class="ital">Saint Paul, Cinq Discours</span>, p. 55.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in my flesh</span>] Connect these words with “<span class="ital">fill up</span>,” not with “<span class="ital">afflictions of Christ</span>” as some expositors. True, “in all their affliction He is afflicted” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-9.htm" title="In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.">Isaiah 63:9</a>); and so in a tender sense He was “afflicted in” His servant’s “flesh,” his sensibilities and powers in bodily life. But, as Lightfoot points out, this explanation here is out of harmony with the verb “<span class="ital">fill up as required</span>.” The thought is of tribulations necessary for the practical ends of gathering in and building up the Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for his body’s sake</span>, &c.] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm" title="Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.">2 Timothy 2:10</a>, a close parallel.

These <span class="accented">afflictions</span> are "the sufferings of the Christ" in their <span class="accented">ministerial</span> as distinguished from their <span class="accented">mediatorial</span> aspect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The latter sense is, however, put on the phrase by Romanist divines, who quote the text in support of the doctrine of the merit of the saints, in contradiction to the uniform teaching of St. Paul and the whole New Testament, that the sacrifice of Christ is the sole meritorious ground of salvation for all men, leaving nothing to <span class="accented">fill up</span> (vers. 20-22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38, 39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, etc.). It is worthy of note that, unless it be in the Epistle to the Hebrews, St. Paul never uses the words "suffer," "suffering" (much less "affliction") in connection with the atoning sacrifice. He dwells rather on the objective fact itself - "the death," "the cross," "the blood." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The prevailing interpretation (Chrysostom, Augustine, down to Alford, Ellicott) finds here <span class="accented">the afflictions of the Church</span> (including Paul's) <span class="accented">made Christ's by mystic sympathy</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23, 29</a>). But this view identifies Paul's sufferings with his Master's, while he expressly distinguishes them; and the idea, however beautiful in itself, is without Pauline analogy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Meyer holds the afflictions to be <span class="accented">Paul's own afflictions which are Christ's by ethical identity, as</span> belonging to the same class. This approaches (1), but is less simple grammatically, and again confuses the <span class="accented">antithesis</span> involved in the pointed <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Other modifications of this view - <span class="accented">afflictions coming from Christ, on account of Christ</span>, etc. - are less plausible. Dr. Gloag, in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 7. pp. 224-236, fully discusses the passage and ably defends (3). <span class="cmt_word">In my flesh</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-5.htm">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13, 14</a>); for St. Paul's physical nature felt keenly the pangs of imprisonment, the chafing of "these bonds." And thus he puts honour on the despised <span class="accented">flesh</span>, as capable of such high service (see note, ver. 22)<span class="cmt_word">. On behalf of his body, which is the Church</span> (ver. 18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm">2 Timothy 2:10</a>). The interests of the Church demanded his sufferings. They are "for you" (Colossian Gentiles); but, in his view, the full possession of the gospel by the Gentiles and the existence of the Church itself were vitally bound up together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15, 21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). If "Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for her" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>), he might well in his turn suffer on the same account. The magnitude of the interests involved are measured by his greatness whose body the Church is (vers. 15-18).

Lightfoot explains well: "It signifies that the supply comes from an opposite quarter to the deficiency, and so describes the correspondence of the personal agents," and not merely the correspondence of the supply with the deficiency.<p>That which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Lacking, lit., behind.

Of the afflictions of Christ. The afflictions which Christ endured; which belonged to Him: not Paul's afflictions described as Christ's because endured in fellowship with Him (Meyer); nor the afflictions which Christ endures in His Church (Alford, Ellicott, Eadie).<p>These afflictions do not include Christ's vicarious sufferings, which are never denoted by &#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; tribulations. That which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ signifies that portion of Christ's ministerial sufferings which was not endured by Him in person, but is endured in the suffering of Christians in all generations in carrying out Christ's work. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-7.htm">2 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>. Hence those are mistaken interpretations which explain the filling up as a correspondence of the supply with the deficiency. The correspondence is between the two parties, Christ and His followers, and the supply does not correspond with the deficiency, but works toward supplying it. The point is not the identification of Paul with Christ in His sufferings (which is true as a fact), but the distinction between Paul and Christ. Hence the present tense, I am filling up, denoting something still in process. The full tale of sufferings will not be completed until the Church shall have finished her conflict, and shall have come up "out of great tribulation" to sit at the marriage-supper of the Lamb.<p>In my flesh<p>Connect with fill up.<p>For His body's sake, which is the Church<p>&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be; flesh is never used of a metaphorical organism like the Church, but &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; body.
