Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit - The love wrought in you by the Holy Spirit.

Not only their love to God, and Christ, and to all the saints, which is before mentioned, but their love to the apostle; though they had only heard of him, and of his great capacity for, and faithfulness and usefulness in preaching of the Gospel, which had greatly endeared him to them. This, he says, was in the Spirit; it was spiritual love, to distinguish it from a carnal and worldly one; they loved him for the spiritual grace that was in him, the spiritual gifts bestowed on him, the spiritual service he was engaged in, and the spiritual usefulness he was of: or they loved him in, and with their spirits, with all their hearts, sincerely, and without dissimulation; and though they had never seen him in the flesh, yet being, as it were, present with him in spirit, their affections were knit unto him: or this their love was "in the Holy Spirit", as the Ethiopic version reads it; it was a fruit of the Spirit of God, which he had implanted in their hearts in regeneration, as is also love to God, and likewise to Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Who also declared unto us your love in the <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> Spirit.</span><p>(2) He declares his good will towards them, telling them that they must not still remain at one place, but go on further both in the knowledge of the Gospel, and also in the true use of it.<p>(e) Your spiritual love, or your love which comes from the Spirit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-8.htm" title=" Who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.">Colossians 1:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὴν ὑμῶν ἀγάπην</span> may be taken in the general sense of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a>, though many think it is their love to Paul that is meant; and this is favoured by <span class="greekheb">δηλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡμ</span>., and perhaps by <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡμεῖς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν πνεύματι</span> is added to show that this love is in the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">also</span>] “As he preached to you from us, so <span class="ital">also</span> he brought back from us to you the tidings, etc.” (Lightfoot.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">your love</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a> above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the Spirit</span>] “In” Whom they were (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

Epaphras had conveyed the blessings of the gospel from St. Paul to the Colossians, and they now send back the grateful assurance of their love by the same channel (comp, note on "having heard," ver. 4, and parallel passages). This was a choice fruit of the gospel in them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-10.htm">Philippians 4:10, 15-18</a>), and such a reference to it gives a kindly conclusion to the thanksgiving. Ellicott and others understand here <span class="accented">brotherly love in general</span> - a somewhat pointless repetition of ver. 4. Meyer, reading "on your behalf" in ver. 7. more suitably suggests the Colossians' <span class="accented">love to Epaphras</span> in return for his services to them. The <span class="accented">Spirit</span> is the ruling element of the Colossians' love (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>) Love-in-the-Sprat forms a single compound phrase, like "faith-in-Christ-Jesus" (ver. 4).

"Spirit" occurs besides in this Epistle only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a> (but see "spiritual," ver. 9), and some find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1, 5</a> the explanation of this phrase (<span class="accented">sc.</span> "a love formed in absence, without personal intercourse:" but this is forced, and doubtful in point of grammar). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - The <span class="accented">opening prayer</span> rises out of the foregoing thanksgiving, and leads up to the chief doctrinal statement of the Epistle (vers. 15-20: compare, for the connection, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8-17</a>).
