The probable reading is, <span class= "ital">which is come unto you, just as in all the world it is now bringing forth fruit and growing, as also it does in you.</span> In this sentence there are two lessons implied. First, the universality of the gospel, in which it stands contrasted, as with all local and national religions, whether of Judaism or of Paganism, so also with the secret doctrines of Gnostic speculation, intelligible only to the initiated few. Next, the test of its reality both by practical fruit of action, and by the spiritual growth connected therewith. In relation to the former, “faith without works” is “dead”; in relation to the other it is “imperfect,” needing to be developed into maturity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-20.htm" title="But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?">James 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-22.htm" title="See you how faith worked with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?">James 2:22</a>). Both these lessons were evidently needed, in consequence of the appearance at Colossæ of the occult mysticism and the unpractical speculation noted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>. But the Church itself was still faithful. Hence the last words, “as also it does in you,” turning back again to Colossæ in particular, are an insertion of kindly courtesy—one of the insertions of apparent afterthought not unfrequent in St. Paul’s Epistles—intended to show that the implied warning is by no means a condemnation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-8 All true Christians are brethren one to another. Faithfulness runs through every character and relation of the Christian life. Faith, hope, and love, are the three principal graces in the Christian life, and proper matter for prayer and thanksgiving. The more we fix our hopes on the reward in the other world, the more free shall we be in doing good with our earthly treasure. It was treasured up for them, no enemy could deprive them of it. The gospel is the word of truth, and we may safely venture our souls upon it. And all who hear the word of the gospel, ought to bring forth the fruit of the gospel, obey it, and have their principles and lives formed according to it. Worldly love arises, either from views of interest or from likeness in manners; carnal love, from the appetite for pleasure. To these, something corrupt, selfish, and base always cleaves. But Christian love arises from the Holy Spirit, and is full of holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which is come unto you - It has not been confined to the Jews, or limited to the narrow country where it was first preached, but has been sent abroad to the Gentile world. The object of the apostle here seems to be, to excite in them a sense of gratitude that the gospel had been sent to them. It was owing entirely to the goodness of God in sending them the gospel, that they had this hope of eternal life.<p>As it is in all the world - It is confined to no place or people, but is designed to be a universal religion. It offers the same blessedness in heaven to all; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>.<p>And bringing forth fruit - The fruits of righteousness or good living; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>. The meaning is, that the gospel was not without effect wherever it was preached. The same results were observable everywhere else as in Colossae, that it produced most salutary influences on the hearts and lives of those who received it. On the nature of the "fruits" of religion, see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>.<p>Since the day ye heard of it - It has constantly been producing these fruits since you first heard it preached.<p>And knew the grace of God in truth - Since the time ye knew the true grace of God; since you became acquainted with the real benevolence which God has manifested in the gospel. The meaning is, that ever since they had heard the gospel it had been producing among them abundantly its appropriate fruit, and that the same thing had also characterized it wherever it had been dispensed. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

He speaks of the word as a living person present among them.<p>as it is in all the world&#8212;virtually, as it was by this time preached in the leading parts of the then known world; potentially, as Christ's command was that the Gospel should be preached to all nations, and not be limited, as the law was, to the Jews (Mt 13:38; 24:14; 28:19). However, the true reading, and that of the oldest manuscripts, is that which omits the following "and," thus (the "it is" of English Version is not in the original Greek): "As in all the world it is bringing forth fruit and growing (so the oldest manuscripts read; English Version omits 'and growing,' without good authority), even as it doth in you also." Then what is asserted is not that the Gospel has been preached in all the world, but that it is bearing fruits of righteousness, and (like a tree growing at the same time that it is bearing fruit) growing in numbers of its converts in, or throughout, all the world.<p>heard of it&#8212;rather, "heard it."<p>and knew&#8212;rather, "came to know"; became fully experimentally acquainted with.<p>the grace of God in truth&#8212;that is, in its truth, and with true knowledge [Alford].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; </span> and passing the narrow bounds of Judea, unto all or most of the regions of the world, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm" title=" If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;">Colossians 1:23</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-14.htm" title="And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness to all nations; and then shall the end come.">Matthew 24:14</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-5.htm" title="And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.">Acts 2:5</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm" title="First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.">Romans 1:8</a> 10:18</span>.

That is, the Gospel, which came to them from God, from heaven, from Christ, out of Jerusalem, from whence the word of the Lord was to come, by the ministers of the Gospel, who being sent, came to Colosse, and there preached it; and so the Syriac version renders the words , "which is preached unto you". And a wonderful instance of the free grace of God this was; they did not seek, inquire for, and go after the Gospel, but it came to them; and so Christ was found of them by it, who sought him not, and made manifest in his person, grace, and righteousness to them that asked not after him: for this Gospel came not to them in, word only, but with the power of the Holy Spirit: it was come, , "into you", as the phrase may be rendered, into their very hearts, and wrought effectually there, enlightening, convincing, comforting, and instructing them; where it had a place, and remained; for the words may be read, as they are by the Arabic version, "which is present with you". The Gospel is always in one place or another, and will be to the end of the world; but it is not always in the same place; but as yet it was not removed from Colosse; it was still with them in the external ministry of it, and it remained in their hearts in the powerful and comfortable experience of it: <p>as it is in all the world; as it was come into, and preached to all the world, and was made useful, and continued in all the world at that time. Christ gave his disciples a commission to go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature; it was no more to be restrained to a particular nation, but was made general and common to all the nations of the world, and accordingly they preached it to all; and by this time had delivered the joyful message to the greater part of the world, which is sometimes meant by all the world, and the whole world; or it had been now preached in all the known and habitable parts of the world by one apostle and another, some being sent into one part, and some into another; so that the grace of God appeared to all men, and the doctrine of it had been preached to every creature under the heaven, according to Christ's commission; the Gospel of the kingdom was to be preached in all the world, for a witness to all nations, before the end of the Jewish state came, or before the destruction of Jerusalem, which was not many years after the writing of this epistle. Now this shows, that it was the same Gospel which had been preached at Colosse by their faithful minister there, as had been preached in other areas, and in all parts of the world by the apostles; which is said in the commendation of the Gospel, it being one, uniform, consistent, and all of a piece in every place, and as preached by every faithful minister, and might serve greatly to confirm the Colossians in their faith of it: <p>and bringeth forth fruit: by which is meant, either the conversion of sinners, the fruit of the Gospel ministry, when attended with a divine blessing and power; or the graces of the Spirit, as faith, hope, love, repentance, humility, self-denial, &amp;c. with all the effects thereof, in new obedience, and a godly conversation, which come from Christ, the green fir tree, and are produced by the Spirit, through the preaching of the Gospel. The Vulgate Latin adds, "and increaseth"; the Syriac version has the same; and it is so read in some Greek copies, as in the Alexandrian copy, two of Stephens's, and in the Complutensian edition; and may intend the spread of the Gospel among others, besides those who first received it, and the growing fruitfulness of the professors of it under its influence: <p>as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it; as soon as ever it came among them they hearkened to it, they were inclined to hear it externally, and a divine power going along with it, giving them hearing ears, and understanding hearts, they heard it, so as to know it, love it, and believe it; and from that time it brought forth fruit, and increased in them, and they continued in the faith and profession of it; so that as the Gospel is commended both from the large spread and efficacy of it, as well as its uniformity in every place, these Colossians also are commended for their hearing of it, both externally and internally, and for their perseverance in it: and which is further illustrated in the following clause, <p>and knew the grace of God in truth: by "the grace of God" may be meant the love and favour of God, in the mission and gift of his Son, to be the Saviour and Redeemer of lost sinners, displayed in the Gospel, of which they had a comfortable experience, it being shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit; or the blessings of grace revealed in the Gospel, as free justification by the righteousness of Christ, full pardon of sin, according to the riches of grace, and adoption of children, arising out of the love and free favour of God, of which they had had a real application made to them through the Gospel, by the Spirit of God; or rather the doctrine of grace itself, so called because it is a declaration of the free grace of God in the salvation of sinners and the means of implanting grace in the heart. This they knew not merely in a notional and speculative manner, but experimentally; for the Gospel was not only come to them, but into them; they had a spiritual knowledge of it, and affection for it; they felt the power of it in their hearts, and tasted and relished the sweetness of it; and owned and "acknowledged" it, as the word here used may be rendered; for as with the heart they believed it so with the mouth they made public profession of it: and this they did "in truth"; they came by the knowledge of the love of God, and the blessings of grace, and the doctrines of it, by the Gospel, the word of truth; in and through that they became acquainted with these things; and having known and embraced the doctrine of the Gospel of the grace of God, in the truth of it, without any mixture of error, as it had been purely, and without adulteration, truly and faithfully preached by their minister, they professed it truly heartily, and sincerely, and without hypocrisy; which is another part of their commendation, and involves in it the praise of their minister also, which is enlarged upon in the following verses. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm" title=" Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:">Colossians 1:6</a>.

This word of the truth has been defined as the Gospel, but Paul now proceeds to indicate more precisely what he means by this term. It is that Gospel which they have already received, not the local perversion of it that has recently been urged on their notice, but that which is spreading in the whole world, its truth authenticated by its ever-widening area and deepening influence on its adherents, and which manifests the same inherent energy among the Colossians themselves, in the form in which they learnt it from their teacher Epaphras.—<span class="greekheb">καθὼς καὶ ἐν παντὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span>. According to the <span class="ital">TR.</span> <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔστι</span>, two statements are made—that the Gospel is present with the Colossians as it is present in all the world, and that it is bearing fruit and increasing as it is among the Colossians. The omission of <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἐστὶν καρ</span>. creates a little awkwardness, since <span class="greekheb">καθὼς καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν</span> seems then superfluous. Lightfoot takes <span class="greekheb">ἐστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καρ</span>. together as a periphrasis for <span class="greekheb">καρποφορεῖται</span>, but this construction is very rare in Paul. The symmetry of clauses is much better preserved if, with Soden and Haupt, we write <span class="greekheb">ἔστιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καρ</span>.

The former of these participles expresses the inward energy of the Gospel (dynamic middle) in its adherents, the latter its extension in the world by gathering in new converts.—<span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἧς ἡμέρας</span>. This expresses the further fact that the progress of the Gospel has been continuous from the first in the Colossian Church.—<span class="greekheb">ἠκούσατε</span> … <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>. It is uncertain whether <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span> is governed by both verbs (so Lightf., Kl[3], Ol., Sod., Abb.) or by the latter only (so Mey., Ell., Haupt). In the former case <span class="greekheb">ἠκούς</span>. will mean “were instructed in”. But it is simpler to translate “ye heard it [<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the Gospel] and knew the grace of God”, <span class="greekheb">ἐπέγνωτε</span> should strictly imply full knowledge, but as the reference is to the time of their conversion it seems doubtful whether this shade of meaning should be pressed. <span class="greekheb">ἐπίγνωσις</span> is in his mind. The word occurs twice in the context. The grace of God is probably mentioned in opposition to the false teachers doctrine of ordinances and rigorous asceticism.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀληθείᾳ</span>: not to be taken as if an adjective with <span class="greekheb">χάριν</span>, “the true grace of God,” for there is no false grace of God, but with <span class="greekheb">ἐπεγ</span>. in the sense that they knew the Gospel as it truly is, in its genuine reality, in opposition to the travesty of it recently introduced.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3] Klöpper.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">is come unto you</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">is present to you;</span>” but the A.V. and R.V. are idiomatically right.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth</span>, &c.] The word “<span class="ital">and</span>” here is textually doubtful; the adverse evidence though not decisive is considerable.

The noble and beautiful fact is thus given us that the Gospel’s fruit-bearing does not exhaust its source but rather developes the outcome. Transferring the imagery from the Gospel to its believing recipients, we gather that the more freely the Christian yields, as it were, his soul and his life to the fruitful energy of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm" title="But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,">Galatians 5:22</a>) the stronger will he become for always ampler production.

The words, "and increasing," are added to the text on the testimony, all but unanimous, of the older witnesses. Their propriety is manifest; for the success of the gospel at Colossae was a gratifying evidence, both of its inherent fruitfulness, and of its rapid progress in the Gentile world. Stationary at Rome (see Introduction, &sect; 3), and with his messengers coming and going, and news reaching him from time to time of the advance of the Christian cause, the strong expression, "in all the world," is natural to St. Paul. From Rome "all the world" is surveyed, just as what takes place at Rome seems to resound "in all the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). <span class="accented">Bearing fruit</span> (verb in middle voice, implying inherent energy) precedes <span class="accented">growing - the</span> first "describing the inner working," the second" the outward extension of the gospel" (Lightfoot). For "bearing fruit," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-11.htm">Philippians 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8, 16</a>: and for "growing," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-31.htm">Matthew 13:31-33</a>; and parallel passages; see also ver. 11. In the last clause the expression "doubles back upon itself" in a fashion characteristic of St. Paul, whose sentences grow and change their form like living things while he indites them (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a>, R.V.): the coming of the gospel to Colossae suggests the thought of its advent in the world, and this gives place to the fuller idea of its fruitfulness and expansion, which in turn is evidenced by its effect at Colossae. <span class="cmt_word">Since the day that ye heard (it), and knew well the grace of God in truth</span> (ver. 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-21.htm">Ephesians 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1, 2, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-14.htm">2 Timothy 3:14</a>). For their progress had been continuous (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>). Meyer and Ellicott, with the A.V., better maintain the connection of thought in understanding "the gospel" as object of "heard." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">knew well</span>, with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 9, etc.), belongs specially to the vocabulary of this group of Epistles. <span class="accented">Knowledge</span>, in 1 Corinthians, is denoted by the simple <span class="accented">gnosis.</span> But this word became at an early time the watchword of the heretical <span class="accented">Gnostics</span> (" men of knowledge:" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>); and the false teachers of Colossae pretended to an intellectual superiority, asserted, we may imagine, in much the same way (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2-4, 8, 23</a>). The apostle now prefers the more precise and distinctive <span class="accented">epignosis</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>), meaning" accurate" or" advanced knowledge" (see Lightfoot here, and on ver. 9). "To hear the gospel" is "to know well the grace of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20 - 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>); the <span class="accented">full knowledge</span> of which "in truth" (ver. 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14, 15, 20-24</a>) would preserve the Colossians from knowledge falsely so called. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Which is come unto you (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., which is present unto you.

The text varies. The best texts omit and. Some join &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; is with the previous clause, as it is in all the world, and take bearing fruit as a parallel participle. So Rev. Others, better, join is with the participle, "even as it is bearing fruit." This would emphasize the continuous fruitfulness of the Gospel. The middle voice of the verb, of which this is the sole instance, marks the fruitfulness of the Gospel by its own inherent power. Compare the active voice in <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>, and see <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/4-28.htm">Mark 4:28</a>, "the earth bringeth forth fruit &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7; of herself, self-acting.
