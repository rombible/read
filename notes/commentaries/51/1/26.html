But He suffered for the redemption of the church; we suffer on other accounts; for we do but slightly taste that cup of afflictions of which Christ first drank deeply. A Christian may be said to fill up that which remains of the sufferings of Christ, when he takes up his cross, and after the pattern of Christ, bears patiently the afflictions God allots to him. Let us be thankful that God has made known to us mysteries hidden from ages and generations, and has showed the riches of his glory among us. As Christ is preached among us, let us seriously inquire, whether he dwells and reigns in us; for this alone can warrant our assured hope of his glory. We must be faithful to death, through all trials, that we may receive the crown of life, and obtain the end of our faith, the salvation of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even the mystery - To make that mystery fully known.

This is said, as explanative of the word of God; signifying that he did not mean the Scriptures in general, which are the word of God, and every part of them; some part of which is historical, another prophetical, another practical, and another doctrinal; nor the law, which also is the word of God, but the Gospel, called "the mystery", as it often is; because it contains things, which, though revealed, are mysteries to a natural man; and even to enlightened persons, who have the clearest view of them, the "modus" of them is not to be accounted for; such as the doctrines of the Trinity, of the union of the two natures in Christ, the incarnation of the Son of God, the union and communion of the church with Christ, the resurrection of the dead, &amp;c. And though perhaps great and special regard may be here had to the calling of the Gentiles, which, though revealed in the prophecies of the Old Testament, was in a great measure hid in them, and not so clearly known in ages and generations past as now, yet the whole may be applied to the Gospel mystery in general; which was first hid in the heart of God, in his thoughts and purposes, in his counsel and covenant, and in his Son, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; and then in the ceremonies and shadows of the law, which but few had any insight into, and discerning of; and, during that dispensation, was wholly hid from the Gentiles; and but in part known by the Jews, and but by a few, and comparatively by them very darkly; and not so clearly by the angels themselves, who pry into these mysteries, and now, under the Gospel dispensation, learn from the church the manifold wisdom of God; and indeed it was hidden from all men, Jews and Gentiles, in a state of nature, and even from the wise and prudent of this world: <p>but now is made manifest to his saints; now under the Gospel dispensation, since the coming of Christ; there is an external revelation of the Gospel by him, more clearly, by whom grace and truth came, called the revelation of Christ; and an internal revelation of it by his Spirit, who is the spirit of wisdom and revelation, in the knowledge of him; which is made to saints, the holy apostles and prophets, who are the saints to whom this faith, and the mystery of it, were first delivered with so much power and evidence; and to all the elect of God, whom he has separated for himself in eternal election; whom Christ has sanctified by his blood, and to whom he is made sanctification; and who are called with an holy calling, have principles of grace and holiness wrought in them by the Spirit of God, and therefore called "his" saints; these have only a spiritual discerning of the Gospel, for the natural man neither knows nor receives it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>Even</i> the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> saints:</span><p>(t) Whom he chose to sanctify to himself in Christ.

How great the honour conferred on Paul is, appears from the fact that he is entrusted with the duty of declaring the long concealed secret which is the distinguishing mark of his Gospel.—<span class="greekheb">τὸμυ μυστήριον</span>. Lightfoot thinks that the term is borrowed by Paul from the Greek mysteries, and that it is intentionally chosen to point the contrast between those secret mysteries and the Gospel which is offered to all. But for the mysteries the plural was employed. And there would be more justification for this Interpretation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm" title="He answered and said to them, Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.">Matthew 13:11</a> = <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-10.htm" title="And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.">Luke 8:10</a>, where the disciples are told by Jesus that to them it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom, but not to others. But it will not be seriously supposed that Christ borrowed the term from the Greek mysteries. A mystery is a truth which man cannot know by his natural powers, so that if it is known it must be revealed.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ἀποκεκρυμμένον ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν γενεῶν</span>. Usually <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ</span> is taken as temporal, and this agrees with the fact that similar references in Paul are temporal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>), and with the use of <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ</span> as in <span class="greekheb">ἀπʼ αἰῶνος</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm" title="Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:">Matthew 25:34</a>). <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ καταβολῆς</span> occurs with <span class="greekheb">κρύπτω</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-35.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.">Matthew 13:35</a>). But elsewhere <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ</span> after <span class="greekheb">κρύπτω</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἀποκρύπτω</span>) indicates those from whom a thing is concealed. In favour of this meaning here is the order, for if <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αἰ</span>. were temporal <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τ γεν</span>. would be included as a matter of course. It has been so taken here, not by Klöpper, who suggests it as possible, but does not accept it, but by Franke. He thinks both are terms for angels, and in itself such a reference is not improbable, for it is through the Church that the principalities and powers come to learn the manifold wisdom of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm" title="And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:">Ephesians 3:9</a>, where just before the mystery is said to have been concealed <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων</span>). But we have no evidence that <span class="greekheb">γενεαί</span> was ever used in this way, and no parallel for this use of <span class="greekheb">αἰῶνες</span> in N.T. Without identifying the terms with personal existences, we may with Haupt (<span class="ital">cf.</span> also Soden) take <span class="greekheb">αἰῶνες</span> of the ages before the world, and <span class="greekheb">γενεαί</span> of the generations of human history. This will be practically the same as saying that the mystery was concealed from angels and men. This is probably the meaning of Bengel’s note: “Aeones referuntur ad angelos; generationes, ad homines”. Theodoret, followed by Klöpper, thinks that there is a polemical reference here to the antiquity of the Gospel and its consequent superiority to the Law. Abbott thinks the point of the reference to the long concealment and recent disclosure is that the acceptance of the false teaching is thus explained. But the non-polemical character of parallel passages makes these suggestions very uncertain.—<span class="greekheb">νῦν δὲ ἐφανερώθη</span>. The construction here changes, and the perfect participle is continued by the aorist indicative (Winer-Moulton, p. 717). The anacoluthon is caused by Paul’s intense joy that the long silence has been broken; he is content with nothing short of a definite statement of the glorious fact <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span> is equally appropriate whether <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ</span> is temporal or not, for the antithesis of past and present lies in the nature of the case.—<span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἁγίοις αὐτοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to Christians generally, not to the Jewish Christians (Hofm.), who certainly were not specially enlightened on this matter, nor the Apostles and prophets of the New Covenant, even though in the parallel <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm" title="Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;">Ephesians 3:5</a> they are chosen for mention, nor the angels, in spite of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>.

See our note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a>. We have this “secret” unveiled and described just below. Lightfoot points out that the Greek word <span class="ital">mustêrion, “mystery</span>,” is “not the only term borrowed from the ancient mysteries [rites of special and secret initiation, lying, in a sense, apart from and behind the popular heathen worship] which St Paul employs to describe the teaching of the Gospel.” He gives instances from <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a> below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-12.htm" title="I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.">Php 4:12</a>, and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>. “There is this difference however, that whereas the heathen mysteries were strictly confined to a narrow circle, the Christian mysteries are freely communicated to all.

The word "mystery" plays a large part in Colossians and Ephesians. It occurs in 1 Corinthians, and twice in the Roman Epistle, written from Corinth. Its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a> is identical with that of the passage before us. The Greek <span class="accented">mysteries</span> were secret religious doctrines and rites made known only to initiated persons, who formed associations statedly assembling at certain sacred spots, of which Eleusis near Athens was the most famous. These systems exercised a vast influence over the Greek mind, and Greek literature is full of allusions to them; but their secret has been well kept, and little is known of their real character. Some of these mystic systems, probably, inculcated doctrines of a purer and more spiritual type than those of the vulgar polytheism. The ascetic and mystical doctrines ascribed to Pythagoras were propagated by secret societies. The language and ideas connected with the mysteries were readily adopted by the Jewish Broad Church of Alexandria, whose endeavour it was to expand Judaism by a symbolical and allegorizing method into a philosophic and universal religious system, and who were compelled to veil their inner doctrine from the eyes of their stricter, unenlightened (or unsophisticated) fellowbelievers. <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> appears in the Apocrypha as an epithet of the Divine Wisdom (Wisd. 2:22 Wisd. 8:4; etc.): <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-34.htm">Matthew 13:34, 35</a>) furnished the Old Testament basis of this usage. (See Philo, 'On the Cherubim,' &sect; 12; 'On Fugitives,' &sect; 16; etc., for the place <span class="accented">of mystery</span> in the Alexandrine theology.) St. Paul, writing to men accustomed, either as Greeks or as Hellenistic Jews, to this phraseology, calls the gospel <span class="accented">"a</span> mystery," as that which <span class="accented">is "hidden</span> from the natural understanding and from the previous searchings of men" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a>). But in the words that follow he repudiates the notion of any secrecy or exclusiveness in its proclamation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12-4:6</a>); in his language, "mystery is the correlate of revelation." The thrice-repeated <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> ("from," "away"), with the double indication of time, "gives a solemn emphasis" (Meyer) to the statement. <span class="accented">Ages</span> are successive epochs of time, with their states and conditions (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>); <span class="accented">generations</span> are successive races of men, with their traditions and hereditary tendencies. But now it was made manifest to his saints (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>). The word "reveal" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>) indicates a process, "make manifest" points to the result of this Divine act (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> with Romans 3:21; see Trench's 'Synonyms'). The transition from the participle in the last clause to the strongly assertive finite verb in this almost disappears in English idiom: comp. vers. 5, 6; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a> (Greek); and see Winer's 'N.T. Grammar,' p. 717, or A. Buttmann, p. 382. There is also a change of tense: the manifestation is a single, sudden event (aorist), breaking through the long and seemingly final concealment of all previous time (present perfect participle); similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25, 26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>, note). <span class="accented">To his sailors</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the Church at large (ver. 2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>); but this implies a spiritual qualification (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>). "His saints" are the recipients; "his <span class="accented">holy</span> apostles and prophets, in the Spirit," the organs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>) of this manifestation. The Church had long ago formally accepted this revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-18.htm">Acts 11:18</a>); it was St. Paul's office to make it practically effectual. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The mystery<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>.

In the New Testament the word implies something which, while it may be obscure in its nature, or kept hidden in the past, is now revealed. Hence used very commonly with words denoting revelation or knowledge. So, "to know the mysteries," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11</a>; "revelation of the mystery," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; made known, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>, etc. In Colossians and Ephesians it is used, with a single exception, of the admission of the Gentiles to gospel privileges.

The preposition &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; from, differs from &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769; before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>), as marking the point from which concealment could properly begin. Before the beginning of the ages of the world the counsel of God was ordained, but not concealed, because there were no human beings from whom to conceal it. The concealment began from the beginning of the world, with the entrance of subjects to whom it could be a fact. </body></html>
