The prayer is for their full and perfect knowledge of God’s will; but this is emphatically connected with practical “walking” in that will, first by fruitfulness in good work, next by showing themselves strong in Christ to endure sufferings, lastly by thankful acceptance of God’s call to inheritance among the saints in light. There is a hearty recognition of the blessing of knowledge (on which the incipient Gnosticism of the day was so eloquent); but it is to be tried by the three tests of practical goodness, patience, and thankful humility.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">Do not cease to pray for you.</span>—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-16.htm" title="Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;">Ephesians 1:16</a>. “To pray” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-18.htm" title="Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;">Ephesians 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm" title="Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.">Philippians 4:6</a>) is the general word for “to worship”; “to desire” indicates prayer, properly so called, asking from God what is requisite and necessary for ourselves or for others.<p><span class= "bld">The knowledge of his will.</span>—The “knowledge” here spoken of is the “full knowledge,” to be attained in measure here, to be made perfect in heaven. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a>, “Now I know in part; but then shall I know (perfectly) even as I am known.” On this word, especially frequent in the Epistles of the captivity, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>. It should be noted that the knowledge here prayed for is “the knowledge <span class= "ital">of God’s will”</span>—not speculation as to the nature of God, or as to emanations from Deity, or even as to the reasons of God’s mysterious counsels, but knowledge of what actually is His will, both in the dispensation which is to be accepted in faith, and in the commandments to be obeyed in love. So St. Paul (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.">1Timothy 1:4-5</a>) contrasts with the “fables and endless genealogies” of Gnostic speculation, “the end of the commandment,” “charity out of a pure heart and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned.”<p><span class= "bld">In all wisdom and spiritual understanding.</span>—This “knowledge of God’s will” is man’s “wisdom.” For “wisdom” is the knowledge of the true end of life; which is (as the Book of Ecclesiastes so tragically shows) vainly sought, if contemplated apart from God’s will, but found (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm" title="Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm" title="And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.">Job 28:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-7.htm" title="The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.">Proverbs 1:7</a>) in the “fear of the Lord” and the “keeping of His commandments.” (On the relation of the supreme gift of wisdom to lesser cognate gifts, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm" title="Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;">Ephesians 1:8</a>.) “Understanding” here is properly the faculty of spiritual insight or judgment, the speculative exercise of wisdom, as the “prudence” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm" title="Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;">Ephesians 1:8</a> is the practical. Hence St. Paul subjoins the practical element at once in the next verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/colossians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;...">Colossians 1:9-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">For this cause </span>— The report of your faith and love; <span class="ital">we do not cease to pray for you — </span>We fail not to remember you in all our prayers.

The apostle mentions next four particulars included in this walking worthy of the Lord. 1st, The <span class="ital">being fruitful in every good work </span>— Or embracing all opportunities of doing good to the bodies and souls of men, according to our ability, and thus showing our faith continually by our works, and our love by our obedience, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?...">James 2:14-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-17.htm" title="But whoever has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?">1 John 3:17</a>. And, 2d, <span class="ital">Increasing in the knowledge </span>— The experimental practical knowledge; <span class="ital">of God </span>— That is, while we are diligent in performing good works outwardly, taking care that we increase in vital religion inwardly, even in a participation of the divine nature, and a conformity to the divine image. 3d, Receiving and bearing with <span class="ital">patience, long-suffering, and joyfulness </span>— All the sufferings which come upon us in the course of divine providence: in other words, that we sustain, with entire resignation to, and acquiescence in, the divine will, and with a calm and tranquil mind, all the chastisements of our heavenly Father, knowing they are for our profit; and all the trials by which it is his will our faith and other graces should be exercised, and all the purifying fires through which he is pleased to lead us; that we patiently bear with the infirmities, failings, and faults of our fellow-creatures, saints or sinners, and receive even their injuries and provocations without resentment; and that in the midst of all these apparent evils, we rejoice on account of the present blessings we possess, and especially in the knowledge we have that all these, and such like things, however afflictive to flesh and blood, shall infallibly <span class="ital">work together for our good, </span>while we <span class="ital">love God. </span>Well might the apostle signify, that, in order to all this, we need to be <span class="ital">strengthened with </span>all <span class="ital">might, </span>or very mightily strengthened, according to God’s glorious power, always ready to be exerted in behalf of his suffering people. The fourth particular mentioned by the apostle, as included in walking worthy of the Lord, is continual gratitude for the blessings enumerated in the three next verses; blessings which whosoever enjoys, has unspeakable reason for thankfulness, whatever his state or condition may be as to the present world.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-14 The apostle was constant in prayer, that the believers might be filled with the knowledge of God's will, in all wisdom. Good words will not do without good works. He who undertakes to give strength to his people, is a God of power, and of glorious power. The blessed Spirit is the author of this. In praying for spiritual strength, we are not straitened, or confined in the promises, and should not be so in our hopes and desires. The grace of God in the hearts of believers is the power of God; and there is glory in this power. The special use of this strength was for sufferings. There is work to be done, even when we are suffering. Amidst all their trials they gave thanks to the Father of our Lord Jesus, whose special grace fitted them to partake of the inheritance provided for the saints. To bring about this change, those were made willing subjects of Christ, who were slaves of Satan. All who are designed for heaven hereafter, are prepared for heaven now. Those who have the inheritance of sons, have the education of sons, and the disposition of sons. By faith in Christ they enjoyed this redemption, as the purchase of his atoning blood, whereby forgiveness of sins, and all other spiritual blessings were bestowed. Surely then we shall deem it a favour to be delivered from Satan's kingdom and brought into that of Christ, knowing that all trials will soon end, and that every believer will be found among those who come out of great tribulation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Do not cease to pray for you - <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3</a>. The progress which they had already made, and the love which they had shown, constituted an encouragement for prayer, and a reason why higher blessings still should be sought. We always feel stimulated and encouraged to pray for those who are doing well.<p>That ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will - They had shown by their faith and love that they were disposed to do his will, and the apostle now prays that they might be fully acquainted with what he would have them do.

There seems to have been a want of knowledge among the Colossians; notwithstanding their general excellencies; hence he so often dwells on this subject (Col 1:28; Col 2:2, 3; 3:10, 13; 4:5, 6). On the contrary he less extols wisdom to the Corinthians, who were puffed up with the conceit of knowledge.<p>wisdom&#8212;often mentioned in this Epistle, as opposed to the (false) "philosophy" and "show of wisdom" (Col 2:8, 23; compare Eph 1:8).<p>understanding&#8212;sagacity to discern what on each occasion is suited to the place and the time; its seat is "the understanding" or intellect; wisdom is more general and has its seat in the whole compass of the faculties of the soul [Bengel].

Then never read them for mere knowledge sake" [Quoted by Gaussen.] Knowledge is desirable only when seasoned by "spiritual understanding."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For this cause we also; </span> he doth here suggest the motive mentioned in the precedent verses, viz. their faith and love, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a>,5</span>, and their special love to him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-8.htm" title=" Who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.">Colossians 1:8</a></span>, why he and his brethren had them so much upon their hearts: <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-15.htm" title="Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,...">Ephesians 1:15-17</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you:</span> it seems, from the time they were refreshed with these things they did (as he exhorts the Colossians here, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-2.htm" title=" Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;">Colossians 4:2</a></span>) always upon all solemn occasions wait upon God for the Colossians’ spiritual prosperity, as Paul himself did for the Philippians: <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-1.htm" title="And he spoke a parable to them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;">Luke 18:1</a>"</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-12.htm" title="Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;">Romans 12:12</a>"</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-4.htm" title="Always in every prayer of my for you all making request with joy,">Philippians 1:4</a>"</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm" title="And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;">Philippians 1:9</a>"</span>. <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm" title="Pray without ceasing.">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>"</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will; </span> and the subject matter of their instant prayer was, that they might attain to a more distinct, clear, and practical knowledge of the mind of God in Christ, and a greater measure of conformity to what he requires in the gospel, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm" title=" Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:">Colossians 1:6</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-15.htm" title="See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,...">Ephesians 5:15-17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In all wisdom; </span> in (rather than with) all necessary knowledge of the things of faith and manners, according to the prescript of the gospel: for sapience or wisdom doth properly respect the most excellent things, and such we learn most distinctly and satisfactorily from the revealed will of God, which we have in the Bible: this is that which Paul and other holy men spoke as taught of God amongst the perfect or grown Christians, in opposition both to the wisdom of man and of the world, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>,6</span>, being agreeable to the will of God, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm" title="And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.">Job 28:28</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-7.htm" title="Whoever keeps the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shames his father.">Proverbs 28:7</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm" title="And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:40</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm" title="For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a></span>.

Not merely for their love to the apostle, and the rest that were with him; which sense is too much contracted, and carries some appearance of meanness and selfishness; but because of their faith in Christ, their love to all the saints, and the good hope they had of eternal happiness; and because they had heard the Gospel, and truly knew it, and sincerely professed it: therefore, <p>since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire; which shows that the apostles prayed without ceasing; not that they were every moment praying, without intermission, but that they were frequent and constant every day at the throne of grace; and as often as they were there, they were mindful of these Colossians, even ever since they heard of their reception of the Gospel, of their profession of it, and of the fruit it brought forth in them; and in their petitions "prayed" and "desired", earnestly and importunately entreated God on their behalf: <p>that ye might he filled with the knowledge of his will; the will "of God", as the Syriac version reads it, by which is meant, not the secret will of God, according to the counsel of which he does all things in nature, providence, and grace, but his revealed will; and that either as it is signified in the law, which declares the good, and perfect, and acceptable will of God, relating to what he would have done, or avoided by his creatures; or rather, as it is exhibited in the Gospel, which contains the will of God respecting the salvation of his chosen ones; as that it is his will that Christ should obtain eternal redemption for them, to do which he voluntarily substituted himself in their room, came into this world, and has accomplished it; and that all those that are redeemed by Christ should be regenerated by the Spirit; and that whoever sees the Son, and believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life; as also, that all those whom he has chosen in Christ, and given to him, and he has redeemed by his blood, and who are sanctified by his Spirit, none of them should be lost, but that they should be all saved with an everlasting salvation. Now the apostle does, not pray that they might have a "knowledge" of this will of God, for some knowledge of it they had already; they had heard of the hope laid up in heaven, in the truth of the word of the Gospel; they had not only had the external, revelation, and had heard the Gospel outwardly preached, but they had known truly the grace of God; and therefore what he asks for is, that they might be "filled" with the knowledge of it; which supposes that they had knowledge, but it was not full and complete; it was imperfect, as is the knowledge of the best of saints in this life; and that they might have a larger measure of it, and such a fulness of it as they were capable of in the present state, and not such an one as the saints will have in heaven, when they shall know even as they are known. He adds, <p>in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; his meaning is, that they might be led into all the wisdom of God, which is so largely displayed in the revelation of his will concerning the salvation of his people, which is made in the Gospel; which is the manifold wisdom of God, wherein he has abounded in all wisdom and prudence; and contains such a scheme of things, so wisely contrived and formed, that angels desire to look into it; and that they might have a "spiritual understanding" of the mysteries of grace, without which they cannot be discerned to spiritual advantage, nor indeed without the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of them: and the Ethiopic version renders it, by "the prudence of the Holy Ghost": who searches the deep things of God, and reveals them to the saints, and improves and increases their spiritual and experimental knowledge of them, which is what is here intended. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For this cause we also, since the day we heard <i>it</i>, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</span><p>(f) God's will.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>. <span class="ital">Intercession</span>, down to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm" title=" Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:">Colossians 1:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο</span>] on account of all that has been said from <span class="greekheb">ἀκούσαντες</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a> onward: <span class="ital">induced</span> thereby, <span class="ital">we also cease not</span>, etc. This reference is required by <span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἧς ἡμέρας ἠκούσαμεν</span>, which cannot correspond to the <span class="greekheb">δηλώσας ἡμῖν</span>, belonging as that does merely to an accessory thought, but must take up again (in opposition to Bleek and Hofmann) the <span class="greekheb">ἀκούσαντες</span> which was said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a>.

Guyon, on this verse (<span class="ital">La Sainte Bible</span>) writes characteristically and truly: “All perfection consists in doing the will of God … the works which seem greatest are nothing if they are not in the will of God.… The more the soul does the will of God in all things, the more it knows God.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[79] See the hymn beginning, <span class="ital">Liebwerther</span>, <span class="ital">süsser Gottes-Wille</span>, in Tersteegen’s <span class="ital">Blumengârtlein</span>; translated in <span class="ital">Hymns of Consecration and Faith</span>, No. 257.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">spiritual</span>] As due to the gift and teaching of <span class="ital">the Spirit</span>.
