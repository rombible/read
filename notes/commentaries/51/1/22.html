The meaning is, of course, His natural body, as distinguished from His mystic Body, spoken of above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>). But this is no sufficient reason for the use of this phrase, for there could be no confusion between them in this passage. Hence, without ascribing to the word “flesh” a distinctly polemical intention, we may not unnaturally suppose that there was present to St. Paul’s mind the thought of the Gnosticism, which depreciated the body as evil, and which must have always inclined to the idea that “Jesus Christ had not come in the flesh” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1John 4:2-3</a>); and that the presence of this thought induced some special emphasis in his language.<p><span class= "bld">Holy and unblameable and unreproveable.</span>—See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm" title="According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:">Ephesians 1:4</a>. The word “to present” is used both in a sacrificial sense (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>) and in the sense of introduction and presentation (as of a bride, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>). The words, “holy and unblameable,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>“without blemish,” suit the former sense. But “unreproveable” is incongruous with it, and the parallel passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>) speaks of “access” or introduction to the Father.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 Christ in his human nature, is the visible discovery of the invisible God, and he that hath seen Him hath seen the Father. Let us adore these mysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the body of his flesh through death - The death of his body, or his death in making an atonement, has been the means of producing this reconciliation. It:<p>(1) removed the obstacles to reconciliation on the part of God - vindicating his truth and justice, and maintaining the principles of his government as much as if the sinner had himself suffered the penalty of the law - thus rendering it consistent for God to indulge the benevolence of his nature in pardoning sinners; and,<p>(2) it was the means of bringing the sinner himself to a willingness to be reconciled - furnishing the strongest possible appeal to him; leading him to reflect on the love of his Creator, and showing him his own guilt and danger. No means ever used to produce reconciliation between two alienated parties has had so much tenderness and power as those which God has adopted in the plan of salvation; and if the dying love of the Son of God fails to lead the sinner back to God, everything else will fail. The phrase "the body of his flesh" means, the body of flesh which he assumed in order to suffer in making an atonement. The reconciliation could not have been effected but by his assuming such a body, for his divine nature could not so suffer as to make atonement for sins.<p>To present you - That is, before God. The object of the atonement was to enable him to present the redeemed to God freed from sin, and made holy in his sight. The whole work had reference to the glories of that day when the Redeemer and the redeemed will stand before God, and he shall present them to his Father as completely recovered from the ruins of the fall.<p>Holy - Made holy, or made free from sin; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-36.htm">Luke 20:36</a>.<p>And unblameable - Not that in themselves they will not be deserving of blame, or will not be unworthy, but that they will be purified from their sins. The word used here - &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  amo&#772;mos - means, properly "spotless, without blemish;" see <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>, note.

Angels who have not a "body of flesh" are not in any way our reconciling mediators, as your false teachers assert, but He, the Lord of angels, who has taken our flesh, that in it He might atone for our fallen manhood.<p>through death&#8212;rather as Greek, "through His death" (which could only take place in a body like ours, of flesh, Heb 2:14). This implies He took on Him our true and entire manhood. Flesh is the sphere in which His human sufferings could have place (compare Col 1:24; Eph 2:15).<p>to present you&#8212;(Eph 5:27).

"Without blemish" (as the former Greek word is translated as to Jesus, our Head, 1Pe 1:19) in one's self. Irreproachable (the Greek for the second word, one who gives no occasion for his being brought to a law court) is in relation to the world without. Sanctification, as the fruit, is here treated of; justification, by Christ's reconciliation, as the tree, having preceded (Eph 1:4; 5:26, 27; Tit 2:14). At the same time, our sanctification is regarded here as perfect in Christ, into whom we are grafted at regeneration or conversion, and who is "made of God unto us (perfect) sanctification" (1Co 1:30; 1Pe 1:2; Jude 1): not merely progressive sanctification, which is the gradual development of the sanctification which Christ is made to the believer from the first.<p>in his sight&#8212;in God's sight, at Christ's appearing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the body of his flesh through death; </span> the means whereby their reconciliation to God was purchased, (which they had particularly applied by faith, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm" title=" Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,">Colossians 1:4</a></span>), was the sacrifice of that fleshy (not fantastical) body which Christ had assumed, subject to the condition of an animal life, being capable of suffering and mortal, (not refined and immortal, as after his resurrection, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm" title="For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.">Romans 5:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.

Or "through his death", as the Alexandrian copy and some others, and all the Oriental versions, read. These words express the means by which that reconciliation was made, which in the virtue and efficacy of it was applied particularly to these Colossians at their conversion whereby their minds were actually reconciled to God, as "in" or "by the body of his flesh"; that is, by the offering up of his body on the accursed tree, in which he bore the sins of his people, and made reconciliation for them: and it is so called either to distinguish it from his mystical and spiritual body the church, of which he is the head before spoken of; or from his glorious and immortal body, as now raised and exalted at God's right hand; and to denote the truth of his human body, that it was a real fleshly body, consisting of flesh and blood as ours does, and the same with ours, and not an aerial, celestial bony, or a mere phantom; and also to signify the infirmity and mortality of it, being, excepting sin, in all points like to ours, and subject to death; and that it was in that body his Father prepared for him, and he assumed; and as he was clothed with it in the days of his flesh, or mortal state, that he made reconciliation for the sins of his people, and that "through death" in it; even the death of the cross, by which he bore the penalty of the law, the curse of it, made satisfaction to justice, obtained life, abolished death, and destroyed him that had the power of it, and fixed a sure and lasting peace for all his saints; his end in which was, <p>to present you holy and unblamable, and unreproveable in his sight. This presentation of the saints by Christ is either in his own sight, "before himself", as the Arabic version reads it; and is here in this present state, they being considered by him both as sanctified and as justified; he taking delight in the graces of his Spirit, and the exercise of them on himself, though imperfect, and in them as clothed with his spotless righteousness, in which they are perfectly comely, all fair, and without spot: or in the latter day glory, the New Jerusalem church state; when the church will be as a bride prepared for her husband, will be brought into his presence in raiment of needlework, in fine linen clean and white, the righteousness of the saints, and be presented to himself a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; or in the ultimate glory, when all the saints shall be for ever with him, continually before him, and in his sight; which is what his heart was set upon from everlasting, which he had in view in his sufferings and death, and still has in his prayers and preparations: or else this presentation is what has been or will be made before his Father, and in his sight; and which was partly done, when he gathered together all the elect in himself, and represented them on the cross, in the body of his flesh; and partly is now doing in heaven, where he appears in the presence of God for them, bears their names on his breastplate, presents their persons and their cases; and especially will be done at the last day, when he will deliver up the kingdom to the Father, and say, lo, I and the children thou hast given me: and who will be presented "holy" by him; he being their sanctification, and they having all their sins expiated by his sacrifice, and their persons washed and cleansed in his blood, and their hearts sanctified by his Spirit; which sanctification though it is imperfect in this life, yet will be completed by the author of it at death; without perfect holiness no man shall see God, or be presented in his sight: and this is in consequence of the death of Christ and reconciliation by it and a fruit of electing grace, by which persons are chosen in Christ, that they should be holy and without blame; and as here, "unblamable and unreproveable": as they are, not now in themselves, but in Christ, as arrayed with his robe of righteousness and garments of salvation, being all glorious within, and their clothing of wrought gold, in which they will be introduced and presented to himself, and to his Father, faultless, with exceeding joy, and stand so before the throne, and that to all eternity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In the body of his <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:</span><p>(p) In that fleshly body, to show us that his body was not an unreal body, but a real one.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν τῷ σώματι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">that, by means of which</span> they have been reconciled; corresponding to the <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span> and <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ σταυροῦ αὐτοῦ</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a> : <span class="ital">in the body of His flesh by means of death</span>.

(2) Looking to the concrete presentation of the matter, and because the procuring element is subsequently brought forward specially and on its own account by <span class="greekheb">διά</span>, the <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is not, with Erasmus and many others, to be taken as <span class="ital">instrumental</span>, but is to be left as <span class="ital">local;</span> not, however, in <span class="ital">the</span> sense that Christ accomplished the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλάσσειν</span> <span class="ital">in</span> His body, which was fashioned materially like ours (Hofmann, comp. Calvin and others, including Bleek)—which, in fact, would amount to the perfectly self-evident point, that it took place in His corporeally-human form of being,—but, doubtless, especially as <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ θανάτου</span> follows, in <span class="ital">the</span> sense, that <span class="ital">in the body</span> of Christ, by means of the death therein accomplished, our reconciliation was objectively realized, which fact of salvation, therefore, <span class="ital">inseparably associated itself</span> with His body; comp. <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>, see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1 Peter 2:24</a> and Huther <span class="ital">in loc</span>.

(3) The reason for the <span class="ital">intentional</span> use of the <span class="ital">material</span> description: “in the body <span class="ital">which consisted of His flesh</span>” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/23-16.htm" title="Two sorts of men multiply sin, and the third will bring wrath: a hot mind is as a burning fire, it will never be quenched till it be consumed: a fornicator in the body of his flesh will never cease till he hath kindled a fire.">Sir 23:16</a>), is to be sought in the apologetic interest of antagonism to the <span class="ital">false teachers</span>, against whom, however, the charge of <span class="ital">Docetism</span>, possibly on the ground of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm" title=" Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.">Colossians 2:23</a>, can the less be proved (in opposition to Beza, Balduin, Böhmer, Steiger, Huther, and Dalmer), as Paul nowhere in the epistle expressly treats of the material <span class="ital">Incarnation</span>, which he would hardly have omitted to do in contrast to Docetism (comp. 1 John). In fact, the apostle found sufficient occasion for writing about the reconciliation as he has done here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>, in the <span class="ital">faith in angels</span> on the part of his opponents, by which they ascribed the reconciling mediation with God in part to those higher <span class="ital">spiritual</span> beings (who are without <span class="greekheb">σῶμα τῆς σαρκός</span>). Other writers have adopted the view, without any ground whatever in the connection, that Paul has thus written in order to distinguish the real body of Christ from the spiritual <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> of the <span class="ital">church</span> (Bengel, Michaelis, Storr, Olshausen).

With a significant emphasis, the material body of Christ is made the instrument of that reconciliation in the carrying out of which "his whole fulness" is engaged (vers. 19, 20); see note on "thought," ver. 21, and on "body," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>. The necessity of the double expression was shown by the fact that the Gnostic Marcion erased "of his flesh" from the text of this Epistle, and interpreted "the body" as "the Church;" Bengel and others suppose "of his flesh "to be added to prevent this mistake (see Tertullian, 'Against Marcion,' 5:19). This phrase was the crux of Docetism, whose principles were indeed implicitly contained in the Alexandrine-Jewish philosophy with its contempt for matter and the physical life, which was now first beginning to leaven the Church. <span class="accented">Body</span> is antithetical to <span class="accented">soul: flesh</span> to <span class="accented">spirit.</span> The former is individual and concrete, the actual physical organism; the latter denotes the material of which it consists, the bodily nature in its essence and characteristics (comp. note on ver. 11; and see Cremer's 'Lexicon' on these words). "In the body" is not "by the body," nor "during his earthly life" (as though opposed to "out of the body," <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-3.htm">2 Corinthians 12:3</a>), but "as incarnate." The Epistle to the Hebrews expands the thought of our Epistle in its own way in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>.

And the atoning death presupposes the Incarnation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>). The two foregoing phrases belong grammatically to ver. 21. To present you holy and without blemish and unreprovable before him (ver. 28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>); before "Christ" (ver. 19), who is "Judge" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22, 23</a>) as well as "King" and "Redeemer" (vers. 13, 14): this also belongs to his <span class="accented">fulness.</span> He will "himself present the Church to himself" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, Revised Text; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-14.htm">2 Corinthians 4:14</a>). In this <span class="accented">presentation</span> his redeeming work culminates (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>; and, in view of the connection of vers. 22 and 23, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-6.htm">1 Corinthians 1:6-9</a>). So, in general, Meyer and Alford. Ellicott and Lightfoot refer to <span class="accented">God's present approbations</span>, quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>, a parallel much less close than ver. 27, and supposing "God" the subject of the verb (see note on ver. 19). "Holy erga Deum; <span class="accented">without blemish</span> respectu vestri; <span class="accented">unreprovable</span> respectu proximi" (Bengel). (On "holy," see note, ver. 2; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>.) "Apropos is not "without blame," but "without blemish," "immaculate" (Lightfoot, R.V.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). In the LXX it is the equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="accented">tamim</span> ("integer"), "faultless" in bodily condition or in moral character. "Unreprovable," as a judicial term ("without charge that can be preferred"), points to the judgment day, and hence is wanting in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-8.htm">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33, 34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-10.htm">1 Timothy 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6, 7</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Body of His flesh<p>Which consisted of flesh; without which there could have been no death (see next clause).<p>To present (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Purpose of the reconciliation.

Unreprovable, not only actually free from blemish, but from the charge of it. See on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-8.htm">1 Corinthians 1:8</a>, and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-14.htm">1 Timothy 6:14</a>.<p>In His sight (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Rev., before Him. Him refers to God, not Christ. Whether the reference is to God's future judgment or to His present approval, can hardly be determined by the almost unexceptional usage of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; before, in the latter sense, as is unquestionably the case in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>. The simple &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; before, is used in the former sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-9.htm">Luke 12:9</a>. &#x395;&#787;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; before, occurs in both senses. The reference to the future judgment seems the more natural as marking the consummation of the redemptive work described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20-22</a>. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>, which corresponds with the figure of the bride, the Lamb's wife, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a> sqq. This view is further warranted by the following words, if ye continue, etc., the final presentation being dependent on steadfastness. </body></html>
