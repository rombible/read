(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-19.htm" title="Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;">Ephesians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>.) But still, as has been already noted, there is in this Epistle more stress on the supreme dignity of the Head, as in the other more on the unity, and blessing, and glory of the Body. It should be observed that in this, His mediatorial office, there is throughout a mysterious analogy to His eternal sonship. In both He is “the Head,” first, of universal creation, next, of the new creation in His Church; He is “the beginning,” in the one case in eternity, in the other in time; He is “the firstborn,” now in Eternal Sonship, now in the Resurrection making Him the new life of mankind.<p>(18) <span class= "bld">He is the head.</span>—“He” is again emphatic. “He who is the image of God, He also is the Head.” (On the title itself, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The beginning.</span>—Chrysostom reads here a kindred word, <span class= "ital">the first-fruits.</span> The reading is no doubt a gloss, but an instructive one.

In his sermon at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-33.htm" title="God has fulfilled the same to us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you.">Acts 13:33</a>), St. Paul quotes the passage, “Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee,” as fulfilled in that “He raised up Jesus again.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-5.htm" title="So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said to him, You are my Son, to day have I begotten you.">Hebrews 5:5</a>.) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>, he speaks of Christ as “declared” (or, <span class= "ital">defined</span>) “to be the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead.” The Resurrection is (so to speak) His second birth, the beginning of that exaltation, which is contrasted with His first birth on earth in great humility, and of His entrance on the glory of His mediatorial kingdom. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20-23</a>, where the starting-point of all His exaltation is again placed in the Resurrection.)<p><span class= "bld">That in all things he might . . .</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">That in all things He might become pre-eminent.</span> The words “He might become,” are opposed to the “He is” above.

Christ is called <span class="ital">the firstborn, from, </span>or <span class="ital">of, </span>(as <span class="greekheb">εκ </span>may be here rendered,) <span class="ital">the dead, </span>both because he was the first who ever rose to an immortal life, and because he is the Lord of all the dead, (as well as the living, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-9.htm" title="For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.">Romans 14:9</a>,) and will raise them at the last day. <span class="ital">That in all things </span>— Whether of nature or grace; <span class="ital">he might have the pre-eminence </span>— Suitable to the infinitely superior dignity of his nature above all created beings. <span class="ital">For it pleased the Father </span>— “The words, <span class="ital">the Father, </span>are not in the original; but they are very properly supplied by our translators.

Let us adore these mysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he is the head of the body, the church - Notes <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>, note.<p>Who is the beginning - In all things - alike in the work of creation and in the church.

This does not mean literally that he was the first who rose from the dead for he himself raised up Lazarus and others, and the bodies of saints arose at his crucifixion; but it means that he had the pre-eminence among them all; he was the most illustrious of those who will be raised from the dead, and is the head over them all. Especially, he had this pre-eminence in the resurrection in this respect, that he was the first who rose from death to immortality. Others who were raised undoubtedly died again. Christ rose to die no more; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>.<p>That in all things - Margin, "among all." The Greek will bear either construction, and either will accord with the scope of the apostle's remarks. If the former, it means that he is at the head of all things - the universe; if the latter, that he is chief among those who rose from the dead. Each of these is true, but the scope of the passage seems rather to require us to understand this of everything, and to mean that all the arrangements respecting him were such as to give him supremacy over the universe.<p>He might have the pre-eminence - Greek, "might be first" -  &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  pro&#772;teuo&#772;n.

Not angels in opposition to the false teachers' doctrine concerning angel-worship, and the power of Oeons or (imaginary) spirit emanations from God (Col 2:10, 18).<p>head of the body, the church&#8212;The Church is His body by virtue of His entering into communion corporeally with human nature [Neander], (Eph 1:22). The same One who is the Head of all things and beings by creation, is also, by virtue of being "the first-born from the dead," and so "the first-fruits" of the new creation among men, the Head of the Church.<p>who is&#8212;that is, in that He is the Beginning [Alford]. Rather, this is the beginning of a new paragraph. As the former paragraph, which related to His originating the physical creation, began with "Who is" (Col 1:15); so this, which treats of His originating the new creation, begins with "who is"; a parenthesis preceding, which closes the former paragraph, that parenthesis (see on [2403]Col 1:16), including from "all things were created by Him," to "Head of the body, the Church." The head of kings and high priests was anointed, as the seat of the faculties, the fountain of dignity, and original of all the members (according to Hebrew etymology). So Jesus by His unction was designated as the Head of the body, the Church.<p>the beginning&#8212;namely, of the new creation, as of the old (Pr 8:22; Joh 1:1; compare Re 1:8): the beginning of the Church of the first-born (Heb 12:23), as being Himself the "first-born from the dead" (Ac 26:23; 1Co 15:20, 23). Christ's primogeniture is threefold: (1) From eternity the "first-begotten" of the Father (Col 1:15); (2) As the first-born of His mother (Mt 1:25); (3) As the Head of the Church, mystically begotten of the Father, as it were to a new life, on the day of His resurrection, which is His "regeneration," even as His people's coming resurrection will be their "regeneration" (that is, the resurrection which was begun in the soul, extended to the body and to the whole creation, Ro 8:21, 22) (Mt 19:28; Ac 13:33; Re 1:5). Sonship and resurrection are similarly connected (Lu 20:36; Ro 1:4; 8:23; 1Jo 3:2). Christ by rising from the dead is the efficient cause (1Co 15:22), as having obtained the power, and the exemplary cause, as being the pattern (Mic 2:13; Ro 6:5; Php 3:21), of our resurrection: the resurrection of "the Head" involves consequentially that of the members.<p>that in all things&#8212;He resumes the "all things" (Col 1:20).<p>he might have the pre-eminence&#8212;Greek, "He Himself may (thus) become the One holding the first place," or, "take the precedency." Both ideas are included, priority in time and priority in dignity: now in the regenerated world, as before in the world of creation (Col 1:15).

(not <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ν</span>.) yields a form of conceiving the matter not materially different. Calvin takes <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκος ἐκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ν</span>. as specifying the ground for <span class="greekheb">ἀρχή</span>: “<span class="ital">principium</span> (absolutely), <span class="ital">quia primogenitus est ex mortuis;</span> nam in resurrectione est rerum omnium instauratio.” Against this it may be urged, that <span class="greekheb">ἀρχή</span> has no more precise definition; Paul must have written either <span class="greekheb">ἀρχὴ τῆς καινῆς κτίσεως</span>, or at least <span class="greekheb">ἧς</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span>. Calvin was likewise erroneously of opinion (comp. Erasmus, Calovius) that Christ is called <span class="ital">Primogenitus ex mortuis</span>, not merely because He was the first to rise, but also “<span class="ital">quia restituit aliis vitam</span>.” This idea is not conveyed either by the word or by the context, however true may be the thing itself; but a belief in the subsequent general resurrection of the dead is the <span class="ital">presupposition</span> of the expression <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκος</span> (<span class="greekheb">αἰνίττεται δὲ ὁ λόγος καὶ τὴν πάντων ἡμῶν ἀνάστασιν</span>, Theodoret). This expression is <span class="ital">purposely chosen</span> in significant reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>, as is intimated by Paul himself in the following <span class="greekheb">ἵνα γένηται ἐν πᾶσιν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. But it is thus all the more certain, that <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκος ἐκ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νεκρ</span>. is to be taken independently, and not adjectivally <span class="ital">together with</span> <span class="greekheb">ἀρχή</span> (Heinrichs, Schleiermacher, Ewald), which would only amount to a tautological verboseness (<span class="ital">first-born beginning</span>); and, on the other hand, that <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν</span> may not be separated from <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκος</span> in such a way as to emphasize the <span class="ital">place, issuing forth from which</span> Christ is what He is, namely, <span class="greekheb">ἀρχή</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκος</span>; <span class="ital">the former</span>, “as the personal beginning of what commences with Him;” <span class="ital">the latter</span>, “in the same relation to those who belong to the world therewith coming into life as He held to the creation” (Hofmann).

The <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν αὐτὸς πρωτεύει</span> is looked upon by Paul as something which is still in course of development (comp. Steiger and Huther), and is only to be completed in the future, namely, when the Risen One shall have conquered all the power of the enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a> f.) and have erected the kingdom of the Messiah—but of this result His resurrection itself was the necessary <span class="ital">historical basis</span>, and hence the future universal <span class="greekheb">πρωτεύειν</span> is the divinely intended <span class="ital">aim</span> of His being risen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν</span>] <span class="ital">in all points</span>, without excepting any relation, not, therefore, merely in the relation of creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:...">Colossians 1:15-17</a>).

The false teachers not only wrongly represented the relation of the angel powers to the universe, but they assigned them a false position in the work of redemption and a false relation to the Church. Hence Paul passes from the pre-eminence of the Son in the universe to speak of Him as Head of the Body. He is thus supreme alike in the universe and the Church.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ κεφαλὴ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σώματος</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,...">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:...">Ephesians 4:15-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23</a>).

For Christians as “severally members one of another,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-5.htm" title="So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.">Romans 12:5</a>. By this metaphor of “the head of the body” is meant that Christ is the Lord and Ruler of His Church, its directing brain, probably also that its life depends on continued union with Him. The Church is a body in the sense that it is a living organism, composed of members vitally united to each other, each member with his own place and function, each essential to the body’s perfect health, each dependent on the rest of the body for its life and well-being, while the whole organism and all the individual members derive all their life from the Head and act under His guidance. And as the body needs the Head, to be the source of its life and the controller of its activities, and to unify the members into an organic whole, so the Head needs the body to be His instrument in carrying out His designs. It is only in Colossians and Ephesians that Christ appears as Head of the Church, but the emphasis in Colossians is on the Headship, in Ephesians on the Church.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐκκλησίας</span>: often taken as in apposition to <span class="greekheb">σώματος</span>. For this we should have expected <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σώμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλ</span>. (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>). It may also be taken as epexegetical of <span class="greekheb">σώματος</span> (so Weiss and Haupt, who quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="Now he that has worked us for the selfsame thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit.">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a> as parallels, all of which, however, are not clear). <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλ</span>. is here the universal Church.—<span class="greekheb">ὅς ἐστιν</span>: inasmuch as He is. Paul is giving a reason for the position of the Son as <span class="greekheb">ἡ κεφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σώματος</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀρχή</span> is not to be taken in the sense of <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρχή</span>, nor is it certain that it has, as Lightfoot and others think, the sense of originating power. It is defined by <span class="greekheb">πρωτότ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νεκρῶν</span>, and this seems to throw the stress rather on the idea of supremacy than that of priority. There is perhaps a tacit reference to <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαὶ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>).—<span class="greekheb">πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν</span>: “firstborn from among the dead”. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. To him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,">Revelation 1:5</a> we have <span class="greekheb">ὁ πρωτότοκος τῶν νεκρῶν</span>, which expresses a different idea. If the temporal reference in <span class="greekheb">πρ</span>. is the more prominent, the meaning will be that He is the first to pass out of the dominion of death. But if sovereignty is the leading idea, the meaning is that from among the dead He has passed to His throne, where He reigns as the living Lord, who has overcome death, and who, before He surrenders the kingdom to the Father, will abolish it.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> … <span class="greekheb">πρωτεύων</span>: the purpose for which He is <span class="greekheb">ἀρχή</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρωτότ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">νεκρῶν</span>. He is supreme in the universe. He has to become supreme in relation to the Church. <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς</span> is emphatic; <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν</span> neuter not masculine, on account of the context.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18–20</span>.

The Son of God presides over His Church, but more—He is to it the constant Cause and mighty Source of spiritual vitality. “Because He lives, it lives also.” Its organization is rooted in Him, grows from Him, and refers to Him.

It is in fact “the Bride, the Lamb’s Wife,” of Revelation 21, only not yet manifested in bridal splendour. It is the “called, justified, and glorified” of Romans 8; “the Church of the firstborn” of Hebrews 12; “the royal priesthood, the people of possession,” of 1 Peter. All other Christian meanings of the word Church are derived and modified from this, but this must not be modified by them. See Hooker, <span class="ital">Eccl.

Here He is such, by a similar right, as to the whole spiritual creation.

HOOKER ON THE CHURCH. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“That Church of Christ which we properly term His body mystical, can be but one; neither can that one be sensibly discerned by any man, inasmuch as the parts thereof are some in heaven already with Christ, and the rest that are on earth (albeit their natural persons be visible) we do not discern under this property whereby they are truly and infallibly of that body. Only our minds by intellectual conceit are able to apprehend that such a real body there is, a body collective, because it containeth a huge multitude; a body mystical, because the mystery of their conjunction is removed altogether from sense. Whatsoever we read in Scripture concerning the endless love and the saving mercy which God sheweth towards His Church, the only proper subject thereof is this Church. Concerning this flock it is that our Lord and Saviour hath promised: ‘I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hands.’ They who are of this society have such marks and notes of distinction from all others as are not object unto our sense; only unto God, who seeth their hearts and understandeth all their secret thoughts and cogitations, unto Him they are clear and manifest. All men knew Nathanael to be an Israelite. But our Saviour, piercing deeper, giveth further testimony of him than men could have done with such certainty as He did, ‘Behold indeed an Israelite in whom there is no guile.’ If we profess, as Peter did, that we love the Lord, and profess it in the hearing of men … charitable men are likely to think we do so, as long as they see no proof to the contrary. But that our love is sound and sincere … who can pronounce, saving only the Searcher of all men’s hearts, who alone intuitively doth know in this kind who are His? And as those everlasting promises of love, mercy, and blessedness, belong to the mystical Church, even so on the other side when we read of any duty which the Church of God is bound unto, the Church whom this doth concern is a sensible known company. And this visible Church in like sort is but one.… Which company being divided into two moieties, the one before, the other since the coming of Christ, that part which since the coming of Christ partly hath embraced and partly shall hereafter embrace the Christian religion, we term as by a more proper name the Church of Christ.… The unity of which visible body and Church of Christ consisteth of that uniformity which all several persons thereunto belonging have, by reason of that one Lord, whose servants they all profess themselves; that one faith, which they all acknowledge; that one baptism, wherewith they are all initiated.… Entered we are not into the visible before our admittance by the door of baptism.… Christians by external profession they are all, whose mark of recognisance hath in it those things (one Lord, one faith, one baptism) which we have mentioned, yea, although they be impious idolaters, wicked heretics, persons excommunicable, yea and cast out for notorious improbity.… Is it then possible that the selfsame men should belong both to the synagogue of Satan and to the Church of Jesus Christ? Unto that Church which is His mystical body, not possible; because that body consisteth of none but only … true servants and saints of God. Howbeit of the visible body and Church of Jesus Christ, those may be, and oftentimes are, in respect of the main parts of their outward profession.… For lack of diligent observing the difference, first between the Church of God mystical and visible, then between the visible sound and corrupted, sometimes more, sometimes less;

The Pauline doctrine of the Church as the body of Christ is developed in Colossians and Ephesians, especially in the later Epistle, where it receives its fruitful application. Here the doctrine of the Person of Christ and the doctrine of the Church find their meeting-point as mutually implying each other, and together opposed to the double effect of early Gnosticism, which tended first to lower the dignity of Christ, and then to impair the unity of his Church (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>, note). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4, 5</a> the figure of the <span class="accented">body and members</span> is merely a passing illustration of the mutual relation of believers in the Church; now <span class="accented">the body of Christ</span> becomes the formal title of the Church, expressing the fundamental and fixed conception of its nature as related to him, who is the centre of its unity, the source of all vital energy and directing control within it (comp. the <span class="accented">vine and branches</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15.htm">John 15</a>.).

As explained by the following words, it denotes, as in philosophical Greek, a <span class="accented">first principle, originating cause, fens et origo</span> (see Lightfoot's note and references). To borrow "of the dead" from the following parallel clause weakens the force of both. His body, the Church, <span class="accented">begins</span> in him, dating and deriving from him its "all in all" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). This is quite consistent with the "all things are of God" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>; for the apostle is thinking here of the relative, historical beginning of <span class="accented">"the</span> kingdom of the Son" (ver. 13), there of the absolute beginning of the Divine work of redemption (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>; and note on "unto him," ver. 16).

He comes forth from among the dead as the first-born issues from the womb. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>, "having loosed the pains of death," where the Greek is &#x3c9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; birth-throes. There is a parallelism between first-born of the creation and first-born from the dead as regards the relation of headship in which Christ stands to creation and to the Church alike; but the parallelism is not complete. "He is the first-born from the dead as having been Himself one of the dead. He is not the first-born of all creation as being himself created" (Dwight).<p>In all things<p>The universe and the Church.<p>Might have the preeminence (&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., might become being first. &#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9; to be first only here in the New Testament. &#x393;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; become states a relation into which Christ came in the course of time: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; is (the first-born of all creation) states a relation of Christ's absolute being. He became head of the Church through His incarnation and passion, as He is head of the universe in virtue of His absolute and eternal being.

This sense is lost in the rendering might have the preeminence. </body></html>
