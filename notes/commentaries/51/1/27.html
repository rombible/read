Here we have again a significant illustration of the difference between the characteristic ideas of the two Epistles. In the Ephesian Epistle the unity of all in God’s covenant is first put forth, and then explained as dependent on the indwelling of Christ in the heart. Here the “Christ in you” is all in all: the unity of all men in Him is an inference, but one which the readers of the Epistle are left to draw for themselves. On the great idea itself, in the purely individual relation, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Philippians 1:21</a>, and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; in the more general form, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves.

But He suffered for the redemption of the church; we suffer on other accounts; for we do but slightly taste that cup of afflictions of which Christ first drank deeply. A Christian may be said to fill up that which remains of the sufferings of Christ, when he takes up his cross, and after the pattern of Christ, bears patiently the afflictions God allots to him. Let us be thankful that God has made known to us mysteries hidden from ages and generations, and has showed the riches of his glory among us. As Christ is preached among us, let us seriously inquire, whether he dwells and reigns in us; for this alone can warrant our assured hope of his glory. We must be faithful to death, through all trials, that we may receive the crown of life, and obtain the end of our faith, the salvation of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To whom - To the saints.<p>God would make known - "Willed (Greek) to make known;" that is, he was pleased to make this known. It was concealed in his bosom until he chose to reveal it to his apostles. It was a doctrine which the Jewish people did not understand; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5-6</a>.<p>What is the riches of the glory of this mystery - The rich glory of this great, long-concealed truth. On the use of the word "riches," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>. It is a favorite word with the apostle Paul to denote that which is valuable, or that which abounds. The meaning here is, that the truth that the gospel was to be preached to all mankind, was a truth abounding in glory.<p>Among the Gentiles - That is, the glory of this truth is manifested by the effects which it has produced among the Gentiles.<p>Which is Christ in you, the hope of glory - Or, Christ among you. Margin. The meaning is, that the whole of that truth, so full of glory, and so rich and elevated in its effect, is summed up in this - that Christ is revealed among you as the source of the hope of glory in a better world. This was the great truth which so animated the heart and fired the zeal of the apostle Paul. The wonderful announcement had burst on his mind like a flood of day, that the offer of salvation was not to be confined, as he had once supposed, to the Jewish people, but that all men were now placed on a level; that they had a common Saviour; that the same heaven was now opened for all, and that there were none so degraded and vile that they might not have the offer of life as well as others. This great truth Paul burned to communicate to the whole world; and for holding it, and in making it known, he had involved himself in all the difficulties which he had with his own countrymen; had suffered from want, and peril, and toil; and had finally been made a captive, and was expecting to be put to death. It was just such a truth as was fitted to fire such a mind as that of Paul, and to make it; known as worth all the sacrifices and toils which he endured. Life is well sacrificed in making known such a doctrine to the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. would&#8212;rather as Greek, "willed," or "was pleased to make known." He resolves all into God's good pleasure and will, that man should not glory save in God's grace.<p>what&#8212;How full and inexhaustible!<p>the riches of the glory of this mystery&#8212;He accumulates phrase on phrase to enhance the greatness of the blessing in Christ bestowed by God on the Gentiles. Compare Col 2:3, "all the treasures" of wisdom; Eph 3:8, "the unsearchable riches of Christ"; Eph 1:7, "riches of His grace." "The glory of this mystery" must be the glory which this once hidden, and now revealed, truth makes you Gentiles partakers of, partly now, but mainly when Christ shall come (Col 3:4; Ro 5:2; 8:17, 18; Eph 1:18). This sense is proved by the following: "Christ in you the hope of the (so Greek) glory." The lower was the degradation of you Gentiles, the higher is the richness of the glory to which the mystery revealed now raises you. You were "without Christ, and having no hope" (Eph 2:12). Now you have "Christ in you the hope of the glory" just mentioned. Alford translates, "Christ among you," to answer to "this mystery among the Gentiles." But the whole clause, "Christ IN you (Eph 3:17) the hope of glory," answers to "this mystery," and not to the whole sentence, "this mystery among the Gentiles." What is made known "among you Gentiles" is, "Christ in you (now by faith as your hidden life, Col 3:3; Ga 2:20) the hope of glory" (your manifested life). The contrast (antithesis) between "Christ in you" now as your hidden life, and "the hope of glory" hereafter to be manifested, requires this translation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To whom God would make known; </span> he refers the manifestation purely to God’s good will and pleasure, as Christ himself doth, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-26.htm" title="Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in your sight.">Matthew 11:26</a>,27 Lu 10:21</span>; so in the like case, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-18.htm" title="By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.">Revelation 9:18</a></span>; that having mentioned saints, none might conceit it was for foreseen faith, but the Colossians might value their privilege, reverently receive that grace which was not given to all: in short, to restrain curiosity why God would not do it otherwise or sooner, he cuts the knots of all questions, only by signifying his sovereign pleasure, he would make it known to them; elsewhere, this <span class="ital">mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a></span>, which was not to be touched till he thought meet to make it known. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">What is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles:</span> some refer <span class="ital">the glory</span> to <span class="ital">mystery, </span> as glorious mystery, because it lets forth Divine glory, and promiseth it to believers, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-14.htm" title="Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.">Luke 2:14</a></span>; others, and the most, rather to <span class="ital">riches, </span> and that either as its epithet, <span class="ital">{<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-11.htm" title=" Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness;">Colossians 1:11</a></span>}</span> the glorious riches of this mystery, or noting the subject, for salvation of the church amongst the Gentiles, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a> 3:7,8</span>.

The spring and cause of the manifestation of the Gospel to the saints, and chosen of God, is not their works, for God does not call them with an holy calling according to them, but according to his own grace; nor any preparations and dispositions in them before such manifestation, towards the Gospel and the truths of it, for there are none such naturally in men, but all the reverse; nor a foresight of their better improvement of it, when made known, for this is not the method of divine grace, witness the instances of Sodom and Gomorrha, Tyre and Sidon; nor any holiness in them, or because they were sanctified, for they became so by the power of divine grace, through the Gospel revelation; but it is the pure sovereign good will and pleasure of God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>; as appears from what they were before the Gospel came unto them, what is made known to them in it and by it; and from this, that they and not others, equally as deserving, are favoured with it: <p>what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. The apostle, besides calling the Gospel a "mystery", as before, ascribes "glory" to it; it is a glorious mystery, there is a glory in all the mysteries of it; it is a glorious Gospel, as it is often called, in its author, subject, matter, use, and efficacy: and also "riches" of glory, or glorious riches; containing rich truths, an immense treasure of them, comparable to gold, silver, and precious stones; rich blessings of justification, pardon, reconciliation, adoption, and eternal life; and rich promises, relating both to this life, and that which is to come; all which were opened and made known, not to the Jews only, but "among the Gentiles" also; who before were aliens, enemies, exceeding wicked, poor, blind, and miserable, but now, through the Gospel, were become rich and glorious, wise, knowing, and happy: <p>which is Christ in you, the hope of glory; this is to be connected with all that goes before: Christ is the riches of the Gospel; the riches of the divine perfections, which the Gospel more clearly displays than the works of creation or providence, are all in Christ, the fulness of them dwells in him; and this is the grace the Gospel reveals, that he, who was rich with all these, became poor to make us rich; the rich promises of the Gospel were all made to Christ, and are all yea and "Amen" in him; the rich blessings of it are all in his hands, righteousness, peace, and pardon, the riches both of grace and glory; the rich treasures of its divine truths are hid in him; and he is the substance of everyone of them: Christ is also the glory of the Gospel, inasmuch as he is the author, preacher, and subject of it; it is full of the glory of his person, both as the only begotten of the Father, and as the only Mediator between God and man; it is the glass through which this is seen: moreover, the glory of God in him is expressed hereby; the glory of his wisdom and power, of his truth and faithfulness, of his justice and holiness, of his love, grace, and mercy, and every other perfection, is eminently held forth in the Gospel; as this is great in the salvation and redemption of his people by Christ, which the Gospel brings the good news of; add to this, that that glory which the saints shall have with Christ, and will lie in the enjoyment of him to all eternity, is brought to light in the Gospel: Christ is also the mystery of the Gospel; he is one of the persons in the mystery of the Trinity; the mystery of his divine sonship, of his divine person, being God and yet man, man and yet God, and both in one person, and of his incarnation and redemption, makes a considerable part of the Gospel: and Christ, who is the sum and substance of it, is "in" his people; not only as the omnipresent God, as the author of the light of nature, as the Creator of all things, in whom all live, move, and have their beings, but in a way of special grace; and the phrase is expressive of a revelation of him in them, of their possession of him, of his inhabitation in them by his Spirit and grace, particularly by faith, and of their communion with him, in consequence of their union to him; and being so, he is the ground and foundation of their hopes of glory. There is a glory which the saints are hoping for, which the glories of this world are but a faint resemblance of; which is unseen at present, and which the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared unto; what is eternal, and which Christ has entered into, and took possession of; and what will greatly consist in beholding his glory, and in everlasting communion with him; this through grace saints have a good hope of, and are waiting for, and even rejoice at times in the hope of it; of which hope Christ is the foundation; for not only the promise of it is with him, but the glory itself is in his hands; the gift of it is with him, and through him; he has made way by his sufferings and death for the enjoyment of it, and is now preparing it for them, by his presence and intercession; his grace makes them meet for it, his righteousness gives them a title to it, and his Spirit is the earnest of it, and the substance of it will be the fruition of himself. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To whom God <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> would make known what <i>is</i> the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</span><p>(u) In this way Paul restrains the curiosity of men.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>.

The text yields this definition of the sense from the very connection with the quantitative idea <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλοῦτος</span>. (2) All the substantives are to be left in their full solemn force, without being resolved into adjectives (Erasmus, Luther, and many others: the glorious riches; Beza: “divitiae gloriosi hujus mysterii”). Chrysostom aptly remarks: <span class="greekheb">σεμνῶς εἶπε καὶ ὄγκον ἐπέθηκεν ἀπὸ πολλῆς διαθέσεως</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐπιτάσεις ζητῶς ἐπιτάσεων</span>. Comp. Calvin: “<span class="ital">magniloquus</span> est in extollenda evangelii dignitate.” (3) As <span class="greekheb">τῆς δόξης</span> is governed by <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλοῦτος</span>, so also is <span class="greekheb">τοῦ μυστηρίου</span> governed by <span class="greekheb">τῆς δόξης</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἔθν</span>. belongs to the <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span> which is to be supplied, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a>. (4) According to the context, the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> cannot be anything else (see immediately below, <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς δόξης</span>) than the <span class="ital">Messianic</span> glory, the glory of the <span class="ital">kingdom</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm" title="For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.">Romans 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>, <span class="ital">et al</span>.), the glorious blessing of the <span class="greekheb">κληρονομία</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm" title=" Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:">Colossians 1:12</a>), which before the Parousia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a> f.) is the ideal (<span class="greekheb">ἐλπίς</span>), but after it is the realized, possession of believers. Hence it is neither to be taken in the sense of the <span class="ital">glorious effects generally</span>, which the gospel produces among the Gentiles (Chrysostom, Theophylact, and many others, including Huther, comp. Dalmer), nor in that specially of their <span class="ital">conversion from death to life</span> (Hofmann), whereby its glory is unfolded. Just as little, however, is the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> <span class="ital">of God</span> meant, in particular His wisdom and grace, which manifest themselves objectively in the making known of the mystery, and realize themselves subjectively by moral glorification and by the hope of eternal glory (de Wette), or the <span class="ital">splendor internus</span> of true Christians, or the bliss of the latter combined with their moral dignity (Böhmer). (5) The genitive of the subject, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ μυστηρίου τούτου</span>, defines the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> as that <span class="ital">contained</span> in the <span class="greekheb">μυατήριον</span>, previously unknown, but now become manifest with the mystery that has been made known, as the blessed <span class="ital">contents</span> of the latter.

According to a familiar attraction (Winer, p. 157 [E.

Following the Vulgate and Chrysostom, <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span> is frequently referred to <span class="greekheb">τοῦ μυστηρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τούτον</span>: “this mystery consists in Christ’s being among you, the Gentiles,” Huther, comp. Ewald. The context, however, is fatal to this view; partly in general, because it is not the mystery itself, but the riches of its glory, that forms the main idea in the foregoing; and partly, in particular, because the way has been significantly prepared for <span class="greekheb">ὅς ἐστι</span> through <span class="greekheb">τί</span>, while <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> corresponds[73] to the <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν</span> referring to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΟῦΤΟς</span></span></span>, and the following <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἡ ἘΛΠῚς Τῆς ΔΌΞΗς</span></span></span> glances back to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΟῦΤΟς Τῆς ΔΌΞΗς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ΧΡΙΣΤΌς</span></span></span>] Christ Himself, see above.

The expression does not mean the glorious riches, but rather how rich is the glory. The use of “glory” immediately after in the sense of the Messianic kingdom favours the adoption of that meaning here. But as it is an attribute of the mystery it probably expresses its glorious character.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν</span> is generally taken with <span class="greekheb">τί τὸ πλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and this gives an excellent sense, for it was as manifested in the Gentile mission that the glory of the Gospel was especially displayed. There is a little awkwardness, since the definition <span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν</span> seems to make <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔθν</span>. unnecessary. The glory of the mystery was itself <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμ</span>. if we take <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμῖν</span> to mean among you Gentiles. This hardly justifies us in connecting the words with <span class="greekheb">γνωρίσαι</span> (Haupt), for it already has the recipients of knowledge attached to it (<span class="greekheb">οἷς</span>).—<span class="greekheb">ὅ ἐστι</span> answers <span class="greekheb">τί τὸ πλοῦτος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. The riches of the glory of the mystery consist in <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἐλπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δ</span>. Usually <span class="greekheb">ὃ</span> is taken to refer to <span class="greekheb">μυστηρίου</span> alone. Perhaps the practical difference is not great.—<span class="greekheb">Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς δόξης</span>. Haupt thinks no comma should be placed after <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, and that the meaning is that the special glory of the Gospel is that Christ among them is the hope of glory. But the usual view which makes, not the fact that Christ among them guarantees their future blessedness, but the presence of Christ itself, the great glory of the mystery seems much finer. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμ</span>., and not what <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑμ</span>. is, constitutes the riches of the glory. The context shows that <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> must mean “you Gentiles”. It does not necessarily follow from this that <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> must be translated “among,” though this is favoured by <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἔθν</span>. It may refer to the indwelling of Christ in the heart, and this is rendered probable by the addition of <span class="greekheb">ἐλπὶς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόξης</span>. The indwelling Christ constitutes in Himself a pledge of future glory. For this combination of the indwelling Christ with the Christian hope, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">would</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">willed</span>, or (as R.V.) <span class="bld">was pleased</span>.

The “Mystery” is, in fact, the Divine plan of a Church gathered from all mankind, and filled, in its every member, and in the resulting total of its life and power, with Jesus Christ. For commentary, see the Ep. to the Ephesians, esp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-21.htm" title=" Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.">Colossians 3:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which is</span>] “The mystery passes into the living Christ” (Bp Alexander, in <span class="ital">The Speaker’s Commentary</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Christ in you</span>] The rendering “<span class="ital">among you</span>” (A.V., margin) is equally good grammatically. Alford and Ellicott adopt it, while remarking that it includes and implies “<span class="ital">in you</span>.” Lightfoot, not without hesitation, thinks “<span class="ital">in you</span>” more probable. R.V. retains “<span class="ital">in you</span>,” without marginal alternative. This surely is right. The deeply kindred passage in Ephesians 2 culminates with the wonderful possibility and fact of the “dwelling of Christ <span class="ital">in our hearts</span> by faith;” it makes this the central sanctuary, so to speak, of the work and experience of grace. In this briefer but equally intense passage it seems congruous that the climax of thought should be the same.—We would say rather that “<span class="ital">in you</span>” includes and implies “<span class="ital">among you</span>” than <span class="ital">vice versâ</span>. This appears to be, on the whole, Lightfoot’s view. He compares (besides Ephesians 3) <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm" title="And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.">Romans 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm" title="Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves.

But we mean that the tone of these words, in the light of the fuller kindred (Ephesian) passage, leads us rightly to see <span class="ital">here</span> the richest possible meaning in the briefer phrase.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the hope of glory</span>] See again Ephesians 3 for commentary. The Indwelling of the Lord in the saints, received by faith, in the power of the Holy Ghost, is connected by indissoluble links of truth and thought with the foreview of blessings “in the Church, in Christ Jesus, throughout all ages.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Who shall discuss and analyse such a statement? It is a matter for adoring wonder, simplest faith, and a most blessed and genuine experience, now as when it was written. While our justification in Christ is, from one all-important point, the sure reason and pledge of our coming “glory” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:...">Romans 5:1-2</a>), Christ’s most true and living presence as the Risen One in us is, as it were, the very bud of the celestial flower, the actual dawn of the eternal day. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;">1 Timothy 1:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Glory:</span>”—undoubtedly, in connexion with the word “<span class="ital">hope</span>,” the word points to the heavenly Future, in which alike in the saint and in the Church of the saints the unveiled Face of God will develope an eternity of holy bliss and power, all drawn from Him and all spent for Him.

"Willed" stands emphatically first in the Greek. The revelation was so momentous in its issue, so signal in its method, and so contrary to human foresight and prejudice, that it proceeded evidently from" the will of God" (vers. 1, 9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-18.htm">Romans 9:18</a>): "Who was I," said St. Peter, "that I could withstand God?" The Ephesian letter delights to dwell on <span class="accented">God's will</span> as the cause of the whole counsel and work of salvation. The Revisers have rendered the verb by "was pleased," the equivalent of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> (ver. 19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5, 9</a>; etc.). There is no need to seek a reference to <span class="accented">free grace</span> in the verb "willed;" the two ideas are concurrent, but distinct (see, however, Lightfoot). The apostle's mind is filled with amazement as he contemplates the boundless <span class="accented">riches</span> which the salvation of the Gentiles revealed in God himself (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8-10</a>). "The glory of this mystery" is the splendour with which it invests the Divine character (on "glory," see note, ver. 11; and for "riches of glory," <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-23.htm">Romans 9:23</a>). <span class="accented">Amongst the Gentiles:</span> "semi-local clause, defining the sphere in which the riches of the glory is more specially evinced" (Ellicott).

By a bold metonymy, the <span class="accented">mystery</span> is identified with its subject or content. It is "Christ" himself (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>, note), the Divine secret of the ages, the burden of all revelation; and "Christ in you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>), Christ dwelling in Gentile carts - this is the wonder of wonders! So the "sinners of the Gentiles" receive "the like [equal] gift" with the heirs of the promises (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17</a>). By a further and yet bolder apposition, this mystery of <span class="accented">Christ in Colossian believers</span> is <span class="cmt_word">made one with the hope of glory</span> (vers. 5, 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-12.htm">Ephesians 1:12-14, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-43.htm">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>), of which it is a pledge and a foretaste (vers. 4, 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10-17</a>). This <span class="accented">glory</span> is that which the Christian will wear in his perfected, heavenly state (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-43.htm">1 Corinthians 15:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>), when he will fully reflect the glory he now beholds in God through Christ ("the glory of this mystery"): compare the double "glory" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm">2 Corinthians 3:18</a>. The rights of the Gentile believer in Christ are therefore complete (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). Possessing him now in his heart, he anticipates all that he will bestow in heaven (on "hope," see ver. 5). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Would make known (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit., willed to make known.

This glory is the manifestation of the kingdom of Christ among the Gentiles as their inheritance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>). The richness exhibited itself in the free dispensation of the Gospel to the Gentile as well as to the Jew. It was not limited by national lines. Compare "the same Lord is rich unto all," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12</a>; and beggarly elements, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>.<p>Which is Christ in you<p>The readings differ. Some read &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c2;, masculine, which, referring to the riches: others &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;, neuter, which, referring to mystery. The latter corresponds with <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm">Colossians 2:2</a>, the mystery of God, Christ, etc. In either case the defining words are Christ in you, i.e., in the Gentiles; either as constituting the richness of glory in this mystery, or as being the essence of the myself itself. In you may be either within you, dwelling in your hearts, or among you. The latter accords with among the Gentiles, the former with dwell in your hearts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-5.htm">2 Corinthians 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>.<p>The hope of glory (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., of the glory. The Gentiles, in receiving the manifestation of Christ, did not realize all its glory. The full glory of the inheritance was a hope, to be realized when Christ should appear "the second time unto salvation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>). Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1</a>. Glory refers to the glory of the mystery; hence the glory, but with more emphasis upon the idea of the same glory consummated at Christ's coming - the glory which shall be revealed.
