We note accordingly (1) that the word “image” (like the word “form,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-6.htm" title="Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:">Philippians 2:6-7</a>) is used in the New Testament for real and essential embodiment, as distinguished from mere likeness. Thus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a> we read, “The law, having a shadow of good things to come, and not <span class= "ital">the very image</span> of the things;” we note also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-23.htm" title="And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beasts, and creeping things.">Romans 1:23</a> the distinction between the mere outward “likeness” and the “image” which it represented; we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-49.htm" title="And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.">1Corinthians 15:49</a> that the “image of the earthy” and “the image of the heavenly” Adam denote actual identity of nature with both; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2Corinthians 3:18</a> the actual work of the Spirit in the heart is described as “changing us from glory to glory” into “the image” of the glorified Christ. (2) Next we observe that although, speaking popularly, St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm" title="For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.">1Corinthians 11:7</a> calls man “the image and glory of God,” yet the allusion is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm" title="And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moves on the earth.">Genesis 1:28</a>, where man is said, with stricter accuracy, to be made “after the image of God” (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>, “created after God”), and this more accurate expression is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a> of this Epistle, “renewed after the image of Him that created him.” Who then, or what, is the “image of God,” after which man is created? St. Paul here emphatically (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2Corinthians 4:4</a> parenthetically) answers “Christ,” as the Son of God, “first-born before all creation.” The same truth is conveyed in a different form, clearer (if possible) even than this, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>, where “the Son” is said to be not only “the brightness of the glory of the Father,” but “the express image of His Person.” For the word “express image” is <span class= "ital">character</span> in the original, used here (as when we speak of the alphabetical “characters”) to signify the visible drawn image, and the word “Person” is <span class= "ital">substance</span> or <span class= "ital">essence.</span> (3) It is not to be forgotten that at this time in the Platonising Judaism of Philo, “the Word” was called the eternal “image of God.” (See passages quoted in Dr. Light-foot’s note on this passage.) This expression was not peculiar to him; it was but a working out of that personification of the “wisdom of God,” of which we have a magnificent example in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/8-22.htm" title="The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.">Proverbs 8:22-30</a>, and of which we trace the effect in the Alexandrine Book of “Wisdom” (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-25.htm" title="For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore can no defiled thing fall into her.">Wisdom Of Solomon 7:25-26</a>). “Wisdom is the breath of the power of God, and a pure stream from the glory of the Most High—the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of His goodness.” It seems to have represented in the Jewish schools the idea complementary to the ordinary idea of the Messiah in the Jewish world. Just as St. John took up the vague idea of “the Word,” and gave it a clear divine personality in Christ, so St. Paul seems to act here in relation to the other phrase, used as a description of the Word. In Christ he fixes in solid reality the floating vision of the “image of God.” (4) There is an emphasis on the words “of the invisible God.” Now, since the whole context shows that the reference is to the eternal pre-existence of Christ, ancient interpreters (of whom Chrysostom may be taken as the type) argued that the image of the invisible must be also invisible. But this seems opposed to the whole idea of the word “image,” and to its use in the New Testament and elsewhere. The true key to this passage is in our Lord’s own words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-8.htm" title="He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.">John 1:8</a>, “No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son” (here is the remarkable reading, “the only begotten God”), “who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath revealed Him.” In anticipation of the future revelation of Godhead, Christ, even as pre-existent, is called “The image of the invisible God.”<p><span class= "bld">The firstborn of every creature</span> (<span class= "ital">of all creation</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span>—(1) <span class= "ital">As to the sense of this clause.</span> The grammatical construction here will bear either the rendering of our version, or the rendering “begotten before all creation,” whence comes the “begotten before all worlds “of the Nicene creed. But the whole context shows that the latter is unquestionably the true rendering. For, as has been remarked from ancient times, He is said to be “begotten” and not “created;” next, he is emphatically spoken of below as He “by whom all things were created,” who is “before all things,” and in whom all things consist.” (2) <span class= "ital">As to the order of idea.</span> In Himself He is “the image of God” from all eternity. From this essential conception, by a natural contrast, the thought immediately passes on to distinction from, and priority to, all created being. Exactly in this same order of idea, we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2-3</a>, “By whom also He made the worlds . . . upholding all things by the word of His power;” and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3</a>, “All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made which was made. Here St. Paul indicates this idea in the words “firstborn before all creation,” and works it out in the verses following. (3) <span class= "ital">As to the name “firstborn</span>” <span class= "ital">itself.</span> It is used of the Messiah as an almost technical name (derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm" title="I will declare the decree: the LORD has said to me, You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.">Psalm 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-28.htm" title="My mercy will I keep for him for ever more, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.">Psalm 89:28</a>), as is shown in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>, “when He bringeth the first begotten into the world.” In tracing the Messianic line of promise we notice that; while the Messiah is always true man, “the seed of Abraham,” “the son of David,” yet on him are accumulated attributes too high for any created being (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>). He is declared to be an “Emmanuel” God with us; and His kingdom a visible manifestation of God. Hence the idea contained in the word “firstborn” is not only sovereignty “above all the kings of the earth” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-28.htm" title="My mercy will I keep for him for ever more, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.">Psalm 89:28</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/8-13.htm" title="Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?">Daniel 8:13-14</a>), but also likeness to God and priority to all created being. (4) <span class= "ital">As to the union of the two clauses.</span> In the first we have the declaration of His eternal unity with God—all that was completely embodied in the declaration of the “Word who is God,” up to which all the higher Jewish speculations had led; in the second we trace the distinctness of His Person, as the “begotten of the Father,” the true Messiah of Jewish hopes, and the subordination of the co-eternal Son to the Father. The union of the two marks the assertion of Christian mystery, as against rationalising systems, of the type of Arianism on one side, of Sabellianism on the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/colossians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">Who </span>— That is, the Son of God, in whose blood we have redemption; <span class="ital">is the image of the invisible God </span>— By the description here given of the glory of Christ, and his pre-eminence over the highest angels, the apostle lays a foundation for the reproof of all worshippers of angels. The Socinians contend that Christ is here styled the image of the invisible God, merely because he made known to men the will of God; and that in this sense only Christ said to Philip, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?">John 14:9</a>,) <span class="ital">He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. </span>But it should be considered, that in other passages in Scripture, the word <span class="ital">image </span>denotes <span class="ital">likeness, </span>if not <span class="ital">sameness </span>of nature and properties, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-49.htm" title="And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.">1 Corinthians 15:49</a> : <span class="ital">As we have borne the image of the earthly, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly. </span>Certainly, as Dr. Whitby observes, the more natural import of the phrase is, that Christ is therefore called the image of God, because he made him, who is invisible in his essence, conspicuous to us by the divine works he wrought, they being such as plainly showed that in him <span class="ital">dwelt the fulness of the Godhead bodily; </span>for the invisible God can only be seen by the effects of his power, wisdom, and goodness, and of his other attributes. He who, by the works both of the old and new creation, hath given such clear demonstrations of the divine power, wisdom, and goodness, is, upon this account, as much the image of God as it is possible any person or thing should be; and to this sense the expression seems here necessarily restrained by the connective particle <span class="greekheb">οτι</span>, <span class="ital">for. </span>He is the image of God, <span class="ital">for by him all things were created. </span>Moreover, this passage in exactly parallel to that in the beginning of the epistle to the Hebrews, as will evidently appear on a comparison of the two. Here he is said to be the image of God; there, <span class="ital">the brightnes</span>s (<span class="greekheb">απαυγασμα</span>, <span class="ital">effulgence</span>) <span class="ital">of his </span>Father’s <span class="ital">glory, and the express image of his person, </span>or <span class="ital">substance, </span>as <span class="greekheb">υποστασεως </span>more properly signifies: here he is called <span class="ital">the firstborn, </span>or <span class="ital">Lord, of every creature; </span>there, the <span class="ital">heir of all things: </span>here it is said that <span class="ital">all things were created by him; </span>there, that <span class="ital">he made the worlds: </span>here, that <span class="ital">by him all things do consist; </span>and there, that <span class="ital">he upholdeth all things by the word of his power. </span>Now, that he is there styled <span class="ital">the image of God’s glory, </span>and <span class="ital">the express image </span>or <span class="ital">character of his person, </span>or substance, by reason of that divine power, wisdom, and majesty, which shone forth in his actions, some Socinians are forced to confess. It is not, therefore, to be doubted that he is here styled the image of God in the same sense. And it is highly probable that he is called <span class="ital">the image of the invisible God, </span>as appearing to the patriarchs, and representing to them the Father, <span class="ital">who dwells in light inaccessible; </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.">1 Timothy 6:16</a>;) according to what is frequently observed by the ante-Nicene fathers, that God the Father being <span class="ital">invisible, </span>and <span class="ital">one whom no man hath seen or can see, </span>appeared to the patriarchs by his Son. Add to this, that the Son is likewise called the <span class="ital">image of God, </span>because he manifested the divine perfections in the flesh visibly, by that fulness of grace and truth which shone in him during his abode on earth. This St. John’s words evidently imply: <span class="ital">No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. </span>See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>. In which sense Christ’s words to Philip also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?">John 14:9</a>) are to be understood: <span class="ital">He that hath seen me hath seen the Father, </span>as our Lord manifestly shows, when he adds, <span class="ital">I am in the Father, and the Father in me: the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. </span>And <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, he is plainly styled <span class="ital">the image of God, </span>for the like reason, because (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm" title=" Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:">Colossians 1:6</a>) <span class="ital">the light of the knowledge of the glory of God </span>is reflected from <span class="ital">his face, </span>or <span class="ital">person, </span>as <span class="greekheb">προσωπω </span>signifies. See the notes there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The firstborn </span>— Or <span class="ital">first-begotten, </span>(<span class="greekheb">πρωτοτοκος</span>,) <span class="ital">of every creature </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">of the whole creation, </span>as <span class="greekheb">πασα κτισις </span>is translated <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-22.htm" title="For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.">Romans 8:22</a>, existing before it, and the heir and Lord of it. “According to the Arians, the <span class="ital">firstborn of the whole creation </span>is the <span class="ital">first-made creature. </span>But the reason advanced to prove the Son <span class="ital">the firstborn of the whole creation </span>overturns that sense of this passage; for surely the Son’s creating all things doth not prove him to be the first-made creature; unless his power of creating all things originated from his being the first-made creature; which no one will affirm. As little does the Son’s creating all things prove that he created himself. Yet these absurdities will be established by the apostle’s reasoning, if the <span class="ital">firstborn of the whole creation </span>signifies the <span class="ital">first-made creature. </span>But it is proper to observe, that <span class="greekheb">πρωτοτοκος</span>, <span class="ital">the firstborn, </span>or <span class="ital">first-begotten, </span>in this passage, may signify the <span class="ital">heir, </span>or <span class="ital">Lord: </span>of the whole creation. For, anciently, the <span class="ital">firstborn </span>was entitled to possess his father’s estate, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-3.htm" title="And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.">2 Chronicles 21:3</a>. The <span class="ital">firstborn </span>was likewise lord of his brethren, who were all his servants. This appears from what Isaac said to Esau, after he had bestowed the rights of primogeniture on Jacob, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-37.htm" title="And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to you, my son?">Genesis 27:37</a>. Hence, among the Hebrews and other nations, <span class="ital">firstborn, heir, </span>and <span class="ital">lord, </span>were synonymous terms. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-1.htm" title="Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;">Galatians 4:1</a>. According to this interpretation of the terms <span class="ital">firstborn </span>and <span class="ital">heir, </span>the apostle’s reasoning is perfectly just: for <span class="ital">the creation </span>of all things, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>,) and the <span class="ital">making of the world, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>,) through the Son, is a direct proof that he is the firstborn, <span class="ital">heir, </span>or <span class="ital">Lord </span>of the whole.” See Whitby and Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 Christ in his human nature, is the visible discovery of the invisible God, and he that hath seen Him hath seen the Father. Let us adore these mysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is the image of the invisible God - &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  eiko&#772;n tou Theou tou aoratou. The objects. here, as it is in the parallel place in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-23</a>, is to give a just view of the exaltation of the Redeemer. It is probable that, in both cases, the design is to meet some erroneous opinion on this subject that prevailed in those churches, or among those that claimed to be teachers there. See the Introduction to this Epistle, and compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-23</a>. For the meaning of the phrase occurring here, "the image of the invisible God," see the <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, note, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, note. The meaning is, that he represents to mankind the perfections of God, as an image, figure, or drawing does the object which it is made to resemble. See the word "image" - &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3bd;  eiko&#772;n - explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1</a>. It properly denotes that which is a copy or delineation of a thing; which accurately and fully represents it, in contradistinction from a rough sketch, or outline; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-49.htm">1 Corinthians 15:49</a>.<p>The meaning here is, that the being and perfections of God are accurately and fully represented by Christ. In what respects particularly he was thus a representative of God, the apostle proceeds to state in the following verses, to wit, in his creative power, in his eternal existence, in his heirship over the universe, in the fulness that dwelt in him. This cannot refer to him merely as incarnate, for some of the things affirmed of him pertained to him before his incarnation; and the idea is, that in all things Christ fairly represents to us the divine nature and perfections. God is manifest to us through him; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>. We see God in him as we see an object in that which is in all respects an exact copy of it. God is invisible. No eye has seen him, or can see him; but in what Christ is, and has done in the works of creation and redemption, we have a fair and full representation of what God is; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>, note.<p>The first-born of every creature - Among all the creatures of God, or over all his creation, occupying the rank and pro-eminence of the first-born. The first-born, or the oldest son, among the Hebrews as elsewhere, had special privileges. He was entitled to a double portion of the inheritance. It has been, also, and especially in oriental countries, a common thing for the oldest son to succeed to the estate and the title of his father. In early times, the first-born son was the officiating priest in the family, in the absence or on the death of the father. There can be no doubt that the apostle here has reference to the usual distinctions and honors conferred on the first-born, and means to say that, among all the creatures of God, Christ occupied a pre-eminence similar to that. He does not say that, in all respects, he resembled the first-born in a family; nor does he say that he himself was a creature, for the point of his comparison does not turn on these things, and what he proceeds to affirm respecting him is inconsistent with the idea of his being a created being himself.<p>He that "created all things that are in heaven and that are in earth," was not himself created. That the apostle did not mean to represent him as a creature, is also manifest from the reason which he assigns why he is called the first-born. "He is the image of God, and the first-born of every creature, for - &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;  hoti - by him were all things created." That is, he sustains the elevated rank of the first-born, or a high eminence over the creation, because by him "all things were created in heaven and in earth." The language used here, also, does not fairly imply that he was a creature, or that he was in nature and rank one of those in relation to whom it is said he was the first-born. It is true that the word "first-born" - &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  pro&#772;totokos - properly means the first-born child of a father or mother, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-25.htm">Matthew 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>; or the first-born of animals. But two things are also to be remarked in regard to the use of the word:<p>(1) It does not necessarily imply that anyone is born afterward in the family, for it would be used of the first-born, though an only child; and,<p>(2) it is used to denote one who is chief, or who is highly distinguished and pre-eminent. Thus, it is employed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, "That he might be the first-born among many brethren." So, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>, it is said that he was "the first-born from the dead;" not that he was literally the first that was raised from the dead, which was not the fact, but that he might be pre-eminent among those that are raised; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>. The meaning, then, is, that Christ sustains the most exalted rank in the universe; he is pre-eminent above all others; he is at the head of all things. The expression does not mean that he was "begotten before all creatures," as it is often explained, but refers to the simple fact that he sustains the highest rank over the creation. He is the Son of God. He is the heir of all things. All other creatures are also the "offspring of God;" but he is exalted as the Son of God above all.<p>(This clause has been variously explained. The most commonly received, and, as we think, best supported opinion, is that which renders &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  pro&#772;totokos pase&#772;s ktiseo&#772;s; "begotten before all creation." This most natural and obvious sense would have been more readily admitted, had it not been supposed hostile to certain views on the sonship of Christ. Some explain &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  pro&#772;totokos actively, and render "first begetter or producer of all things," which gives, at all events, a sense consistent with truth and with the context, which immediately assigns as the reason of Christ being styled &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  pro&#772;totokos, the clause beginning &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;  hoti en auto&#772; ektisthe&#772;, "For by him were all things created." Others, with the author explain the word figuratively, of pre-eminence or lordship. To this view however, there are serious objections.<p>It seems not supported by sufficient evidence. No argument can be drawn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a> until it is proved that "firstborn from the dead," does not mean the first that was raised to die no more, which Doddridge affirms to be "the easiest, surest, most natural sense, in which the best commentators are agreed." Nor is the argument from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a> satisfactory. "&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Pro&#772;totokos," says Bloomfield, at the close of an admirable note on this verse, "is not well taken by Whitby and others, in a figurative sense, to denote 'Lord of all things, since the word is never so used, except in reference to primogeniture. And although, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, we have &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  ton pro&#772;totokos en pollois adelphois, yet there his followers are represented not as his creatures, but as his brethren. On which, and other accounts, the interpretation, according to which we have here a strong testimony to the eternal filiation of our Saviour is greatly preferable; and it is clear that <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a> are illustrative of the nature, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a> are an evidence of the pre-existence and divinity of Christ.") <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. They who have experienced in themselves "redemption" (Col 1:14), know Christ in the glorious character here described, as above the highest angels to whom the false teachers (Col 2:18) taught worship was to be paid. Paul describes Him: (1) in relation to God and creation (Col 1:15-17); (2) in relation to the Church (Col 1:18-20). As the former regards Him as the Creator (Col 1:15, 16) and the Sustainer (Col 1:17) of the natural world; so the latter, as the source and stay of the new moral creation.<p>image&#8212;exact likeness and perfect Representative. Adam was made "in the image of God" (Ge 1:27). But Christ, the second Adam, perfectly reflected visibly "the invisible God" (1Ti 1:17), whose glories the first Adam only in part represented. "Image" (eicon) involves "likeness" (homoiosis); but "likeness" does not involve "image." "Image" always supposes a prototype, which it not merely resembles, but from which it is drawn: the exact counterpart, as the reflection of the sun in the water: the child the living image of the parent. "Likeness" implies mere resemblance, not the exact counterpart and derivation as "image" expresses; hence it is nowhere applied to the Son, while "image" is here, compare 1Co 11:7 [Trench]. (Joh 1:18; 14:9; 2Co 4:4; 1Ti 3:16; Heb 1:3). Even before His incarnation He was the image of the invisible God, as the Word (Joh 1:1-3) by whom God created the worlds, and by whom God appeared to the patriarchs. Thus His essential character as always "the image of God," (1) before the incarnation, (2) in the days of His flesh, and (3) now in His glorified state, is, I think, contemplated here by the verb "is."<p>first-born of every creature&#8212;(Heb 1:6), "the first-begotten": "begotten of His Father before all worlds" [Nicene Creed]. Priority and superlative dignity is implied (Ps 89:27). English Version might seem to favor Arianism, as if Christ were a creature. Translate, "Begotten (literally, 'born') before every creature," as the context shows, which gives the reason why He is so designated. "For," &c. (Col 1:16, 17) [Trench]. This expression is understood by Origen (so far is the Greek from favoring Socinian or Arian views) as declaring the Godhead of Christ, and is used by Him as a phrase to mark that Godhead, in contrast with His manhood [Book 2, sec. Against Celsus]. The Greek does not strictly admit Alford's translation, "the first-born of all creation."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Having touched on the benefit of Christ’s sacrifice, which implies his human nature, he doth here rise higher, to set forth the dignity of his person, (which made it satisfactory), both with respect to his Father and the creature.

The apostle in this place doth not say simply Christ the image of God, but <span class="bld">of the invisible God, </span>( considered personally), i.e. the Father; because the Father cannot be known to us but in his Son, as in an image, in which he would represent or manifest himself to be seen or known, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>,18 Joh 14:8,9 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a></span>.

Not (as the Lutherans strangely imagine) that Christ is omnipotent with the omnipotency of the Divine nature, or omniscient with that omnisciency, as if the manhood did instrumentally use the attributes of the Godhead; but such perfections are really inherent in and appertaining to the manhood, by virtue of its union with the Divine nature in the Second Person of the Trinity, that though they are vastly short of the attributes which are essential to the Godhead, yet they are the completest image of them, and such as no mere creature is capable of.

The Greek scholiast and several of the Greek fathers go this way; not as if the ineffable generation of Christ had any beginning, as some falsely conceited Christ to be made in time, just in the beginning before the world, by whom as an instrument all the rest were created; but the apostle doth not say he was first made, or first created; but, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm" title=" And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.">Colossians 1:17</a></span>, was, or did exist, <span class="bld">before all things</span> besides; (as John Baptist said, <span class="bld">he was before me, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a></span>); and therefore none of the rank of all them, but of another, viz. equal with his Father, whose image he was, above all that was made or created: he was not created at all, though first-born, or first-begotten, yet not first-created, (being distinguished here from created, as the cause from the effect), as it refers to him that begets, so it may to only begotten, Christ being so begotten as no other was or could be, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-22.htm" title="The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.">Proverbs 8:22</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm" title="But you, Bethlehem Ephratah, though you be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall he come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting.">Micah 5:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm" title="For to which of the angels said he at any time, You are my Son, this day have I begotten you?

Not of deity, though the fulness of it dwells in him; nor of himself, though he is the true God, and eternal life; nor of the Spirit, who also is God, and the Spirit of the Son; but the Father, called "God", not to the exclusion of the Son or Spirit, who are with him the one God: "and he is invisible"; not to the Son who lay in his bosom, and had perfect and infinite knowledge of him; nor, in some sense, to angels, who always behold his face, but to men: no man hath seen him corporeally with the eyes of his body, though intellectually with the eyes of the understanding, when enlightened; not in his essence and nature, which is infinite and incomprehensible, but in his works of creation, providence, and grace; nor immediately, but mediately, in and through Christ, in whom he gives the light of the knowledge of the glory of his person and perfections; and this not perfectly now, but in the other state, when the saints shall see him face to face. But chiefly the Father is said to be invisible, because he did not appear to Old Testament saints; as his voice was never heard, so his shape was never seen; he never assumed any visible form; but whenever any voice was heard, or shape seen, it was the second person that appeared, the Son of God, who is here said to be his "image", and that, as he is the Son of God; in which sense he is the natural, essential, and eternal image of his Father, an eternal one, perfect and complete, and in which he takes infinite complacency and delight: this designs more than a shadow and representation, or than bare similitude and likeness; it includes sameness of nature and perfections; ascertains the personality of the Son, his distinction from the Father, whose image he is; and yet implies no inferiority, as the following verses clearly show, since all that the Father hath are his. Philo, the Jew (f), often speaks of the  or Word of God, as the image of God. Also, this may be understood of him as Mediator, in whom, as such, is a most glorious display of the love, grace, and mercy of God, of his holiness and righteousness, of his truth and faithfulness, and of his power and wisdom: <p>the firstborn of every creature; not the first of the creation, or the first creature God made; for all things in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> are said to be created by him, and therefore he himself can never be a creature; nor is he the first in the new creation, for the apostle in the context is speaking of the old creation, and not the new: but the sense either is, that he was begotten of the Father in a manner inconceivable and inexpressible by men, before any creatures were in being; or that he is the "first Parent", or bringer forth of every creature into being, as the word will bear to be rendered, if instead of  we read  which is no more than changing the place of the accent, and may be very easily ventured upon, as is done by an ancient writer (g), who observes, that the word is used in this sense by Homer, and is the same as  "first Parent", and  "first Creator"; and the rather this may be done, seeing the accents were all added since the apostle's days, and especially seeing it makes his reasoning, in the following verses, appear with much more beauty, strength, and force: he is the first Parent of every creature, "for by him were all things created", &amp;c. <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>, or it may be understood of Christ, as the King, Lord, and Governor of all creatures; being God's firstborn, he is heir of all things, the right of government belongs to him; he is higher than the kings of the earth, or the angels in heaven, the highest rank of creatures, being the Creator and upholder of all, as the following words show; so the Jews make the word "firstborn" to be synonymous with the word "king", and explain it by , "a great one", and "a prince" (h); see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>. <p>(f) De Mund.

The Greek word (<span class="ital">eicôn</span>) occurs often in Biblical Greek, most frequently (in O.T.) as a translation of the Hebrew <span class="ital">tselem</span>. Usage shews that on the whole it connotes not only similarity but also “<span class="ital">representation</span> (as a <span class="ital">derived</span> likeness) and <span class="ital">manifestation</span>” (Grimm’s <span class="ital">N. T. Lexicon</span>, ed. Thayer; and see Lightfoot’s note, or rather essay, here). An instructive passage for study of the word is <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-1.htm" title="For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.">Hebrews 10:1</a>, where it is opposed to “<span class="ital">shadow</span>,” and plainly means “<span class="ital">the things themselves, as seen</span>.” Thus the Lord Christ, the mystery of His Person and Natures, is not only a Being resembling God, but God Manifest. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?">John 14:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Christian antiquity has ever regarded the expression ‘image of God’ as denoting the eternal Son’s perfect equality with the Father in respect of His substance, power, and eternity … The Son is the Father’s Image in all things save only in being the Father” (Ellicott; with reff. <span class="ital">inter alia</span> to Hilary <span class="ital">de Synodis</span>, § 73; Athan. <span class="ital">contra Arian</span>. i. 20, 21).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the invisible God</span>] For the same word see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-17.htm" title="Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.">1 Timothy 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-27.htm" title="By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.">Hebrews 11:27</a>. And cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-37.htm" title="And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.">John 5:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-16.htm" title="Who only has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach to; whom no man has seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.">1 Timothy 6:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-20.htm" title="If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?">1 John 4:20</a>. This assertion of the Invisibility of the Father has regard to the <span class="ital">manifesting</span> function of the Image, the Son. See Lightfoot here. The Christian Fathers generally (not universally) took it otherwise, holding that the “Image” here refers wholly to the Son in His Godhead, which is as invisible as that of the Father, being indeed the same. But the word “Image” by usage tends to the thought of vision, in some sort; and the collocation of it here with “the Invisible” brings this out with a certain emphasis. Not that the reference of the “Image” here is directly or primarily to our Lord’s visible Body of the Incarnation, but to His being, in all ages and spheres of created existence, the Manifester of the Father to created intelligences. His being this was, so to speak, the basis and antecedent of His gracious coming in the flesh, to be “seen with the eyes” of men on earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1 John 1:1</a>). In the words of St Basil (<span class="ital">Epist.</span> xxxviii. 8, quoted by Lightfoot) the creature “views the Unbegotten Beauty in the Begotten.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the firstborn of every creature</span>] Better perhaps, <span class="bld">Firstborn of all creation</span> (Lightfoot and R.V.), or, with a very slight paraphrase, <span class="bld">Firstborn over all creation</span>; standing to it in the relation of priority of existence and supremacy of inherited right. So, to borrow a most inadequate analogy, the heir of an hereditary throne might be described as “firstborn to, or over, all the realm.” The word “<span class="ital">creature</span>” (from the (late) Latin <span class="ital">creatura</span>) here probably, as certainly in Romans 8, means “creation” as a whole; a meaning to which the Greek word <span class="ital">inclines</span> in usage, rather than to that of “a creature” (which latter Ellicott and Alford however adopt). See Lightfoot’s note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Firstborn:</span>”—cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm" title="Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.">Psalm 89:27</a>; and the Palestinian Jewish application, thence derived, of the title “Firstborn” to the Messiah. A similar word was used of the mysterious “Logos” among the Alexandrian Jews, as shewn in the writings of St Paul’s contemporary, Philo. Studied in its usage, and in these connexions, the word thus denotes (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">Priority of existence</span>, so that the Son appears as antecedent to the created Universe, and therefore as belonging to the eternal Order of being (see the following context); (<span class="ital">b</span>) <span class="ital">Lordship over</span> “all creation,” by this right of eternal primogeniture. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm" title="Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.">Psalm 89:27</a>, and cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Of all creation:</span>”—so lit. The force of the Greek genitive, in connexion with the word “<span class="ital">first</span>” (as here “<span class="ital">first</span>born”), may be either <span class="ital">partitive</span>, so that the Son would be described as first <span class="ital">of</span> created things, or so to speak <span class="ital">comparative</span> (see a case exactly in point, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>, Greek), so that He would be described as first, or antecedent, <span class="ital">in regard of</span> created things.

For the Logos (Word) underlying the passage, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>. Image is more than likeness which may be superficial and incidental. It implies a prototype, and embodies the essential verity of its prototype. Compare in the form of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a> (note), and the effulgence of the Father's glory, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>.

Thus is brought out the idea of manifestation which lies in image. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-14.htm">Revelation 13:14</a>.<p>The first born of every creature (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., the first-born of all creation. For first-born, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>; for creation, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>. As image points to revelation, so first-born points to eternal preexistence. Even the Rev. is a little ambiguous, for we must carefully avoid any suggestion that Christ was the first of created things, which is contradicted by the following words: in Him were all things created. The true sense is, born before the creation. Compare before all things, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>. This fact of priority implies sovereignty. He is exalted above all thrones, etc., and all things are unto (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;) Him, as they are elsewhere declared to be unto God.
