In the Ephesian Epistle the treatment of the subject is fuller, and in one point more comprehensive, viz., in bringing out emphatically the unity of all, Jews and Gentiles alike, with one another, as well as their unity with Christ. But, on the other hand, this passage involves deeper and more mysterious teaching in this—that it includes in the reconciliation by the blood of Christ, not merely all humanity, but “all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven.” This is, indeed, only a fuller exposition of the truth that “God was in Christ reconciling the world (the <span class= "ital">kosmos</span>) to Himself” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm" title="To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.">2Corinthians 5:19</a>); and that “the whole creation waiteth,” “in constant expectation,” “for the manifestation of the sons of God,” and “shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19-21</a>). But it is couched in more distinct and striking terms, opening to us a glimpse of the infinite scope, not merely of our Lord’s Mediatorship, but of His Atonement, which, while it almost bewilders, yet satisfies the thoughtful understanding, and more than satisfies an adoring faith. As there seems to be a physical unity in the universe, if we may believe the guesses of science, so, says Holy Scripture, there is a moral and spiritual unity also in Jesus Christ.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21-23</a> apply this truth of the Mediatorial work of the Lord Jesus Christ to the especial case of the Colossians.

Let us adore these mysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And having made peace - Margin, "making." The Greek will bear either. The meaning is, that by his atonement he produces reconciliation between those who were alienated from each other; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>. It does not mean here that he had actually effected peace by his death, but that he had laid the foundation for it; he had done that which would secure it.<p>By the blood of his cross - By his blood shed on the cross. That blood, making atonement for sin, was the means of making reconciliation between God and man. On the meaning of the word "blood," as used in this connection, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>.<p>By him to reconcile all things to himself - On the meaning of the word reconcile, see the <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-24.htm">Matthew 5:24</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>, note, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18</a>, note. When it is said that "it pleased the Father by Christ to reconcile all things to himself," the declaration must be understood with some limitation.<p>(1) it relates only to those things which are in heaven and earth - for those only are specified. Nothing is said of the inhabitants of hell, whether fallen angels, or the spirits of wicked men who are there.<p>(2) it cannot mean that all things are actually reconciled - for that never has been true. Multitudes on earth have remained alienated from God, and have lived and died his enemies.<p>(3) it can mean then, only, that he had executed a plan that was adapted to this; that if fairly and properly applied, the blood of the cross was fitted to secure entire reconciliation between heaven and earth. There was no enemy which it was not fitted to reconcile to God; there was no guilt, now producing alienation, which it could not wash away.<p>Whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven - That is, to produce harmony between the things in heaven and in earth; so that all things shall be reconciled to him, or so that there shalt be harmony between heaven and earth. The meaning is not, that "the things in heaven" were alienated from God, but that there was alienation in the universe which affected heaven, and the object was to produce again universal concord and love. Substantially the same sentiment is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>; see the notes at that verse. Much has been written on the meaning of this expression, and a great variety of opinions have been entertained of it. It is best, always, unless necessity require a different interpretation, to take words in their usual signification. If that rule be adopted here," things in heaven" will refer to God and the angels, and perhaps may include the principles of the divine government, "Things on earth," will embrace men, and the various things on earth which are now at variance with God and with heaven. Between these, it is designed to produce harmony by the blood of the cross, or by the atonement. As in heaven nothing is wrong; as it is not desirable that anything should he changed there, all the change that is to take place in order to produce reconciliation, is to be on the part of men and the things of this world. The only effect of the blood of the atonement on the "things" of heaven in effecting the reconciliation is, to render it consistent for God to be at peace with sinners. The effect on earth is, to dispose the sinner to a willingness to be reconciled; to lead him to lay aside his enmity; to change his heart, and to effect a change in the views and principles prevailing on earth which are now at variance with God and his government. When this shall be done there will be harmony between heaven and earth, and an alienated world will be brought into conformity with the laws and government of the Creator. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. The Greek order is, "And through Him (Christ) to reconcile again completely (see on [2404]Eph 2:16) all things (Greek, 'the whole universe of things') unto Himself (unto God the Father, 2Co 5:19), having made peace (God the Father having made peace) through the blood of His (Christ's) cross," that is, shed by Christ on the cross: the price and pledge of our reconciliation with God. The Scripture phrase, "God reconciles man to Himself," implies that He takes away by the blood of Jesus the barrier which God's justice interposes against man's being in union with God (compare Note, see on [2405]Ro 5:10; 2Co 5:18). So the Septuagint, 1Sa 29:4, "Wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master," that is, reconcile his master unto him by appeasing his wrath. So Mt 5:23, 24.<p>by him&#8212;"through Him" (the instrumental agent in the new creation, as in the original creation): emphatically repeated, to bring the person of Christ, as the Head of both creations alike, into prominence.<p>things in earth &#8230; in heaven&#8212;Good angels, in one sense, do not need reconciliation to God; fallen angels are excluded from it (Jude 6). But probably redemption has effects on the world of spirits unknown to us. Of course, His reconciling us, and His reconciling them, must be by a different process, as He took not on Him the nature of angels, so as to offer a propitiation for them. But the effect of redemption on them, as He is their Head as well as ours, is that they are thereby brought nearer God, and so gain an increase of blessedness [Alford], and larger views of the love and wisdom of God (Eph 3:10). All creation subsists in Christ, all creation is therefore affected by His propitiation: sinful creation is strictly "reconciled" from its enmity; sinless creation, comparatively distant from His unapproachable purity (Job 4:18; 15:15; 25:5), is lifted into nearer participation of Him, and in this wider sense is reconciled. Doubtless, too, man's fall, following on Satan's fall, is a segment of a larger circle of evil, so that the remedy of the former affects the standing of angels, from among whom Satan and his host fell. Angels thereby having seen the magnitude of sin, and the infinite cost of redemption, and the exclusion of the fallen angels from it, and the inability of any creature to stand morally in his own strength, are now put beyond the reach of falling. Thus Bacon's definition of Christ's Headship holds good: "The Head of redemption to man; the Head of preservation to angels." Some conjecture that Satan, when unfallen, ruled this earth and the pre-Adamic animal kingdom: hence his malice against man who succeeded to the lordship of this earth and its animals, and hence, too, his assumption of the form of a serpent, the subtlest of the animal tribes. Lu 19:38 states expressly "peace in heaven" as the result of finished redemption, as "peace on earth" was the result of its beginning at Jesus' birth (Lu 2:14). Bengel explains the reconciliation to be that of not only God, but also angels, estranged from men because of man's enmity against God. Eph 1:10 accords with this: This is true, but only part of the truth: so Alford's view also is but part of the truth. An actual reconciliation or restoration of peace in heaven, as well as on earth, is expressed by Paul. As long as that blood of reconciliation was not actually shed, which is opposed (Zec 3:8, 9) to the accusations of Satan, but was only in promise, Satan could plead his right against men before God day and night (Job 1:6; Re 12:10); hence he was in heaven till the ban on man was broken (compare Lu 10:18). So here; the world of earth and heaven owe to Christ alone the restoration of harmony after the conflict and the subjugation of all things under one Head (compare Heb 11:23). Sin introduced discord not only on earth, but also in heaven, by the fall of demons; it brought into the abodes of holy angels, though not positive, yet privative loss, a retardation of their highest and most perfect development, harmonious gradation, and perfect consummation. Angels were no more able than men by themselves to overcome the peace disturbers, and cast out the devils; it is only "by," or "through Him," and "the blood of His cross," that peace was restored even in heaven; it is only after Christ has obtained the victory fully and legally, that Michael (Re 12:7-10) and his angels can cast out of heaven Satan and his demons (compare Col 2:15). Thus the point of Paul's argument against angel-worship is, that angels themselves, like men, wholly depend on Christ, the sole and true object of worship [Auberlen].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some, from the Greek, would (not have that clause we read in a parenthesis to come next the copulative <span class="ital">and, </span> but) have it: And by himself he should reconcile unto himself (in or to himself) all things, (having made or obtained peace through the blood of his cross), I say, &c.

This depends upon the preceding verse, and is to be connected with that phrase in it, it pleased the Father, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>; and the sense is, that it was the good will and pleasure of God from all eternity, as to lay up all fulness in Christ for his chosen people, so to reconcile them to himself by him; and which is another reason why Christ is, and ought to be considered as the head of the church, whose reconciliation he has procured, and why he ought to have the chief place in all things, and among all persons. Reconciliation supposes a former state of amity and friendship, and in such an one man was originally with God; and a breach of that friendship, which was made and issued in real enmity in the heart of man; and also a restoration to friendship again: and it is to be understood not of a reconciliation of God to men, which the Scriptures nowhere speak of, but of men to God; and is a reconciliation of them, not to the love of God, which his elect always shared in, but to the justice of God, offended by the transgression of a righteous law; and is indeed properly a reconciliation, atonement, and satisfaction for their sins, and so of their persons, and whereby all the perfections of God are reconciled to and agree with each other in the salvation of such sinners: now this takes its first rise from God the Father; it is owing to his sovereign good will and pleasure; he took the first step towards it; he knew what a state of enmity and rebellion his people would fall into; his thoughts ran upon their peace and reconciliation from everlasting; he called a council of peace about it, and in it drew the model of it; he entered into a covenant of peace with his Son, and, in consequence of it, sent him in the fulness of time to effect it, laying on him the chastisement of their peace; it was his pleasure that this affair of reconciliation should be brought about, not by the means of angels, in whom he could put no such trust and confidence, and who, though they rejoice at peace being made on earth, could never have effected it; nor that it should be done by men, who have no knowledge of the way of it, no inclination to it, nor power to make it; but "by him", his Son Jesus Christ, whom he appointed and called to this work, and sent to do it; and who is therefore, in prophecy, before this reconciliation was actually made, styled "Shiloh", the Prince of peace, and the peace: and this, when made, was made "to himself"; meaning either to Christ, in whom all the elect were gathered together, as in one head, and were reconciled in one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, through him; or rather to God the Father, to whom they were enemies, yea, enmity itself, and to whom the satisfaction and atonement were made; it being his law that was broken, and his justice that was injured, and to whom they are always in Scripture said to be reconciled; though not to the exclusion of the Son and Spirit, the one God with the Father: moreover, the sense of this phrase may be, that the reconciliation of the elect made by Christ, in a way of full satisfaction to law and justice, is to the glory of God, the glory of all his perfections; as of his grace and mercy, wisdom, power, and faithfulness, so of his righteousness and holiness: the means by which Christ has enacted it are, his sacrifice, sufferings, and death, expressed in the following clause, <p>having made peace through the blood of his cross. This was what man could not do, what Christ was appointed and sent to do, and what he was every way qualified for as God and man; as man he had blood to shed, and could make reconciliation for sin in the nature which had sinned, and, as God, could draw nigh to his Father, and treat with him about terms of peace, and perform them; and so a fit daysman and Mediator between, God and man: this peace he has made by his "blood", that is, by the shedding of it, by his death as a sacrifice, which he underwent on the cross; partly to denote the shame, and chiefly to signify the curse he endured in the room of his people: all which shows the malignant nature of sin, the strictness of justice, and that peace is made in a way of full satisfaction, is upon honourable terms, will be lasting, as it is joyful, being attended with a train of blessings: <p>by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven: by which are intended not the whole universe and fabric of the world, all creatures and things, animate and inanimate, rational and irrational, which have been cursed for the sin of man, and have proved unfriendly to him, but, in consequence of redemption and reconciliation by Christ, will, as some think, in the time of the restitution of all things, be restored to their former state, and to their friendly use to mankind; nor elect men and elect angels, and their reconciliation together, for the apostle is not speaking of the reconciling of these things together, but of the reconciling of them to God, which though it is true of elect men, is not of elect angels, who never fell, and though they have confirming grace, yet not reconciling grace from Christ, which they never needed; nor Jews and Gentiles, for though it is true that God was in Christ reconciling the world of the Gentiles, as well as of the Jews to himself, and the chosen of God among both are actually reconciled to God by the death of Christ, yet the one are never called things in heaven, or the other things on earth, in distinction from, and opposition to each other; but rather all the elect of God are here meant, the family of God in heaven and in earth; all the saints that were then in heaven, when actual reconciliation was made by the blood of Christ, and who went thither upon the foot of peace, reconciliation, and redemption, to be made by his sacrifice and death; and all the chosen ones that were or should be on the face of the earth, until the end of time; all these were reconciled to God by Christ: and then the apostle proceeds particularly to mention the Colossians, as also being instances of this grace, good will, and pleasure of God by Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> all things unto himself; by him, <i>I say</i>, whether <i>they be</i> things in earth, or things in heaven.</span><p>(9) Now he teaches how Christ executed that office which his Father gave and commanded to him, that is, by suffering the death of the cross (which was joined with the curse of God) according to his decree, that by this sacrifice he might reconcile to his Father all men, both those who believed in the Christ to come, and were already under this hope gathered into heaven, as well as those who should upon the earth believe in him afterwards.

The considerations which regulate the correct understanding of the passage are: (1) that <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> may not in any way be restricted (this has been appropriately urged by Usteri, and especially by Huther); that it consequently cannot be referred either merely to <span class="ital">intelligent beings</span> generally (the usual view), or to <span class="ital">men</span> (Cornelius a Lapide, Heinrichs, Baumgarten-Crusius, and others), especially the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span> (Olshausen), or to the “universam <span class="ital">ecclesiam</span>” (Beza), but is, according to the context (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a> ff.), simply to be taken as quite <span class="ital">general: the whole of that which exists</span> (has been created); (2) that the <span class="ital">reconciling subject</span> is here not Christ (Hofmann, in accordance with his incorrect reference of <span class="greekheb">εὐδόκησε</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>), but <span class="ital">God</span>, who <span class="ital">through Christ</span> (<span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span>) reconciled all things; (3) that consequently <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλάξαι</span> cannot be meant of <span class="ital">the transforming of the misrelation between the world and Christ into a good relation</span> (Hofmann), and just as little of the reconciliation of all things <span class="ital">with one another</span>, of the removal of <span class="ital">mutual</span> hostility among the <span class="ital">constituent elements</span> composing <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>, but only of the universal reconciliation <span class="ital">with the God who is hostile to sin,</span>[50] as is clearly evident from the application to the readers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>. The only correct sense therefore is, <span class="ital">that the entire universe has been reconciled with God through Christ</span>. But <span class="ital">how far?</span> In answering this question, which cannot be disposed of by speculation beyond the range of Scripture as to the having entered into the finite and having returned again to the infinite (Usteri), nor by the idea imported into <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλ</span>. of <span class="ital">gathering up into the unity of absolute final aim</span> (Baur, <span class="ital">neut. Theol</span>. p. 257), the following considerations are of service: (<span class="ital">a</span>) The original harmony, which in the state of innocence subsisted between God and the whole creation, was annulled by sin, which first obtained mastery over a portion of the angels, and in consequence of this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>), by means of the transgression of Adam, over all mankind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>). Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>. (<span class="ital">b</span>) Not only had sinful mankind now become alienated from God by sin and brought upon themselves His hostility (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a>), but also the whole of the non-rational creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a> ff.) was affected by this relation, and given up by God to <span class="greekheb">ματαιότης</span> and <span class="greekheb">δουλεία τῆς φθορᾶς</span> (see on Rom. <span class="ital">l.c</span>.). (<span class="ital">c</span>) Indeed, even the world of heavenly spirits had lost its harmony with God as it originally existed, since a portion of the angels—those that had fallen—formed the kingdom of the devil, in antagonism to God, and became forfeited to the wrath of God for the everlasting punishment which is prepared for the devil and his angels. (<span class="ital">d</span>) But in Christ, by means of His <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span>, through which God made peace (<span class="greekheb">εἰρηνοποιήσας κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), the reconciliation of the whole has taken place, in virtue of the blotting out, thereby effected, of the curse of sin. Thus not merely has the <span class="ital">fact</span> effecting the reconciliation as its <span class="ital">causa meritoria</span> taken place, but the realization of the <span class="ital">universal reconciliation itself</span> is also <span class="ital">entered upon</span>, although it is not yet <span class="ital">completed</span>, but down to the time of the Parousia is only in course of <span class="ital">development</span>, inasmuch, namely, as in the present <span class="greekheb">αἰών</span> the believing portion of mankind is indeed in possession of the reconciliation, but the unreconciled unbelievers (the tares among the wheat) are not yet separated; inasmuch, further, as the non-intelligent creation still remains in its state of corruption occasioned by sin (Romans 8); and lastly, inasmuch as until the Parousia even the angelic world sees the kingdom of the devil which has issued from it still—although the demoniac powers have been already vanquished by the atoning death, and have become the object of divine triumph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>)—not annulled, and still in dangerous operation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>) against the Christian church. But through the Parousia the reconciliation of the whole which has been effected in Christ will reach its consummation, when the unbelieving portion of mankind will be separated and consigned to Gehenna, the whole creation in virtue of the Palingenesia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>) will be transformed into its original perfection, and the new heaven and the new earth will be constituted as the dwelling of <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-13.htm" title="Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwells righteousness.">2 Peter 3:13</a>) and of the <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> of the children of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-21.htm" title="Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.">Romans 8:21</a>); while the demoniac portion of the angelic world will be removed from the sphere of the new world, and cast into hell. Accordingly, in the whole creation there will no longer be anything alienated from God and object of His hostility, but <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> will be in harmony and reconciled with Him; and God Himself, to whom Christ gives back the regency which He has hitherto exercised, will become the only Ruler and All in All (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>). This collective reconciliation, although its consummation will not occur until the Parousia, is yet justly designated by the <span class="ital">aorist</span> infinitive <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλάξαι</span>, because to the telic conception of God in the <span class="greekheb">εὐδόκησε</span> it was present as <span class="ital">one moment in conception.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The angels also</span> are necessarily included in <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> (comp. subsequently, <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς</span>); and in this case—seeing that a reconciliation of the angels who had not fallen, who are holy and minister to Christ (Hahn, <span class="ital">Theol. d. N. T.</span> I. p. 269 ff.), considered in themselves as individuals, cannot be spoken of, and is nowhere spoken of in the N. T.[51]—it is to be observed that the angels are to be conceived <span class="ital">according to category</span>, in so far, namely, as the hostile relation of God towards the fallen angels affected the angelic world viewed as a whole. The original normal relation between God and this higher order of spirits is no longer existing, so long as the kingdom of demons in antagonism to God still subsists—which has had its powers broken no doubt already by the death of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a> f; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>), but will undergo at length utter separation—a result which is to be expected in the new transformation of the world at the Parousia. The idea of reconciliation is therefore, in conformity with the manner of popular discourse, and according to the variety of the several objects included in <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>, meant partly in an immediate sense (in reference to mankind), partly in a mediate sense (in reference to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΤΊΣΙς</span></span></span> affected by man’s sin, Romans 8, and to the angelic world affected by its partial fall);[52] the idea of <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλάξαι</span>, in presence of the all-embracing <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>, is as it were of an <span class="ital">elastic</span> nature.[53] At the same time, however, <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλ</span>. is not to be made <span class="ital">equivalent</span> (Melanchthon, Grotius, Cornelius a Lapide, Flatt, Bähr, Bleek, and others) to <span class="greekheb">ἀποκεφαλαιώσασθαι</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>), which is rather the <span class="ital">sequel</span> of the former; nor is it to be conceived as merely <span class="ital">completing</span> the harmony of the good angels (who are not to be thought <span class="ital">absolutely</span> pure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-18.htm" title="Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:">Job 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm" title="Behold, he puts no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight.">Job 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-18.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.">Mark 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-3.htm" title="Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>) with God (de Wette), and not in the strict sense therefore <span class="ital">restoring</span> it—an interpretation which violates the meaning of the word. Calvin, nevertheless, has already so conceived the matter, introducing, moreover, the element—foreign to the literal sense—of <span class="ital">confirmation</span> in righteousness: “quum creaturae sint, <span class="ital">extra lapsus periculum</span> non essent, nisi Christi gratia fuissent <span class="ital">confirmati</span>.” According to Ritschl, in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. Deutsche Theol</span>. 1863, p. 522 f., Paul intends to refer to the angels that had been active in the <span class="ital">law-giving on Sinai</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; Ps. 67:18, LXX.), to whom he attributes “a deviation from God’s plan of salvation.” But this latter idea cannot be made good either by <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>, or by <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law?

To this verse <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16</a>, are partially parallel. It supplies the basis for the Son’s pre-eminence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>) in His reconciling death.—<span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span>: through the Son.—<span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλάξαι τὰ πάντα εἰς αὐτόν</span>. The choice of <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατ</span>. instead of the more usual <span class="greekheb">καταλλ</span>. is for the sake of strengthening the idea, and by insisting on the completeness of the reconciliation accomplished to exclude all thought that reconciliation by angels is needed to supplement that made by Christ. The reconciliation implies previous estrangement. It is the universal sweep of this passage that makes it at once fascinating and mysterious. Numerous expedients have been devised by exegetes to avoid the plain meaning of the words. The natural sense is that this reconciliation embraces the whole universe, and affects both things in heaven and things on the earth, and that peace is made between them and God (or Christ). The point which creates difficulty is the assertion that angels were thus reconciled. Some have evaded this by interpreting <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> of the things in heaven below the angels and those on earth below man. It might be possible to parallel the latter reconciliation with Paul’s prophecy of the deliverance of animate and inanimate nature (excluding man) from the bondage of corruption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God....">Romans 8:19-23</a>). But the two are not identical, for one is and the other is not eschatological, and reconciliation is not deliverance from the bondage of corruption. And this helps us little to explain what the reconciliation of all things in heaven is. Nor is any such limitation legitimate; on the contrary, it is precisely in the opposite direction that any limitation would have to be made; for in its full sense reconciliation can only be of beings endowed with moral and spiritual nature. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:...">Colossians 1:16-17</a> angelic powers are explicitly included in <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>. It is plain that <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸν</span> excludes the view that a reconciliation of angels and men is intended. This is so even if with Chrysostom and others (including apparently Abbott) we make <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γῆς</span> and <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐραν</span>. depend on <span class="greekheb">εἰρηνοπ</span>. For this still leaves unexplained <span class="greekheb">ἀποκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πάντα εἰς αὐτόν</span>, which makes the reference to angels undeniable. Bengel’s note, “Certum est angelos, Dei amicos, fuisse inimicos hominum Deo infensorum,” may be perfectly true. But it is irrelevant here, for only by forcing the words can <span class="greekheb">εἰρηνοπ</span> … <span class="greekheb">οὐραν</span>. be regarded as other than epexegetical of the preceding clause, and in particular <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γῆς</span> and <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐραν</span>. as a resolution of <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>. Abbott’s suggestion that <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐραν</span>. may be inhabitants of other worlds may be true, though for Paul the thought is far-fetched, but does nothing towards excluding the angels. He urges that <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς</span> is not necessarily equivalent to “in heaven”. But not only did Jewish angelology place the angels in the heavens, but Paul did so too, and has done so only just before in this passage, defining <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν τοῖς οὐραν</span>. as the various orders of angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>). Further, not only is this exclusion of the angels from the scope of reconciliation inconsistent with the terms of the passage, it omits a very important point in Paul’s polemic. To the angels the false teachers probably ascribed the function of procuring the reconciliation of men with God. (<span class="ital">Cf.</span> Enoch xv. 2, “And go, say to the watchers of heaven, who have sent thee to intercede for them: you should intercede for men, and not men for you”.) How effective is Paul’s reply that these angels needed reconciliation themselves! Assuming, then, that angels are included among those reconciled, and that this is also referred to in the words “having made peace through the blood of His cross,” the question arises, What did Paul mean by this? Meyer says that in consequence of the fall of the evil angels the angelic order as a whole was affected by the hostile relation of God to them, and the original relation will be fully restored when the evil angels are finally cast into hell. But apart from the speculative nature of this explanation, and the injustice it imputes to God, the reference is certainly not eschatological. Godet lays stress on <span class="greekheb">εἰ αὐτὸν</span>, and suggests that the reconciliation is not to God but with reference to God. He thinks that the passing over of sins by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm" title="Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;">Romans 3:25</a>) might cause the angels, who had been mediators in the giving of the law, difficulties as to the Divine righteousness. This was met and removed by the cross, which revealed God’s attitude to sin and reconciled them to His government. We do not know that the angels needed this vindication, which, of course, it was a function of Christ’s death to give, though it is possible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1 Peter 1:12</a>). But this interpretation seems to be excluded by the explanation of reconciliation as making peace. And <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸν</span> was probably chosen instead of <span class="greekheb">αὐτῷ</span> on account of <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸν</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>), and because it was stronger and expressed the thought of God or Christ as the goal. The explanation that the angels were confirmed, and thus made unable to fall, is altogether inadequate. Harless, Oltramare and others admit a reconciliation of men and angels to God, but without asserting that <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐρ</span>. needed reconciliation. Wherever it was needed Christ effected it. But Paul’s division of <span class="greekheb">τὰ π</span>. into two categories marked by <span class="greekheb">εἴτε</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἴτε</span> shows that the statement has reference not simply to these classes taken together as a whole, but to each taken singly. Alford, in his suggestive note, after saying that such a reconciliation as that between man and God is not to be thought of, since Christ did not take on Him the seed of angels or pay any propitiatory penalty in the root of their nature, gives as his interpretation “all creation subsists in Christ: all creation therefore is affected by His act of propitiation: sinful creation is, in the strictest sense, <span class="ital">reconciled</span> from being at enmity: sinless creation, ever at a distance from His unapproachable purity, is lifted into nearer participation and higher glorification of Him, and is thus <span class="ital">reconciled</span>, though not in the strictest, yet in a very intelligible and allowable sense”. Unfortunately this cannot be accepted, for the strict is the only allowable sense. But it is on the right lines, and indicates the direction in which a solution must be sought. This, as several recent scholars have urged (Kl[9], Gess, Everling and others), is through taking account of the Biblical and Jewish doctrine of angels. That the angels are divided into the sharply separated classes of sinless and demoniacal is a view on which this passage remains inexplicable. Nor is it the Old Testament or the Jewish doctrine, or, it may be added, the doctrine of Paul. Perhaps we need not, with Gess, think of an intermediate class, or, with Ritschl, of the angels of the Law. To Jewish thought angels stood in the closest relations with men, and were regarded as sharing a moral responsibility for their acts. The angelic princes of earthly kingdoms in Daniel, and the angels of the Churches in the Apocalypse, are Biblical examples of this. A large number of Pauline passages harmonise with the view that the angelic world needed a reconciliation. The detailed proof of this cannot be given here; it belongs to the discussion of the angelology of the Epistle. (See <span class="ital">Introd.</span>, section ii.) But if the angels needed it, how could it be effected through the blood of the cross? It is not enough to answer with Haupt that the reconciliation of men affected the angels who were closely united with them. A direct effect seems to be intended, and the difficulty is that stated by Holtzmann, that with the flesh all capacity is absent from the angels of Paul, to share in the saving effects of the death of God’s Son, which was made possible through the assumption of the flesh, and in which sin in the flesh is condemned. In answer to it these considerations may be urged. The Son is Head of the angels, as He is Head of humanity; therefore His acts had an effect on them independently of their effect on men. His death must not be narrowly conceived as physical only, as the destruction of the material flesh. It was the destruction of the sinful principle; and therefore is independent in its effects of the possession of material bodies by those whom it saves. And this cannot be set aside by the fact that Paul uses such a physical term as blood of the cross, for the death of Christ was surely more to him than a mere physical incident. So far, then, as the angel world was affected by sin, it needed reconciliation, and received it in the atoning and sin-destroying death of Christ its Head. That in this reconciliation evil angels are not included is clear from the fact that Paul does not regard it as having had effect on them corresponding to that on men. Lueken points out that Paul adds “through Him” to the words “through the blood of His cross,” and refers the latter to the reconciliation of men and the former to that of angels, so that they are simply said to be reconciled through Christ. But the <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span> is an emphatic resumption of <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span> at the beginning of the verse.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτόν</span>. It is uncertain whether this should be referred to God or Christ. The former is possible, for <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> may be reflexive, and reconciliation is usually to God (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16</a>, also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;...">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm" title="For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.">Romans 5:10</a>). We should also have expected <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς αὐτόν</span> if Christ had been meant. On the other hand, the reference to Christ is favoured by the fact that elsewhere in this passage <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> always refers to Christ, and by the parallel with <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> … <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span> … <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτόν</span>. Decision is difficult; it is perhaps safest to let the Pauline usage determine the reference, and interpret “unto Himself”.—<span class="greekheb">εἰρηνοποιήσας</span>. In Ephesians great emphasis is laid on the peace between Jew and Gentile, established by the cross, an emphasis quite to be expected where the unity of the Church is the leading thought; but not to be found here, for the peace is obviously between God on the one side and men and angels on the other; besides which the thought would have no relevance in this connexion.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αἵματος τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σταυροῦ αὐτοῦ</span>. The combination of the two terms is perhaps for the sake of insisting on the historical fact of the reconciling death against the tendency to seek peace with God through angelic mediators.—<span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γῆς</span>, probably governed by <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατ</span>., rather than <span class="greekheb">εἰρηνοπ</span>., since it and the companion phrase seem to be epexegetical of <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[9] Klöpper.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">having made peace</span>] Between Himself, the Holy Judge and King, and His subjects.

While the Crucified Son is the immediate Agent, the Father “who spared not His own Son” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm" title="He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?">Romans 8:32</a>), because He “loved the world” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm" title="For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.">John 3:16</a>), is the remoter Agent, Eternal Source of all salvation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">through the blood of his cross</span>] The Cross of the Son. Here first the sacred Atoning Death is explicitly mentioned; its fact and its mode.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">The blood:</span>”—i.e. the Death, viewed as the Ransom-price. Some expositors find in “<span class="ital">the blood</span> of Christ” (in the N.T. generally) a reference different from that of “<span class="ital">the death</span> of Christ,” connecting it rather with life than with death; with surrender to God, and impartation to man, of the Lord’s vivifying life rather than with the immolation of His life as (because of His undertaking for us) forfeited to the Law. But certainly in this passage, at least, the thought not of vivification but of propitiation is prominent. See the notes just below.—On the subject of “the Blood of Christ” generally the Editor may refer to his <span class="ital">Outlines of Christian Doctrine</span>, pp. 85, &c., and to <span class="ital">The Blood of the New Covenant</span>, by W. S. Smith, D.D., Bishop of Sydney.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by him</span>] Christ. Lit., <span class="bld">through Him</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to reconcile</span>] The Greek verb here rendered “<span class="ital">reconcile</span>” occurs elsewhere (in exactly the same form) only in the next verse and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16</a>. Its form emphasizes the thought of conciliating <span class="ital">back again</span>, after breach of loyalty or amity. Ideally, the whole Church and each individual was (in Adam unfallen) originally at peace with God; then came revolt, and now <span class="ital">re</span>-conciliation. On such an ideal view (very different from that of personal conscious experience) see our note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm" title="That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:">Ephesians 2:12</a> (“<span class="ital">being aliens</span>.”)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A simpler form of the same verb occurs e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm" title="For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.">Romans 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.">1 Corinthians 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-18.htm" title="And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation;...">2 Corinthians 5:18-20</a>. The main notion of both verbs is the propitiation of an alienated superior, so that he accepts offending inferiors, who are thus and then “reconciled” to him. And the superior “reconciles them” so far as he acts on the provided propitiation. Here the Father “reconciles” by constituting His Son the all-sufficient and all-acceptable Lord of Peace. See further our note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all things</span>] For similar language cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a> (“<span class="ital">Elias … restoreth all things</span>;”) <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm" title="Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.">Acts 3:21</a>, (“<span class="ital">the times of the restoration of all things which God spake by … His holy prophets;</span>” i.e. the bringing back of Paradise, and of the Theocracy, in their heavenly and eternal reality). The word “<span class="ital">all</span>” is at once glorified and limited by the words, in apposition, just below, “<span class="ital">whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens:</span>” see note there. The human and angelic “worlds” are the objects of the “reconciliation” in view here; not “all things” apart from those limits, but “all things” within them. See the closely parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto himself</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">unto Him</span>.” But the reflexive English pronoun rightly represents the Greek non-reflexive, in the light of N.T. <span class="ital">usage</span>. See Lightfoot’s note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Here the “reconciliation” of the “all things” is seen to be not (as some expositors, ancient and modern, take it) a reconciliation to one another, so that e.g. angels, alienated by man’s sin, shall again be perfectly harmonized with man. It is a reconciliation of the “all things” <span class="ital">to God</span>, in the way of propitiation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by him</span>, I say] An emphatic resumed reference to the Reconciling Son, standing alone and “preeminent” in His wonderful work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">whether</span> they be things <span class="ital">in earth, or</span> things <span class="ital">in heaven</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">whether the things</span>,” &c. He refers back to the “<span class="ital">all things</span>” just above; see note there.—It is significant that “<span class="ital">the things under the earth</span>” are not mentioned in this great phrase. It is surely revealed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>) that all created existence, in the amplest sense, shall in some supreme way be “<span class="ital">subdued</span> unto” the Son and unto the Father in Him; there shall be <span class="ital">order</span> before the Throne in all the depths as well as heights of being. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm" title="And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.">Php 2:11</a>, and our note there. But this is another thing from “reconciliation” and “peace.” The universalism of this passage is no negation of the awful warnings of Scripture about the final and irremediable exclusion from “peace” of the impenitent creature.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What then do the words here actually import? We answer with Alford (see the whole of his careful note here): “No reconciliation [of angelic beings] must be thought of which should resemble <span class="ital">ours</span> in its process—for Christ … paid no propitiatory penalty [for angels] in the root of their nature, as including it in Himself. But, forasmuch as He is their Head as well as ours … it cannot be but that the great event in which He was glorified through suffering should also bring them nearer to God … That such increase [of blessedness] might be described as a <span class="ital">reconciliation</span> is manifest: we know from <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm" title="Behold, he puts no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight.">Job 15:15</a>, that ‘the heavens are not clean in His sight,’ and ib. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-18.htm" title=" The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.">Colossians 4:18</a>, ‘His angels He charged with folly.’ In fact every such nearer approach to Him may without violence to words be so described, in comparison with that previous greater distance which now seems like alienation; and in this case even more properly, as one of the consequences of that great propitiation whose first … effect was to reconcile to God, in the literal sense, the things upon earth, polluted and hostile in consequence of man’s sin. So that our interpretation may be thus summed up: all creation subsists in Christ: all creation therefore is affected by His act of propitiation: sinful creation is, in the strictest sense, <span class="ital">reconciled</span>, from being at enmity: sinless creation, ever at a distance from His unapproachable purity, is lifted into nearer participation … of Him, and is thus <span class="ital">reconciled</span>, though not in the strictest, yet in a very intelligible and allowable sense.”—The implied need, even in <span class="ital">the angelic</span> world, of the Son’s Work of peace, would have a special point for the Colossians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe, in leaving <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>, the order of the words in the Greek: <span class="bld">And through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, making peace through the blood of His cross—through Him, whether the things</span>, &c.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/colossians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀποκαταλλάξαι</span>, <span class="ital">to reconcile</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm" title="And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:">Ephesians 2:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>, <span class="ital">all things</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸν</span>, <span class="ital">unto Himself</span>) <span class="ital">i.e. unto God</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm" title="To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰρηνοποιήσας</span>, <span class="ital">having made peace</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-17.htm" title="And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.">Ephesians 2:17</a>.

Having concluded peace; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a>. The participle is parallel with to reconcile, and marks peace-making and reconciliation as contemporaneous.

The connection is: it was the good pleasure of the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm">Colossians 1:19</a>) to reconcile. The compounded preposition &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769; gives the force of back, hinting at restoration to a primal unity. So, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-16</a>, it occurs as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>, in connection with &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; alienated, as if they had not always been strangers.
