There is nothing corresponding to “the Father” in the original. Our rendering involves the supply of the nominative <span class= "ital">God, i.e., </span>“the Father,” or <span class= "ital">Christ</span> to the verb, so that the sentence may run, <span class= "ital">the Father</span> or <span class= "ital">Christ determined of His good pleasure that, </span>&c. The supply of the nominative “Christ” is easier grammatically; but it accords ill with the invariable reference of all things, both by our Lord Himself and His Apostles, ultimately to the good pleasure of the Father. Moreover, the verb is so constantly used of God that the supply of the nominative “God,” though unexampled, is far from inadmissible. The simplest grammatical construction would, indeed, be to take “the fulness” as the nominative, and render for <span class= "ital">in Him all the fulness </span>(<span class= "ital">of God</span>)<span class= "ital"> was pleased to dwell.</span> But the personification of “the fulness,” common in Gnostic speculation, is hardly after the manner of St. Paul. Perhaps, on the whole, the rendering of our version (which is usually adopted) is to be preferred; especially as it suits better with the following verse. (2) The sense is, however, quite clear, and is enforced by <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>, “In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” On the word “fulness” (<span class= "ital">pleroma</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>. The “fulness of the Godhead” is the essential nature, comprising all the attributes, of Godhead. The indwelling of such Deity in the humanity of Christ is the ground of all His exaltation as the “Head,” “the beginning,” the “firstborn from the dead,” and the triumphant King, on which St. Paul had already dwelt. By it alone can He be the true Mediator between God and man.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 Christ in his human nature, is the visible discovery of the invisible God, and he that hath seen Him hath seen the Father. Let us adore these mysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For it pleased the Father - The words "the Father" are not in the original, but they are not improperly supplied. Some word must be understood, and as the apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12</a> referred to "the Father" as having a claim to the thanks of his people for what he had done, and as the great favor for which they ought to be thankful is that which he immediately specifies - the exaltation of Christ, it is not improper to suppose that this is the word to be understood here. The meaning is, that he chose to confer on his Son such a rank, that in all things he might have the pre-eminence, and that there might be in him "all fulness." Hence, by his appointment, he was the agent in creation, and hence he is placed over all things as the head of the church.<p>That in him should all fulness dwell - That in him there should be such dignity, authority, power, and moral excellence as to be fitted to the work of creating the world, redeeming his people, and supplying everything needful for their salvation. On the word "fullness," see <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, note, 16, note; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm">Romans 11:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm">Ephesians 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>. This is to us a most precious truth. We have a Saviour who is in no respect deficient in wisdom, power, and grace to redeem and save us. There is nothing necessary to be done in our salvation which he is not qualified to do; there is nothing which we need to enable us to perform our duties, to meet temptation, and to bear trial, which he is not able to impart. In no situation of trouble and danger will the church find that there is a deficiency in him; in no enterprise to which she can put her hands will there be a lack of power in her great Head to enable her to accomplish what he calls her to. We may go to him in all our troubles, weaknesses temptations, and needs, and may be supplied from his fullness - just as, if we were thirsty, we might go to an ocean of pure water and drink. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Greek, "(God) was well pleased," &c.<p>in him&#8212;that is, in the Son (Mt 3:17).<p>all fulness&#8212;rather as Greek, "all the fulness," namely, of God, whatever divine excellence is in God the Father (Col 2:9; Eph 3:19; compare Joh 1:16; 3:34). The Gnostics used the term "fulness," for the assemblage of emanations, or angelic powers, coming from God. The Spirit presciently by Paul warns the Church, that the true "fulness" dwells in Christ alone. This assigns the reason why Christ takes precedence of every creature (Col 1:15). For two reasons Christ is Lord of the Church: (1) Because the fulness of the divine attributes (Col 1:19) dwells in Him, and so He has the power to govern the universe; (2) Because (Col 1:20) what He has done for the Church gives Him the right to preside over it.<p>should &#8230; dwell&#8212;as in a temple (Joh 2:21). This indwelling of the Godhead in Christ is the foundation of the reconciliation by Him [Bengel]. Hence the "and" (Col 1:20) connects as cause and effect the two things, the Godhead in Christ, and the reconciliation by Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A learned man reads it: For all fulness pleased to dwell in him.

The phrase, "the Father", is not in the original text, but is rightly supplied; since he is expressly mentioned in the context, as he who makes the saints meet to be partakers of the heavenly glory; who deliver, them from the power and dominion of sin, and translates them into the kingdom of his dear Son; and who, by Christ, reconciles all things to himself, <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm">Colossians 1:12</a>, and whose sovereign will and pleasure it is, <p>that in him should all fulness dwell: by which is meant, not the fulness of the deity, though it is read by some the fulness of the Godhead: which seems to be transcribed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>; but though all the perfections of God are in Christ, as eternity, omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, immutability, independence, and necessary existence, and every other, or he would not be equal with God; nor could all the fulness of the Godhead be said to dwell in him, should anyone be wanting; yet this is a fulness possessed by him, that does not spring from, nor depend upon the Father's good will and pleasure; but what he naturally and necessarily enjoys by a participation of the same undivided nature and essence with the Father and Spirit: nor is the relative fulness of Christ intended, which is his church, so called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>; and will be so when all the elect are gathered in, and filled with all the gifts and graces of his Spirit, and are arrived to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; for though every believer dwells in Christ, and Christ in him, yet the church is not said to dwell in Christ, but Christ in the church; moreover, as yet she is not his fulness, at least in the sense she will be, and much less can she be said to be all fulness: nor is this to be understood of Christ's fulness of fitness and abilities, as God-man and Mediator, to perform his work and office as such; though this may be taken into the sense of the text as a part, yet is not the whole; but rather chiefly that dispensatory communicative fulness, which is, of the Father's good will and pleasure, put into the hands of Christ to be distributed to others, is here designed. There is a fulness of nature in Christ; the light of nature is from him, and communicated by him to mankind; the blessings of nature are the blessings of his left hand, which he distributes to his people as he thinks fit; and all things in nature are subservient to his mediatorial kingdom and glory. There is a fulness of grace in him, out of which saints receive, and grace for grace, or a large abundance of it; the fulness of the spirit of grace, and of all the graces and gifts of the Spirit is in him; and of all the blessings of grace, as a justifying righteousness, pardon of sin, adoption, sanctification, even of all that grace that is implanted in regeneration, that is necessary to carry on and finish the good work upon the soul; there is a fulness of all light and life, of wisdom, and strength, of peace, joy, and comfort, and of all the promises of grace, both with respect to this world and that which is to come; and there is also a fulness of glory in him, not only the grace, but the glory of the saints, is laid up and hid with him, and is safe and secure in him: this is said to dwell in Christ, which implies its being in him; it is not barely in intention, design, and purpose, but it is really and actually in him, nor is it in any other; and hence it comes to be communicated to the saints: and it also denotes the continuance of it with him; it is an abiding fulness, and yields a continual daily supply to the saints, and will endure to the end of time, and be as sufficient for the last as the first believer; it is like the subject of it, the same yesterday, today, and for ever: and it also intends the safety of it: the saints' life both of grace and glory is hid with Christ, and is secure, it is out of the reach of men and devils, and can never be lost, or they deprived of it; and all this is owing not to any merits of men, to their faith and holiness, or good works, which are all the fruits of this fulness, but to the good will of God; "it pleased the Father" to place it here for them; it was owing to his good will to his Son, and therefore he puts all things into his hands; and to his elect in him, for, having loved them with an everlasting love, he takes everlasting care of them, and makes everlasting provision for them; it was his pleasure from all eternity to take such a step as this, well knowing it was not proper to put it into the hands of Adam, nor into the hands of angels, nor into their own at once; he saw none so fit for it as his Son, and therefore it pleased him to commit it unto him; and it is his good will and sovereign pleasure, that all grace should come through Christ, all communion with him here, and all enjoyment of him hereafter; which greatly enhances and sets forth the glory of Christ as Mediator, one considerable branch of which is, that he is full of grace and truth; this qualifies him to be the head of the church, and gives a reason, as these words be, why he has, and ought to have, the preeminence in all things. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For it pleased <i>the Father</i> that in him should <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> all fulness dwell;</span><p>(m) Most plentiful abundance of all things pertaining to God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>.[43] <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ</span></span></span>] Confirmatory of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἽΝΑ ΓΈΝΗΤΑΙ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, just said: “about which divinely intended <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΊΓΝΕΣΘΑΙ ἘΝ ΠᾶΣΙΝ ΑὐΤῸΝ ΠΡΩΤΕΎΟΝΤΑ</span></span></span> <span class="ital">there can be no doubt, for it has pleased</span>, that <span class="ital">in Him</span>, etc.” How could He, who was thus destined to be possessor of the divine fulness and reconciler of the world, have been destined otherwise than to become <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν πρωτεύων</span>!

Inasmuch as the charismatic <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΉΡΩΜΑ</span></span></span> of <span class="ital">God</span>, meant in our passage, dwelt in <span class="ital">Christ</span>, and consequently Christ was the possessor and disposer of it, this divine fulness is not in substance different from the <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα Χριστοῦ</span>, out of which grace passed over to men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.">John 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm" title="Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:">Ephesians 4:13</a>). The thought and expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1 Corinthians 15:28</a> are different from our passage, and different also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm" title="Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.">Ephesians 1:23</a>.

Observe, at the same time, the stress lying on the <span class="greekheb">πᾶν</span>, in contrast to a merely <span class="ital">partial</span> imparting out of this fulness, which would have been inadequate to the object of reconciling the universe. The <span class="ital">ontological</span> interpretation of the “fulness of the <span class="ital">nature</span> of God” (Huther, Dalmer, Weiss; Oecumenius, and Theodoret: the nature of the <span class="greekheb">Θεὸς λόγος</span>; Calovius and others: of the <span class="ital">communicatio hypostatica</span>, that is, of the absolute immanence of God in Him, comp. Ernesti, <span class="ital">Urspr. d. Sünde</span>, I. p. 222; Rich. Schmidt, <span class="ital">Paul.

The divine <span class="ital">nature</span> is <span class="ital">presupposed</span> in what is here said of Christ. Comp. Gess, <span class="ital">v. d. Pers. Christi</span>, p. 85. Some (see especially Steiger, Bähr, and Reuss) have regarded <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρωμα</span> as derived <span class="ital">from the Gnostic terminology of the false teachers</span>, who might perhaps, like Valentinus, have given this name to the aggregate of the Aeons (see Baur, <span class="ital">Gnosis</span>, p. 157),[46] and in opposition to whom Paul maintains that in Jesus there dwells the <span class="ital">totality</span> of all divine powers of life, and not merely a single emanated spirit; but this view is all the more unwarranted, because Paul himself does not intimate any such polemical destination of the word; on the contrary, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a> also he uses <span class="greekheb">πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> evidently without any reference of the kind. And if he had wished to place the whole fulness of the efflux of divine power in contrast to an asserted single emanation, he must have prefixed, not <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> (<span class="ital">in Him and in none other</span>), but <span class="greekheb">πᾶν</span> (<span class="ital">the whole</span> <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span>, <span class="ital">not merely a single constituent element</span> of it) with the main emphasis, and have logically said: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα εὐδόκησεν ἐν αὐτῷ κατοικῆσαι</span>. Hofmann (comp. his <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. p. 29, 359), who in general has quite misunderstood <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a> f. (comp. above on <span class="greekheb">εὐδόκησεν</span>), takes <span class="greekheb">πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα</span> as “the <span class="ital">one-like totality of that which is;</span>” and holds that the will of Christ (to which <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκ</span>. applies) can only have been, “<span class="ital">that that may come to dwell in Him, which otherwise would not be in Him, consequently not what is in God, but what is out of God.</span>” This idea of the immanent indwelling of the universe in Christ, repeated by Schenkel in the sense of Christ being the <span class="ital">archetype</span>, would be entirely alien to the N. T. view of the relation of Christ to the world, and is not indicated either at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a> or here in the context by <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα ἐν αὐτῷ συνέστηκεν</span>. Christ is not the place <span class="ital">for the world</span>, so that ultimately all comes to dwell in Him, as all has been created in Him and has in Him its subsistence; but the world originated and maintained through Him, which He was to redeem, is the place <span class="ital">for Him</span>.[47] If Paul had really entertained the obscure paradoxical conception attributed to him by Hofmann, he would have known how to express it simply by <span class="greekheb">τὸ πᾶν</span> (or <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>) <span class="greekheb">κατοικῆσαι</span>, or by <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ παντὸς</span> (or <span class="greekheb">τῶν πάντων</span>) <span class="greekheb">κατοικῆσ</span>.

Analogous is the conception of the dwelling of Christ (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>) or of the Spirit (see Theile on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-5.htm" title="Do you think that the scripture said in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?">Jam 4:5</a>) in believers.

In point of <span class="ital">time</span>, the indwelling of the divine fulness of grace according to God’s pleasure in Christ refers to the <span class="ital">earthly life of the Incarnate One</span>, who was destined by God to fulfil the divine work of the <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλάξαι τὰ πάντα</span>, and was to be empowered thereto by the dwelling in Him of that whole divine <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span>. Without having completed the performance of this work, He could not become <span class="greekheb">ἐν πᾶσιν πρωτεύων</span>; but of this there could be no doubt, for God has caused it to be completed through Him (<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>). Ernesti, Urspr. d. Sünde, I. p. 215 f. (comp. also Weiss, Bibl. Theol. p. 428, ed. 2), refers <span class="greekheb">εὐδόκησε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. to the <span class="ital">heavenly</span> state of Christ, in which God, by way of reward for the completion of His work, has made Him the organ of His glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Php 2:9</a>); he also is of opinion that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΑΤΑΛΛΆΞΑΙ</span></span></span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a> does not apply to the reconciliation through His blood, but to the reunion of all created things through the exalted Lord, as a similar view is indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm" title="That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;">Php 2:10</a>. But this idea of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΑΤΑΛΛΆΞΑΙ</span></span></span> is just the point on which this view breaks down. For <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm" title=" And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled">Colossians 1:21</a> clearly shows that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΚΑΤΑΛΛΆΞΑΙ</span></span></span> is to be taken in the usual sense of the work of reconciliation completed through the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἹΛΑΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span> of Christ. Moreover, that which Christ received through His exaltation was not the divine <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΉΡΩΜΑ</span></span></span>, but the divine <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΞΑ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[43] Holtzmann, after having rejected vv. 14–18 entirely as an interpolation, allows to stand as original in vv. 19, 20 only the words: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ εὐδόκησεν καταλλάξαι</span>, to which <span class="greekheb">καταλλ</span>. there is then attached in ver. 21, as object, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμᾶς</span>, also you, with reference to <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> in ver. 13. How daring and violent, and yet how paltry (rescuing merely the <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὑμᾶς</span>), would the procedure of the author thus have been!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[44] Hence not: <span class="ital">“la totalité de l’être</span> qui doit être realisée dans le monde,” Sabatier, <span class="ital">l’apôtre Paul,</span> p. 209.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[45] As in the <span class="ital">Son</span> of God in the metaphysical sense; hence the original being of God in Him cannot be conceived merely as <span class="ital">ideal,</span> which was to develope itself into reality, and the realization of which, when it at length became perfect, made Him the absolute abode of the fulness of Godhead. So Beyschlag, <span class="ital">Christol.</span> p. 232 f., according to whom Christ would be conceived as <span class="ital">“man drawing down upon himself”</span> this indwelling of God. He is conceived as the incarnate <span class="ital">Son</span> (comp. ver. 13 ff.), who, in accordance with the Father’s decree, has appeared as bearer ot the whole fulness of salvation. For He was its dwelling not merely <span class="ital">in principle,</span> but in <span class="ital">fact</span> and <span class="ital">reality,</span> when He appeared, and He employed it for the work, which the Father desired to accomplish by Him (ver. 20). Comp. <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>. This verse with <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a> shows how the Son was able to hold the position assigned to Him in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>. Further, this verse leads up to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>. The thought is then: All the fulness dwelt in the Son, therefore reconciliation could be accomplished through the blood of His cross, and so He became the Head of the body.—<span class="greekheb">εὐδόκησεν</span>. Three views are taken as to the subject of the verb. (1) Meyer, Alford, Lightfoot, Oltramare, Haupt and the great majority of commentators supply <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span> as the subject. (2) Ewald, Ellicott, Weiss, Soden and Abbott make <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> the subject. (3) Conybeare, Hofmann and Findlay supply <span class="greekheb">ὁ υἱός</span> or <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span>. In favour of (3) the unique emphasis on the sovereignty of Christ in this passage is urged, also that it prepares the way for the reference of <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαταλλάξαι</span> and <span class="greekheb">εἰρηνοποιήσας</span> to Christ, in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;...">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-27.htm" title="That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.">Ephesians 5:27</a>. It is also true that the subject from <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a> is, for the most part, the Son. But the usage of Paul leads us to think of the Father, not of the Son, as the One who forms the eternal purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm" title="Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:">Ephesians 1:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm" title="To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses to them; and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>). Nor does <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a> run on naturally. If the Son is the subject of “was well pleased,” the obvious interpretation of <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ ἀποκ</span>. is to reconcile through the fulness, which is highly improbable. We should accordingly have to give to <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span> a reflexive sense, and translate “through Himself,” which is grammatically possible, but not natural. There is the further objection which it shares with (1) that a change of subjects to the infinitives is required, <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> being the subject of <span class="greekheb">κατοικ</span>., while that to <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατ</span>. is <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span> or <span class="greekheb">υἱός</span>. But it is less awkward in (1) than in (3), for the former does not make the Son at once the originator and the Agent of the plan of reconciliation. Against (1), besides the objection just mentioned, it may be said that the construction with <span class="greekheb">εὐδόκ</span>. is unusual, for its subject is elsewhere in the N.T. the subject of the following infinitive (this tells against (3) also), and that in a passage of such importance the subject could not have been omitted. But for the omission of the subject Lightfoot compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.">Jam 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-6.htm" title="But he gives more grace. Why he said, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.">Jam 4:6</a>. What, however, is really decisive in its favour is the difficulty of accepting (2). The expression “all the fulness was well pleased” is very strange in itself. But what is much stranger is that the fulness was not only pleased to dwell in Him, but through Him to reconcile all things unto Him. And the only natural course is to refer <span class="greekheb">εἰρνηνοπ</span>. to the subject of <span class="greekheb">εὐδόκ</span>., but the masculine makes it difficult to regard <span class="greekheb">πλήρ</span>. as that subject. We should therefore translate “God” [or “the Father”] “was well pleased”.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα</span>. On <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> the detached note in Lightfoot, pp. 255–271, should be consulted, with the criticism of it in an article on “The Church as the Fulfilment of the Christ,” by Prof. J. Armitage Robinson (<span class="ital">Expositor</span>, April, 1898), also Oltramare’s note. Lightfoot urges in opposition to Fritzsche that <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> has always a genuinely passive sense, not the pseudo-passive sense “id quo res impletur” which Fritzsche gave it, and which is really the active “id quod implet,” but that which is completed. The basis of the decision is that substantives in -<span class="greekheb">μα</span>, since they are derived from the perfect passive, must have a passive sense. But, as Prof. Robinson points out, these substantives have their stem not in -<span class="greekheb">μα</span> but in -<span class="greekheb">ματ</span>, and therefore are not to be connected with the perfect passive. He reaches the conclusion that if a general signification is to be sought for, we may say that these nouns represent “the <span class="ital">result</span> of the agency of the corresponding verb”. If the verb is intransitive the substantive will be so; if it is transitive and the substantive corresponds to its object the noun is passive, but if the substantive is followed by the object of the verb in the genitive it is active. According to the double use of <span class="greekheb">πληροῦν</span> to “fill” and to “fulfil,” <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> may mean that which fills or that which fulfils, the fulness, fulfilment or complement. Oltramare comes to the conclusion that the word means perfection, and interprets this passage to mean that ideal perfection dwelt in Christ. Accordingly he escapes the question what genitive should be supplied after it. It does not seem, however, that the word meant moral perfection. Many think that <span class="greekheb">θεότητος</span> should be supplied after <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span>, as is actually done in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>. Serious difficulties beset this view. If we think of the eternal indwelling, we make it dependent on the Father’s will, an Arian view, which Paul surely did not hold. Alford’s reply to this (endorsed by Abbott) that all that is the Son’s right “is His Father’s pleasure, and is ever referred to that pleasure by Himself,” is anything but cogent, for <span class="greekheb">εὐδόκησεν</span> refers to a definite decree of the Father, and the obvious meaning of the words is that it lay within the Father’s choice whether the <span class="greekheb">πλήρωμα</span> should dwell in the Son or not. It might refer to the exaltation of Christ, in which the Son resumed that of which He had emptied Himself in the Incarnation. This would follow the reference to the resurrection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>. But the order does not indicate the true logical or chronological sequence. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;...">Colossians 1:19-20</a> give the ground (<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>) on which the Son’s universal pre-eminence rests, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a> is quite incompatible with this reference to the exalted state, co-ordinated as <span class="greekheb">κατοικ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἀποκατ</span>. are by <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>. But neither does it suit the incarnate state, which was a state of self-emptying and beggary; even if we could attach any very definite meaning to the words that in the Incarnate Son the Father was pleased that all the fulness of the Godhead should dwell. We should, therefore, probably reject the view that <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλήρωμα</span> means the fulness of the Godhead. Since the co-ordinate clause speaks of reconciliation through the blood of the cross, it seems probable that we should regard <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a> as asserting such an indwelling as made this possible. We should therefore with Meyer explain <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλ</span>. as the fulness of grace, “the whole <span class="ital">charismatic riches of God</span>” (so also De W., Eadie, Alf., Findl.). Haupt thinks that the full content of the Divine nature is referred to, but with special reference to the Divine grace, and so far he agrees with Meyer. We should also, with Meyer, interpret the indwelling as having reference to the sending of the Son in the incarnation. The Father was pleased that He should come “with the <span class="ital">whole treasure of Divine grace</span>”. Thus equipped His death procured reconciliation. Gess takes it similarly, though he thinks, on the whole, that a gradual process is referred to. Findlay’s modification of this in favour of a reference to the Ascension (for which he compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,...">Ephesians 1:20-23</a>) must be rejected on the grounds mentioned above. The decree of the Father may be supra-temporal, as Haupt thinks, the aorist being used as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>, though it is more obvious to take it as referring to the time when He was sent. Two other interpretations of <span class="greekheb">τὸ πλ</span>. may be mentioned. Theodoret and other Fathers, followed by some moderns, have explained it to mean the Church. But the indwelling of the <span class="greekheb">πλ</span>. prepares the way for the reconciliation, in consequence of which the Church first becomes possible. Nor could <span class="greekheb">πλ</span>. by itself mean this; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a> the reference is supplied by the context. More possible is the view that it means the universe = <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a> (Hofm., Cremer, Godet, who compares “the earth is the Lord’s and the fulness of it”). In that case the genitive supplied would be <span class="greekheb">τῶν πάντων</span> from <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>. But if the reference in this be to the summing up of all things in Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm" title="That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:">Ephesians 1:10</a>), it is excluded by the fact that the indwelling of the fulness is contemporaneous with the incarnate state. A more plausible interpretation would be to regard <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> as dwelling in Christ before His death, and by sharing that death, attaining reconciliation with God. This would be an extension of the Pauline thought that all men died when Christ died (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm" title="For the love of Christ constrains us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>). But it would be an extension precisely corresponding to that of the scope of redemption in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm" title=" And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.">Colossians 1:20</a>, for which, indeed, it would admirably prepare the way, the universe dwelling in the Son that His death might be universal in its effects. That the Son is not only Head of the race, but Head also of the universe, is a familiar thought in these Epistles, and as His acts are valid for the one so also for the other. Nothing more is implied for the relation of the universe to Christ than of the race, and if the main stress be thrown on angels and men, there is nothing incongruous in the idea. Whether Paul would have used it in this sense without fuller explanation is uncertain; but in any case a genitive has to be supplied. A further question must be briefly referred to, that of the origin of the term. Several scholars think it was already in use as a technical term of the false teachers at the time when the letter was written. This is possible, and in its favour is its absolute use here; but, if so, it is strange that Paul should use it with such different applications. It is more probable that its origin is due to him.—<span class="greekheb">κατοικῆσαι</span>. The word expresses permanent abode as opposed to a temporary sojourn. Bengel says aptly “Haec inhabitatio est fundamentum reconciliationis”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">For it pleased</span> the Father, &c.] “<span class="ital">The Father</span>” is supplied by the translators (A.V. and R.V., and the older versions from Tyndale (1534) downwards, except the Roman Catholic Rhemish (1582) which reads “<span class="ital">in Him it hath well pleased al fulnes to inhabite</span>.” The Old Latin reads <span class="ital">in ipso complacuit omnis plenitudo inhabitare;</span> the Vulgate, <span class="ital">in ipso complacuit omnem plenitudinem inhabitare</span>.—Grammatically, the Greek admits three possible explanations: (<span class="ital">a</span>) “<span class="ital">For in Him all the Plenitude was pleased to take up Its abode;</span>” (<span class="ital">b</span>) “<span class="ital">For He</span> (<span class="ital">the Son</span>) <span class="ital">was pleased that all the Plenitude should take up Its abode in Him</span>;” (<span class="ital">c</span>) “<span class="ital">For He</span> (<span class="ital">God, the Father</span>) <span class="ital">was pleased that all the Plenitude should take up Its abode in Him</span> (<span class="ital">the Son</span>).” What decision does the context, or other side-evidence, indicate? The explanation (<span class="ital">b</span>) is discredited as assigning to the Son a determining choice which the whole context leads us to assign to the Father. The explanation (<span class="ital">a</span>), adopted and ably defended by Ellicott, is that of the Old Latin Version. It is grammatically simple, and it is capable of doctrinal defence; “the Plenitude” of the Divine Nature being taken to include the actings of the Divine Will as the expression of the Nature, and so to <span class="ital">signify</span> the Divine Personality (here, of course, that of the Father). But it is in itself a surprising and extremely anomalous expression; and it becomes still more so when we read on, and see what are the actions attributed to the same Subject, and that the Subject appears in the masculine gender in the word rendered “<span class="ital">having made peace</span>” (see note below), while the word <span class="ital">Plerôma</span> (<span class="ital">Plenitude</span>) is neuter. On the whole we believe (<span class="ital">c</span>) to be the true explanation, with Alford, and Lightfoot, who compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.">James 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-6.htm" title="But he gives more grace. Why he said, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.">James 4:6</a> (the better supported reading in each case); “<span class="ital">the crown which He</span> (unnamed) <span class="ital">promised;</span>” “<span class="ital">the Spirit which He</span> (unnamed) <span class="ital">caused to dwell in us</span>.” He points out also that the noun (<span class="ital">eudokia</span>) kindred to the verb here is often, and almost as a habit, used of <span class="ital">God’s</span> “good pleasure” where God is not named.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all fulness</span>] Lit. and better <span class="bld">all the Fulness, all the Plenitude</span>. Cp. below <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>; “all the Fulness of <span class="ital">the Godhead;</span>” a phrase of course explanatory of this which is so nearly connected with it. Lightfoot (pp. 323–339) discusses the word with great care and clearness, and brings out the result that the true notion of it is <span class="ital">the filled condition of a thing</span>, as when a rent is mended, an idea realized, a prophecy fulfilled. He shews that the word had acquired a technical meaning in St Paul’s time, in Jewish schools of thought, a meaning connected especially with the eternally realized Ideal of Godhead; the Divine Fulness; “the totality of the Divine Powers and Attributes.”—See further our note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>, where the Church is called “the Plenitude of” the Son.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">dwell</span>] The verb denotes permanence; <span class="bld">should take up its lasting abode</span>. Does this “taking up the abode” refer to Eternity, or to Time? to the time-less communication of Godhead from the Father to the Son, or to a communication coincident with the completion of the Incarnate Son’s redeeming work? We think the latter, in view of the following context. From eternity, eternally and necessarily, the Plenitude “took up,” “takes up,” Its abode in Him as to His blessed Person. But not till His Work of death and resurrection was accomplished was He, historically, so constituted as that It “took up Its abode” in Him as Head and Treasury for us of “all grace.” This now He is, lastingly, everlastingly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/colossians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>.[1] <span class="greekheb">Εὐδόκησε</span>, <span class="ital">He was well-pleased</span>) viz. <span class="ital">God</span> [Engl. Vers. <span class="ital">the</span> <span class="ital">Father</span>].

So <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>. The subject of was well pleased, God, is omitted as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, and must be supplied; so that, literally, the passage would read, God was well pleased that in Him, etc. Rev., it was the good pleasure of the Father. Fullness, Rev, correctly, the fullness. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-12.htm">Romans 11:12</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>. The word must be taken in its passive sense - that with which a thing is filled, not that which fills. The fullness denotes the sum-total of the divine powers and attributes. In Christ dwelt all the fullness of God as deity. The relation of essential deity to creation and redemption alike, is exhibited by John in the very beginning of his gospel, with which this passage should be compared. In John the order is: 1. The essential nature of Christ; 2. Creation; 3. Redemption. Here it is: 1. Redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>); 2. Essential being of the Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>); 3. The Son as Creator (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>); 4. The Church, with Christ as its head (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>). Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>. Paul does not add of the Godhead to the fullness, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a> since the word occurs in direct connection with those which describe Christ's essential nature, and it would seem not to have occurred to the apostle that it could be understood in any other sense than as an expression of the plenitude of the divine attributes and powers.<p>Thus the phrase in Him should all the fullness dwell gathers into a grand climax the previous statements - image of God, first-born of all creation, Creator, the eternally preexistent, the Head of the Church, the victor over death, first in all things. On this summit we pause, looking, like John, from Christ in His fullness of deity to the exhibition of that divine fullness in redemption consummated in heaven (<a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20-22</a>).<p>There must also be taken into the account the selection of this word fullness with reference to the false teaching in the Colossian church, the errors which afterward were developed more distinctly in the Gnostic schools. Pleroma fullness was used by the Gnostic teachers in a technical sense, to express the sum-total of the divine powers and attributes. "From the pleroma they supposed that all those agencies issued through which God has at any time exerted His power in creation, or manifested His will through revelation. These mediatorial beings would retain more or less of its influence, according as they claimed direct parentage from it, or traced their descent through successive evolutions. But in all cases this pleroma was distributed, diluted, transformed, and darkened by foreign admixture. They were only partial and blurred images, often deceptive caricatures, of their original, broken lights of the great Central Light" (Lightfoot). Christ may have been ranked with these inferior images of the divine by the Colossian teachers. Hence the significance of the assertion that the totality of the divine dwells in Him.<p>Dwell (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Permanently. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-26.htm">Luke 11:26</a>. Compare the Septuagint usage of &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; permanent dwelling, and &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; transient sojourning. Thus <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-1.htm">Genesis 37:1</a>, "Jacob dwelt (permanently, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#837;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;) in the land where his father sojourned (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; A.V., was a stranger). Perhaps in contrast with the partial and transient connection of the pleroma with Christ asserted by the false teachers. The word is used of the indwelling of the Father, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-22.htm">Ephesians 2:22</a> (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; habitation of God); of the Son, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm">Ephesians 3:17</a>; and of the Spirit, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-5.htm">James 4:5</a>. </body></html>
