He, and He only, is; all else is created. It is impossible not to refer to the “I am” of Eternal existence, as claimed by our Lord for Himself. “Before Abraham was, I am” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm" title="John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.">John 1:15</a>).

In this clause is attributed to our Lord, not only the creative act, but also the constant sustaining power, “in which all lives and moves and has its being,” and which, even less than the creative agency, can be supposed to be a derivative and finite power, such as that of the <span class= "ital">Demiurgus</span> of Gnostic speculation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-23 Christ in his human nature, is the visible discovery of the invisible God, and he that hath seen Him hath seen the Father. Let us adore these mysteries in humble faith, and behold the glory of the Lord in Christ Jesus. He was born or begotten before all the creation, before any creature was made; which is the Scripture way of representing eternity, and by which the eternity of God is represented to us. All things being created by Him, were created for him; being made by his power, they were made according to his pleasure, and for his praise and glory. He not only created them all at first, but it is by the word of his power that they are upheld. Christ as Mediator is the Head of the body, the church; all grace and strength are from him; and the church is his body. All fulness dwells in him; a fulness of merit and righteousness, of strength and grace for us. God showed his justice in requiring full satisfaction. This mode of redeeming mankind by the death of Christ was most suitable. Here is presented to our view the method of being reconciled. And that, notwithstanding the hatred of sin on God's part, it pleased God to reconcile fallen man to himself. If convinced that we were enemies in our minds by wicked works, and that we are now reconciled to God by the sacrifice and death of Christ in our nature, we shall not attempt to explain away, nor yet think fully to comprehend these mysteries; but we shall see the glory of this plan of redemption, and rejoice in the hope set before us. If this be so, that God's love is so great to us, what shall we do now for God? Be frequent in prayer, and abound in holy duties; and live no more to yourselves, but to Christ. Christ died for us. But wherefore? That we should still live in sin? No; but that we should die to sin, and live henceforth not to ourselves, but to Him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he is before all things - As he must be, if he created all things. Those who regard this as referring to a moral creation, interpret it as meaning that he has the pre-eminence over all things; not as referring to his pre-existence. But the fair and proper meaning of the word "before" (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;  pro) is, that he was before all things in the order of existence; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-55.htm">John 11:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-36.htm">Acts 5:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-38.htm">Acts 21:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>. It is equivalent to saying that he was eternal - for he that had an existence before any thing was created, must be eternal. Thus, it is equivalent to the phrase, "In the beginning;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>.<p>And by him all things subsist - Or are sustained; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>. The meaning is, that they are kept in the present state; their existence, order, and arrangement are continued by his power. If unsupported by him, they would fall into disorder, or sink back to nothing. If this be the proper interpretation, then it is the ascription to Christ of infinite power - for nothing less could be sufficient to uphold the universe; and of infinite wisdom - for this is needed to preserve the harmonious action of the suns and systems of which it is composed. None could do this but one who is divine; and hence we see the reason why he is represented as the image of the invisible God. He is the great and glorious and everactive agent by whom the perfections of God are made known. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

There is no evidence, however, of their particular views, and the further forms assumed by the Gnostic elements, as they showed themselves according to the Fathers in <span class="ital">Simon Magus</span> (Iren. <span class="ital">Haer</span>. i. 20 “Eunoiam … generare angelos et potestates, a quibus et mundum hunc factum dixit;” comp. Epiph. <span class="ital">Haer</span>. xxi. 4), <span class="ital">Cerinthus</span>, etc., and especially among the <span class="ital">Valentinians</span>, while certainly to be recognised as fundamentally akin to the Colossian doctrinal errors (comp. Heinrici, <span class="ital">Valentinian. Gnosis</span>, 1871), are not to be identified with them; nor are those elements to be made use of as a proof of the post-apostolic origin of the epistle, as still is done by Hilgenfeld (see his <span class="ital">Zeitschr</span>. 1870, p. 246 f.), and more cautiously by Holtzmann. Of Ebionitism only <span class="ital">Essene</span> elements are to be found in Colossae, mingled with other Gnostic doctrines, which were not held by the later Ebionites. In particular, the <span class="greekheb">πρὸ πάντων εἶναι</span>, on which Paul lays so much stress, must have been doubted in Colossae, although a portion of the Ebionites expressly and emphatically taught it (<span class="greekheb">λέγουσιν ἄνωθεν μὲν ὄντα πρὸ πάντων δὲ κτισθέντα</span>, Epiph. <span class="ital">Haer</span>. XXX. 3). Moreover, the opinion that Paul derived the appellations of the classes of angels in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a> from the language of the heretics themselves (Böhmer, comp. Olshausen) is to be rejected, because in other passages also, where there is no contrast to the Gnostic doctrine of Aeons, he makes use in substance of these names (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-38.htm" title="For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,">Romans 8:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-11.htm" title="Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.">Ephesians 6:11</a> ff.). They are rather to be regarded as well-known and generally-current appellations, which were derived from the terminology of later Judaism, and which heretics made use of in common with the orthodox. The anti-Gnostic element is contained, not in the technical expressions, but in the doctrinal contents of the passage; and it was strong enough to induce Marcion, who took offence at it, to omit <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:...">Colossians 1:15-17</a> (Tertullian, <span class="ital">c.

Lightfoot (followed by Westcott and Hort and Ellicott) accents <span class="greekheb">ἔστιν</span>, “He exists,” on account of the present, and compares <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ εἰμί</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-58.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.">John 8:58</a>). But there <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ εἰμί</span> stands alone, whereas here <span class="greekheb">αὐτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐστ</span>. is completed by <span class="greekheb">πρὸ πάντων</span>. Besides, there is no object in the assertion of the existence of the Son here. The sense of <span class="greekheb">ἐστὶν</span> depends to some extent on that of <span class="greekheb">πρὸ πάντων</span>. If, as is usual, <span class="greekheb">πρὸ</span> is taken here as temporal, <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> will be the pre-incarnate Son. If, however, with Haupt, it be taken to assert superiority in rank, <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span> will be the exalted Christ, and the present will be quite regular. It is urged that for this some other preposition, such as <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ</span> or <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span>, would have been expected. Gess says that in each of the eleven other passages in which it occurs in Paul it is temporal, and in the other N.T. passages (37) it is used of place or, as generally, of time, except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">Jam 5:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-8.htm" title="And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.">1 Peter 4:8</a>, where it is used of rank. It is used, however, in classical Greek in this latter sense. Perhaps it is safest to allow the general Pauline usage to determine the sense here. In this case <span class="greekheb">πρὸ</span> is temporal and <span class="greekheb">ἐστιν</span> a timeless present. <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span> is, of course, neuter, like <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span>, not masculine.—<span class="greekheb">συνέστηκεν</span>: “hold together”. The Son is the centre of unity for the universe. He keeps all its parts in their proper place and due relations and combines them into an ordered whole. Apart from Him it would go to pieces. Philo ascribes a similar function to the Logos. Haupt thinks that this thought that Christ is the principle of coherence for the universe is not in the passage, which means no more than that He sustains it (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm" title="Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high:">Hebrews 1:3</a>, <span class="greekheb">φέρων τὰ πάντα</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:...">Colossians 1:15-17</a> given by Oltramare should not be passed over. He eliminates the idea of pre-existence from the passage, and says that the reference is throughout to Christ as Redeemer. God had in creation to provide by a plan of Redemption for the entrance of evil into the universe, and only on that condition could it take place. So since Christ is the Redeemer, creation is based upon Him, He is the means to it, and the end which it contemplates. He objects to the common view on the following grounds: (1) Elsewhere Paul speaks of God, not Christ, as the Creator and goal of the universe; (2) Paul starts from the Christ in whom we have redemption as <span class="greekheb">πρωτότ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>. <span class="greekheb">κτίσεως</span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm" title=" And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.">Colossians 1:18</a>, which refers to the same Person as <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm" title=" And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.">Colossians 1:17</a>, He is spoken of as the Head of the Church, therefore the context is against any reference to a pre-incarnate Christ; (3) He carefully avoids saying that the Son has created all things, though he has to change the subject of the sentence. In reply to (1) it may be said that the Son acts as Agent of the Father, and so creation may be referred to either, and that while Paul contemplates the final surrender by the Son of the kingdom to the Father, he also contemplates a prior subjection of everything to the Son. Oltramare himself, for another purpose, points to apparent inconsistency in John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-2.htm" title="The same was in the beginning with God.">John 1:2</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm" title="And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; These things said the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God;">Revelation 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm" title="You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.">Revelation 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-6.htm" title="And swore by him that lives for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer:">Revelation 10:6</a>) and the author of Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm" title="Has in these last days spoken to us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;">Hebrews 1:2</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm" title="For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.">Hebrews 2:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-3.htm" title="Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.">Hebrews 11:3</a>). If these writers did not find the two views incompatible, why should Paul have done so? In reply to (2) it may be urged that Paul’s hold on the personal identity of the Son in the states through which He passed was strong enough to enable Him to glide from one to the other without any sense of incongruity. As to (3), the change in the form of sentence is probably to prepare for <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς αὐτὸν</span>. There is a similar change at <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>, where <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ</span> corresponds to <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>). His own view is open to fatal objections. It is not clear that the creation of the angels who did not fall would be conditional on provision being made for Redemption, nor yet how this would prove the superiority of the Redeemer to these angels. The insuperable difficulty, however, is that the thought is so far-fetched and not naturally suggested by the words. <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ ἐκτίσθη τὰ πάντα</span> can hardly be consistent with the creation of the universe long before the Son came into existence. Nor can <span class="greekheb">διʼ αὐτοῦ</span> mean merely that the Son was an indispensable condition for the creation of the universe, it implies active agency. Nor is any adequate explanation of <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πάντα ἐν αὐτῷ συνέστηκεν</span> given. Besides, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-5.htm" title="Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:...">Php 2:5-8</a> sufficiently proves that Paul believed in the pre-existence of Christ, and that makes it less than ever justifiable to take the passage in other than its plain sense.—Gess, it may be added, explains that the firstborn is the one who opens for those who follow the path of life, and by his consecration to God must purchase for them the Divine good pleasure. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-2.htm" title="Sanctify to me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.">Exodus 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-12.htm" title="That you shall set apart to the LORD all that opens the matrix, and every firstling that comes of a beast which you have; the males shall be the LORD's.">Exodus 13:12</a> <span class="ital">sq.</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-12.htm" title="And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that opens the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;">Numbers 3:12</a> <span class="ital">sq.</span> are quoted to prove this, but neither says anything of the purchase of Divine favour for those born after. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm" title="And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:">Exodus 4:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm" title="Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.">Psalm 89:27</a> are explained to mean, accordingly, that Israel and David, not the nations and their kings, are objects of God’s good pleasure and mediators of it to the world. <span class="greekheb">πρωτότ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>. <span class="greekheb">κτ</span>. is therefore explained as the opener of the path of life and mediator of God’s love to every creature. But this is to overlook the fact that in Psalms 89. the firstborn is further defined as the highest of the kings of the earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">he</span>] Emphatic in the Greek; He, and no other who could even seem to rival or obscure His sublime eminence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is before all things</span>] <span class="ital">ante omnes</span>, Latin Versions.

Nothing is left empty of His presence, but to all things and through all, severally and collectively, He is the giver and sustainer of life.... He, the Wisdom of God, holds the universe in tune together. He it is who, binding all with each, and ordering all things by His will and pleasure, produces the perfect unity of nature and the harmonious reign of law. While He abides unmoved forever with the Father, He yet moves all things by His own appointment according to the Father's will" (Athanasius). </body></html>
