Not, indeed, in the main idea. The cross, as usual, is identified with the triumph over the powers of evil which it won. The very phrase “made a show,” is cognate to the words “put Him to open shame” applied to the Crucifixion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-6.htm" title="If they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.">Hebrews 6:6</a>). The apparent triumph of the “power of darkness” over Him was His real and glorious triumph over them. The general idea is familiar to us, telling, as in the noble old hymn <span class= "ital">Vexilla Regis</span>—<p>“How of the Cross He made a throne<p>On which He reigns, a glorious king.”<p>His forgiveness of the penitent thief was the first act of His all-saving royalty. Accordingly, taking (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="Now thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the aroma of his knowledge by us in every place.">2Corinthians 2:14-16</a>) his metaphor from a Roman triumph, St. Paul represents Him as passing in triumphal majesty up the sacred way to the eternal gates, with all the powers of evil bound as captives behind His chariot before the eyes of men and angels. It is to be noted that to this clause, so characteristic of the constant dwelling on the sole glory of Christ in this Epistle, there is nothing to correspond in the parallel passage of the Epistle to the Ephesians, which dwells simply on Christ as “our peace,” and as the head of the Church.<p>The difficulty lies in the word here translated “having spoiled.” Now this translation (as old as St. Jerome’s Vulgate), makes all simple and easy; but the original word certainly means “having stripped Himself”—as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9</a>, “having put off (<span class= "ital">stripped off from ourselves</span>) the old man.” It is a word used by St. Paul alone in the New Testament, and by him only in these two passages, the latter of which makes the sense perfectly clear. Being forced, then, to adopt this translation, we see that the words admit of two renderings. (1) First, “having stripped from Himself the principalities and powers,” that is, having stripped off that condition of the earthly life which gave them a grasp or occasion against Him. But this, though adopted by many old Greek commentators (Chrysostom among the rest), seems singularly harsh in expression and far-fetched in idea, needing too much explanation to make it in any sense clear. (2) Next, “having unclothed Himself, He made a show of principalities and powers.” On the whole this rendering, although not free from difficulty, on account of the apparent want of connection of the phrase “having stripped Himself” with the context, seems the easiest. For we note that a cognate word, strictly analogous, is used thus (without an object following) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed on, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.">2Corinthians 5:4</a>, “Not that we desire to unclothe ourselves, but to clothe ourselves over our earthly vesture.” The context shows that the meaning there is “to put off the flesh.” This is suggested still more naturally in the passage before us by the preceding phrase, “in the putting off of the body of the flesh”—a phrase there used of the flesh as evil, but found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a> of the natural body of Christ. Accordingly many Latin fathers (among others Augustine) rendered “stripping Himself of the flesh,” and there is some trace of this as a reading or a gloss in the Greek of this passage. Perhaps, however, St. Paul purposely omitted the object after the verb, in order to show that it was by “stripping Himself of all” that He conquered by becoming a show in absolute humiliation, He made the powers of evil a show in His triumph.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And having spoiled - Plundered as a victorious army does a conquered country. Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>. The terms used in this verse are all military, and the idea is, that Christ has completely subdued our enemies by his death. A complete victory was achieved by his death, so that every thing is now in subjection to him, and we have nothing to fear.<p>Principalities and powers - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, note. The "principalities and powers" here referred to, are the formidable enemies that had held man in subjection, and prevented his serving God. There can be no doubt, I think, that the apostle refers to the ranks of fallen, evil spirits which had usurped a dominion over the world, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>, note. The Saviour, by his death, wrested the dominion from them, and seized upon what they had captured as a conqueror seizes upon his prey. Satan and his legions had invaded the earth and drawn its inhabitants into captivity, and subjected them to their evil reign. Christ, by his death. subdues the invaders and recaptures those whom they had subdued.<p>He made a show of them openly - As a conqueror, returning from a victory, displays in a triumphal procession the kings and princes whom he has taken, and the spoils of victory. This was commonly done when a "triumph" was decreed for a conqueror. On such occasions it sometimes happened that a considerable number of prisoners were led along amidst the scenes of triumph see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>. Paul says that this was now done "openly" - that is, it was in the face of the whole universe - a grand victory; a glorious triumph over all the powers of hell It does not refer to any public procession or display on the earth; but to the grand victory as achieved in view of the universe, by which Christ, as a conqueror, dragged Satan and his legions at his triumphal car; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>.<p>Triumphing over them in it - Margin, or, "himself." Either "by the cross," or "by himself." Or, it may mean, as Rosenmuller suggests, that "God <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a> triumphed over these foes in him; i. e., in Christ. The sense is substantially the same, that this triumph was effected by the atonement made for sin by the Redeemer. See the word "triumph" explained in the Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>. The meaning of all this is, that since Christ has achieved for us such a victory, and has subdued all the foes of man, we should not be led captive, but should regard ourselves as freemen. We should not be made again the slaves of custom, or habit, or ritual observances, or superstitious rites, or anything whatever that has its origin in the kingdom of darkness. We are bound to assert and to use our freedom, and should not allow any hostile power in the form of philosophy or false teaching of any kind, to plunder or "spoil" us; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>. The Christian is a freeman. His great Captain has subdued all his enemies, and we should not allow them again to set up their dark empire over our souls. The argument of the apostle in these verses <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13-15</a> is derived from what Christ has done for us. He mentions four things:<p>(1) He has given us spiritual life.<p>(2) he has forgiven all our trespasses.<p>(3) he has blotted out or abolished the "ordinances" that were against us.<p>(4) he has triumphed over all our foes. From all this he infers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a> ff) that we should not be made captive or subdued by any of the rites of superstition, or any of the influences of the kingdom of darkness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. Alford, Ellicott, and others translate the Greek to accord with the translation of the same Greek, Col 3:9, "Stripping off from Himself the principalities and the powers: " God put off from Himself the angels, that is, their ministry, not employing them to be promulgators of the Gospel in the way that He had given the law by their "disposition" or ministry (Ac 7:53; Ga 3:19; Heb 2:2, 5): God manifested Himself without a veil in Jesus. "The principalities and THE powers" refers back to Col 2:10, Jesus, "the Head of all principality and power," and Col 1:16. In the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, God subjected all the principalities, &c., to Jesus, declaring them to be powerless as to His work and His people (Eph 1:21). Thus Paul's argument against those grafting on Christianity Jewish observances, along with angel-worship, is, whatever part angels may be supposed to have had under the law, now at an end, God having put the legal dispensation itself away. But the objection is, that the context seems to refer to a triumph over bad angels: in 2Co 2:14, however, Christ's triumph over those subjected to Him, is not a triumph for destruction, but for their salvation, so that good angels may be referred to (Col 1:20). But the Greek middle is susceptible of English Version, "having spoiled," or, literally [Tittmann], "having completely stripped," or "despoiled" for Himself (compare Ro 8:38; 1Co 15:24; Eph 6:2). English Version accords with Mt 12:29; Lu 11:22; Heb 2:14. Translate as the Greek, "The rules and authorities."<p>made a show of them&#8212;at His ascension (see on [2418]Eph 4:8; confirming English Version of this verse).<p>openly&#8212;Joh 7:4; 11:54, support English Version against Alford's translation, "in openness of speech."<p>in it&#8212;namely, His cross, or crucifixion: so the Greek fathers translate. Many of the Latins, "In Himself" or "in Him." Eph 2:16 favors English Version, "reconcile &#8230; by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby." If "in Him," that is, Christ, be read, still the Cross will be the place and means of God's triumph in Christ over the principalities (Eph 1:20; 2:5). Demons, like other angels, were in heaven up to Christ's ascension, and influenced earth from their heavenly abodes. As heaven was not yet opened to man before Christ (Joh 3:13), so it was not yet shut against demons (Job 1:6; 2:1). But at the ascension Satan and his demons were "judged" and "cast out" by Christ's obedience unto death (Joh 12:31; 16:11; Heb 2:14; Re 12:5-10), and the Son of man was raised to the throne of God; thus His resurrection and ascension are a public solemn triumph over the principalities and powers of death. It is striking that the heathen oracles were silenced soon after Christ's ascension.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And having spoiled; </span> some render it, seeing he hath stripped or made naked, as runners and racers used to put off their clothes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Principalities and powers; </span> hence some of the ancients read putting off his flesh (possibly by the carelessness of some scribes, writing that which signifies flesh instead of that which signifies principalities, in all the authentic copies); but besides that Christ hath not put off the human nature, only the infirmities of the flesh, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-16.htm" title="Why from now on know we no man after the flesh: yes, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now from now on know we him no more.">2 Corinthians 5:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-7.htm" title="Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears to him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;">Hebrews 5:7</a></span>, it doth not agree with what follows.

Principalities of hell, the infernal powers of darkness, the devil that had the power of death, the accuser of the brethren, who often objected their debts, with all his works and posse: these Christ has divested of their armour, wherein they trusted to have ruined men, as sin, the law, and death; he has ransomed his people from him that was stronger than they, and taken the prey out of the hands of the mighty; he has bruised the serpent's head, demolished his works, destroyed him himself, and all his powers, and defeated all their counsels and designs against his elect: some render the word  "having put off", or "unclothed": and which some of the ancient writers apply to the flesh of Christ, and understand it of his putting off the flesh by death, whereby he gave the death blow to Satan and his powers, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>, to which sense agrees the Syriac version, which renders the words, , "and by the putting off of his body, he exposed to shame principalities and powers": but it may be better interpreted of unclothing, or stripping principalities and powers of their armour, with which they were clothed; as is usually done to enemies, when they fall into the hands of their conquerors: unless rather this is to be understood of Christ's taking away the power and authority of the Jewish ecclesiastical rulers and governors, by abolishing the ceremonial law, and the ordinances of it; declaring himself to be the alone King and Lawgiver in his house, and requiring subjection to his institutions and appointments, which sense agrees with the context: <p>he made a show of them openly; when being raised from the dead, he ascended on high, and led captivity captive; he led Satan and his principalities and powers captive, who had led others, as he passed through the air, the territories of the devil, in the sight of God and the holy angels: <p>triumphing over them in it; which some understand of the cross, as if where and by what he got the victory, there he triumphed; the cross, where his enemies thought to make a show of him, expose him to public scorn and contempt, and to triumph over him, was as it were the triumphant chariot, in which he triumphed over all the powers of hell, when he had conquered them by it: but the words may be rendered "in himself", as they are by the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions; and the sense be, that as he by himself got the victory, his own arm brought salvation to him, so he alone shared the glory and honour of the triumph: or it may be rendered "in him", and the whole in this and the preceding verse be applied to God the Father, who, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; is said to raise Christ from the dead, to quicken sinners dead in sins, and to forgive all their trespasses; so he may be said to blot out the handwriting of ordinances, and to spoil principalities and powers, expose them to public view and shame, and triumph over them, "in him", in and by his Son Jesus Christ: the whole is an allusion to the victories, spoils, and triumphs, of the Roman emperors, who when they had obtained a victory, a triumph was decreed for them by the senate; in which the emperor was drawn in an open chariot, and the captives being stripped of their armour, and their hands tied behind them, were led before him and exposed to public view and disgrace; while he was shouted and huzzaed through the city of Rome, and had all the marks of honour and respect given him (b): now all that is said in the preceding verses show how complete the saints are in and by Christ; and stand in no need of the philosophy of the Gentiles, or the ceremonies of the Jews; nor have anything to fear from their enemies, sin, Satan, and the law, for sin is pardoned, the law is abolished, and Satan conquered, <p>(b) Vid.

Something such as this, which is held to amount to the meaning that God has put an end to the ignorance of the Gentile world and revealed Himself to it, Paul must necessarily have <span class="ital">said;</span> no reader could unravel it from so strange a mode of veiling the conception, the more especially seeing that there is no mention at all of the victorious <span class="ital">word</span> of Christ[113] converting the Gentiles, as Hofmann thinks, but on the contrary of what God has effected in reference to the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαὶ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span> by the <span class="ital">fact of reconciliation</span> accomplished on the cross; He has by it <span class="ital">rendered powerless</span> the powers which previously held sway among mankind; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-30.htm" title="Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.">John 12:30</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-11.htm" title="Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.">John 16:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That these <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span> are two categories of <span class="ital">evil angels</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>), corresponding to two classes of good angels similarly named (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>), is taught by the context, which has nothing to do with mediating beings intervening between God and the world (Sabatier), or even with human rulers.

Even apart from the singular expression <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδυσάμ</span>. in <span class="ital">this</span> sense, this explanation is inappropriate, because the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαί</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span> appear here as <span class="ital">hostile</span> to God, as beings over whom He has <span class="ital">triumphed;</span> secondly, because the angels who ministered at the law-giving (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>) have no share in the <span class="ital">contents</span> of the law, which, as the <span class="greekheb">νόμος Θεοῦ</span>, is holy, righteous, good, and spiritual (Romans 7), and hence no deviation from God’s plan of salvation can be attributed to the angels of the law; and, finally, because the expression <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἀρχὰς κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἐξουσίας</span> is so comprehensive that, in the absence of any more precise indication in the text, it cannot be specially limited to the powers that were active in the <span class="ital">law-giving</span>, but must denote the <span class="ital">collective</span> angelic powers—hostile, however, and therefore devilish. <span class="ital">Them</span> God has <span class="ital">disarmed, put to shame</span>, and <span class="ital">triumphed</span> over, through the abrogation of men’s legal debt-bond that took place by means of the atoning death.

The former reference is maintained by the majority of the Fathers (Theophylact: <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ σταυρῷ τοὺς δαίμονας ἡττημένους δείξας</span>), Beza, Calvin, Grotius, and many others, including Böhmer, Steiger, Olshausen, Ewald, Weiss, <span class="ital">Bibl. Theol</span>. p. 432, ed. 2; and the latter, by Erasmus, Luther, Melanchthon, Wolf, Estius, Bengel, and many others, including Flatt, Bähr, Huther, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius, Bisping, Bleek, Hofmann, Rich. Schmidt. The reference to Christ is erroneous, because Christ is not mentioned at all in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>, and God pervades as subject the entire discourse from <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm" title=" In whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:">Colossians 2:11</a> onwards. We must hold, therefore, by the reference to <span class="greekheb">τῷ σταυρῷ</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> once more places the cross significantly before our eyes, just as it stood emphatically at the close of the previous sentence. <span class="ital">At the cross</span> God celebrated His triumph, inasmuch as through the death of Christ on the cross obliterating and removing out of the way the debt-bill of the law He completed the work of redemption, by which the devil and his powers were deprived of their strength, which rested on the law and its debt-bond.

(passages which touch our present one either not at all, or at the most very indirectly).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[112] Through this erroneous definition of the subject it was possible to discover in our passage the <span class="ital">descent into hell</span> (Anselm and others).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[113] In which sense also Grotius explained it, though he takes <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδυσάμ</span>. rightly as <span class="ital">exarmatos.</span> See, in opposition to him, Calovius. Hofmann’s explanation is also followed by Holtzmann, p. 222; it is an unfortunate attempt at rationalizing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[114] Hence Hofmann joins it with <span class="greekheb">θριαμβεύσας</span>, in which, however, the idea of publicity is obviously already contained. Hofmann, indeed, assumes a reference of contrast to the <span class="ital">invisible</span> triumphs, which God has ever been celebrating over those powers. But thus the idea of <span class="greekheb">θριαμβεύειν</span> is extended to an unwarranted amplitude of <span class="ital">metaphorical</span> meaning, while, nevertheless, the entire anthropopathic imagery of the passage requires the <span class="ital">strict</span> conception of the public <span class="greekheb">θρίαμβος</span> Moreover, the pretended contrast is altogether foreign to the context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[115] It is an inconsiderate fancy of Hofmann to say, by way of controverting our explanation: Who would be surprised, that the triumpher should make a show of the conquered, <span class="ital">“without previously asking their permission”?</span> As if such a thought, no doubt very silly for the victor, were necessarily the contrast to the frank daring action, with which a general, crowned with victory, is in a position to exhibit his captives without any scruple, without sparing or hesitation! He has the <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσία</span> for the <span class="greekheb">δειγματίζειν</span>, and uses it <span class="greekheb">ἐν παῤῥησίᾳ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>. In this difficult verse the meaning of almost every word is disputed. It is therefore imperative to control the exegesis by strict regard to the context. The main question relates to the character of the principalities and powers. Subordinate questions are raised as to the subject of the sentence and the meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδ</span>. The context before and after (<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a>) requires us to bring the interpretation into close connexion with the main thought, the abolition of the Law.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδυσάμενος τὰς ἀρχὰς καὶ τὰς ἐξουσίας</span>. Till recently the principalities and powers have been explained as hostile demoniacal spirits, and this view is held by Meyer, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Oltramare and Weiss. In its favour is the impression made by the verse that a victory over the powers is spoken of. How far this is so can be determined only by an examination of the terms employed. Against this view the following objections seem decisive. <span class="greekheb">ἀρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>. occur several times in the Epistle, but nowhere in this sense. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a> the reference to evil spirits is definitely and repeatedly fixed by the context. This is not so here. Further, the connexion with the context is difficult to trace. Bengel says: “Qui angelos bonos colebant, iidem malos timebant: neutrum jure”. Weiss expresses a somewhat similar idea: “It seems that the Colossian theosophists threatened the readers that they would again fall under the power of evil spirits if they did not submit to their discipline”. But not only have we no evidence for this, but this interpretation cuts the nerve of the passage, which is the abolition of the Law by the cross. Meyer’s view is more relevant: the Law is done away in Christ, and since it is the strength of sin, sin’s power is thus broken, and so is the devil’s power, which is exercised only through sin. Gess interprets that the Law through its curse created separation between men and God, and thus gave a point of support for the dominion of evil spirits. “Of this handwriting have they boasted. Our guilt was their strength. He who sees the handwriting nailed to the cross can mock these foes.” But these views are read into the passage, and do not lead up to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a>. And where the Jewish Law was absent, as in the heathen world, sin was rampant. Ellicott and Lightfoot do not attempt to trace a connexion with the context, nor on their view of <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδ</span>. is one possible. All this strongly suggests that we should give another sense to <span class="greekheb">ἀρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>. And this is secured if we identify them with <span class="greekheb">ἀρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>. already mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>). In favour of this are the following considerations: (1) Unless we are warned to the contrary it is natural to keep the same meaning throughout. (2) We thus get a thought that perfectly suits the context. This law that has been abolished was given by angels, its abolition implies their degradation. To them was also subject the whole of the observances of eating, drinking, etc. (3) It is a powerful polemic against the worship of angels (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>), which is lost on the other view. In effect Paul says, “You are worshipping angels who were degraded when Christ was crucified”. We may therefore take <span class="greekheb">ἀρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>, as in the rest of the Epistle, as angelic powers, identical with <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κόσμου</span>, and holding a special relation to the Law. The next question is as to the meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδ</span>. The translation “having put off His body” may be safely set aside, for Paul must have said this if he had meant it. The Greek commentators, followed by Ellicott and Lightfoot, interpret “having put off from Himself”. The word is used in this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9</a>. They explain that Christ divested Himself of the powers of evil that gathered about Him, since He assumed our humanity with all its temptations. But (apart from the change of subject) the change of metaphor is very awkward from stripping off adversaries, like clothes, to exhibiting and triumphing over them. More cogent is the objection caused by the strangeness of the idea. Christ wore our human nature with its liability to temptation. But that He wore evil spirits is a different and indeed most objectionable idea. The same translation is adopted by some who take the other view of <span class="greekheb">ἀρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>., and the explanation given is that God in the death of Christ divested Himself of angelic mediators. This is free from the impropriety of the other view, but shares its incongruity of metaphor. The more usual translation is “spoiled”. The middle can mean “stripped for Himself,” and this again suits either view of <span class="greekheb">ἀρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>. If evil spirits, they are stripped of their dominion; but if angels of the Law, they are despoiled of the dominion they exercise. This view, though stigmatised by Zahn as “an inexcusable caprice,” is probably best. They are fallen potentates. There is no need to worship them, or to fear their vengeance, if their commands are disobeyed. With the true interpretation of this passage, every reason disappears for assuming that Christ is the subject.—<span class="greekheb">ἐδειγμάτισεν ἐν παρρησία</span>. “He made a show of them openly.” No exhibition in disgrace is necessarily implied. The principalities and powers are exhibited in their true position of inferiority, as mediators of an abolished Law and rulers of elements to which Christians have died. <span class="greekheb">ἐν παρ</span>. is not to be translated “boldly,” for courage is not needed to exhibit those who are spoiled. The word is contrasted with “reserve,” and indicates the frank, open exhibition of the angels in their true position when the bond was cancelled and Christ was manifested as the final revelation of God.—<span class="greekheb">θριαμβεύσας</span>. This seems to express most definitely that the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>. are hostile powers. Alford, referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="Now thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the aroma of his knowledge by us in every place.">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>, says the true victory is our defeat by Him. Findlay thinks the reference in the verb (which is not earlier than Paul) is not to the Roman military triumph, but to the festal procession (<span class="greekheb">θρίαμβος</span>) of the worshippers of Dionysus. In this case God is represented as leading the angels in procession in His honour; in other words, bringing them to acknowledge His greatness and the revelation of Himself in Christ. It is perhaps safest to translate “triumphing over”. This is favoured by other passages in Paul, which imply that the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>. needed an experience of this kind.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> may refer to <span class="greekheb">Χριστ</span>. or <span class="greekheb">σταυρ</span>. or <span class="greekheb">χειρόγ</span>. The second is best, for there has been no reference to Christ since <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>, and it is the cancelling of the bond, not the bond itself, that is the cause of the triumph. It is in the death of Christ that this triumph takes place. Zahn explains the passage to mean that God has stripped away the principalities and powers which concealed Him, not from the Jews, to whom He had revealed Himself, but from the heathen world. Thus He has revealed Himself and these apparent deities in their true character. He has triumphed over them in Christ, and led them vanquished in His train. But this was not accomplished on the cross, but through the preaching of the Gospel among the Gentiles, accompanied with such signs and wonders as in the story of the maid with the spirit of divination and the exorcists at Ephesus. But this is not what is required by the argument, which has the Jewish Law in view.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">having spoiled</span>] “<span class="ital">Having put off from Himself</span>” (R.V.).—The Greek verb is apparently unknown before St Paul; classical illustration is impossible. Its literal meaning is “<span class="ital">to strip off</span>”; and its voice is middle. This voice, it is alleged, compels us to explain it of the Lord’s stripping off something <span class="ital">from Himself, divesting Himself</span>. And explanations vary between (<span class="ital">a</span>) that given in margin R.V., (“having put off from Himself <span class="ital">His body</span>”), supported by the Peshito Syriac version and (among other Fathers) by Ambrose, Hilary, and Augustine (see Lightfoot); and (<span class="ital">b</span>) that given in text R.V., advocated by Lightfoot, and supported by Chrysostom, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and other Fathers. In this last, the thought would be that the powers of evil swarmed, so to speak, around Him who had taken our place under “the curse of the Law,” and that He in His triumph, stripped or cast them off.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The objection to (<span class="ital">a</span>) is that it brings in an alien and isolated idea, and in obscure terms. The objection to (<span class="ital">b</span>) seems to us to be that it presents to us an image very peculiar in itself, and not obviously proper to the next words. <span class="ital">To cast off</span> enemies and then at once <span class="ital">to exhibit</span> them are not quite congruous ideas.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And why should we reject the A.V. rendering as if ungrammatical? The lawful force of the middle voice would be as well represented by “stripping <span class="ital">for Himself</span>” as “stripping <span class="ital">from Himself</span>”; it makes the subject of the verb to be also in some degree the object of the action. And the Lord did “strip His foes <span class="ital">for Himself</span>”<span class="ital">:</span> “He <span class="ital">taketh from him</span> the armour, and <span class="ital">divideth the spoils</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-22.htm" title="But when a stronger than he shall come on him, and overcome him, he takes from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and divides his spoils.">Luke 11:22</a>). The imagery is then congruous; the disarmed and despoiled foes are then appropriately, as captives, “<span class="ital">shewn” in triumph</span>. We recommend accordingly the A.V.[83]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[83] It is objected that below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9</a>, we have the same verb in the same voice used where the meaning clearly is “to strip <span class="ital">from oneself</span>.” But classical parallels exist to such a varying use of the middle in neighbouring contexts.

It is precisely the same participle that we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>, and the writer has just used the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 11) in a corresponding sense (see note <span class="accented">in loc.</span> on the force of the double compound). He employs compounds of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> in the middle voice seventeen times elsewhere, and always in the sense of "putting off [or, 'on'] from one's self;" and there is no sure instance in Greek of the middle verb bearing any other meaning. Yet such critics as Meyer, Eadie, Klopper, cling to the rendering of the Vulgate and our Authorized Version; and not without reason, as we shall see. The Revised margin follows the earlier Latin Fathers and some ancient versions, supplying "his body" as object of the participle, understanding "Christ" as subject. But the context does not, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-3.htm">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>, suggest this ellipsis, and it is arbitrary to make the participle itself mean "having disembodied <span class="accented">himself."</span> Nor has the writer introduced any new subject since ver. 12, where" God" appears as agent of each of the acts of salvation set forth in vers. 12-15. Moreover, "the principalities and the dominions" of this verse must surely be those of ver. 10 and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a> (compare the "angels" of ver. 18). We understand St. Patti, therefore, to say "that God [revealing himself in Christ; 'in him,' 15 b] put off and put away those angelic powers through whom he had previously shown himself to men." The Old Testament associates the angels with the creation of the world and the action of the powers of nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm">Job 38:7</a>; Psalm cir. 4), and with its great theophanies generally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>, etc.); and its hints in this direction were emphasized and extended by the Greek translators of the LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38, 53</a> (St. Stephen); <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>, ascribe to them a special agency in <span class="accented">the giving of the Law.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a>. and it. show how large a place the doctrine of the mediation of angels filled in Jewish thought at this time, and how it tended to limit the mediatorship of Christ. The mystic developments of Judaism among the Essenes and the Ebionites (Christian Essenes), and in the Cabbala, are full of this belief. And it is a cornerstone of the philosophic mysticism of Alexandria. In Philo the angels are the "Divine <span class="accented">powers," "words," "images</span> of <span class="accented">God,"</span> forming the court and <span class="accented">entourage</span> of the invisible King, by whose means he created and maintains the material world, and holds converse with the souls of men (see quotation, ver. 10). This doctrine, we may suppose, was a chief article of the Colossian heresy. Theodoret's note on ver. 18 is apposite here: "They who defended the Law taught men to worship angels, saying that the Law was given by them. This mischief continued long in Phrygia and Pisidia." The apostle returns to the point from which he started in ver. 10. He has just declared that God has cancelled and removed the Law as an instrument of condemnation; and now adds that he has at the same time thrown off and laid aside the veil of angelic mediation under which, in the administration of that Law, he had withdrawn himself. Both these acts take place "in Christ." Both are necessary to that "access to the Father" which, in the <span class="accented">apostle's</span> view, is the special prerogative of Christian faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-12.htm">Ephesians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>), and which the Colossian error doubly barred, by its ascetic ceremonialism and by its angelic mediation. (See, on this passage, Alford; also Peirce's 'Paraphrase and Notes,' 2nd edit., 1729; Robertson Smith, on 'Christ and the Angels,' <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, second series, vol. 1:138, etc.; A. Sabatier's 'L'Apotre Paul,' p. 220, 2nd edit., 1881.) We are compelled, with all deference to its high authority, to reject the view of the Greek Fathers, to which Ellicott, Lightfoot, and Wordsworth have returned, according to which "Christ in his atoning death [in it; 'the cross,' ver. 15 b] stripped off from himself the Satanic powers." For it requires us to bring in, without grammatical warrant, <span class="accented">"somewhere"</span> (Lightfoot), "Christ" as subject; it puts upon" the principalities and the dominions" a sense foreign to the context, and that cannot be justified by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, where the connection is wholly different and the hostile sense of the terms is most explicitly defined; and it presents an idea harsh and unfitting in itself, the incongruity of which such illustrations as those of the <span class="accented">Nessus robe</span> and <span class="accented">Joseph's garment</span> only make more apparent. It is one thing to say that the powers of evil <span class="accented">surrounded</span> Christ and quite another thing to say that he <span class="accented">wore</span> them as we have worn "the body of the flesh" (ver. 11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a>). He made a show (of them) openly, having led them in triumph in him; or, <span class="accented">it</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21, 22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1.htm">John 1</a>:52; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>). In this, as in the last verse, we have a finite verb between two participles, one introductory ("having stripped off"), the other explanatory, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, to <span class="accented">make a show</span> or <span class="accented">example</span>, occurs in the New Testament besides only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-17.htm">Matthew 1:17</a>, where it is compounded with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> (Revised Text), giving it a sinister meaning of not belonging to the simple verb. With the angelic <span class="accented">"principalities,"</span> etc., for object, the verb denotes, not a shameful exposure, but "an exhibition of them in their true character and position," such as forbids them to be regarded superstitiously (ver. 18). God exhibited the angels as the subordinates and servants of his Son (ver. 10: camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>, etc.).

For the common acceptation of the word "triumph" compels us to think of the "principalities," etc., as <span class="accented">hostile</span> (<span class="accented">Satanic</span>); and this, again, as Meyer strongly contends, dictates the rendering "having spoiled" for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. So we are brought into collision with two fixed points of our former exegesis. If we are bound lexically to abide by the reference to the Roman military triumph, then the angelic principalities must be supposed to have stood in a quasi-hostile position to "the kingdom of God and of Christ," <span class="accented">in so far as men had exaggerated their powers and exalted them at Christ's expense</span>, and to have been now robbed of this false pre-eminence. The writer however, ventures to question whether, on philological grounds, a better, native Greek sense cannot be found for this verb. The noun <span class="accented">thriambos</span> ("triumph"), on which it is based, is used, indeed, in the Latin sense as early as Polybius, a writer on Roman history (). But it is extant in a much earlier classical fragment as synonymous with <span class="accented">dithyrambos</span>, denoting "a festal song;" and again in Plutarch, contemporary with St. Paul, it is a name of the Greek god Dionysus, in whose honour such songs were sung, and whose worship was of a choral, processional character. This kinder <span class="accented">triumph</span> was, one may imagine, familiar to the eyes of St. Paul and of his readers, while the spectacle of the Roman triumph was distant and foreign (at least when he wrote 2 Corinthians). We suggest that the apostle's image is taken, beth here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>, from <span class="accented">the festal procession</span> of the Greek divinity, who leads his worshippers along as witnesses of his power and celebrants of his glory. Such a figure fittingly describes the relation and the attitude of the angels to the Divine presence in Christ. Let this suggestion, however, be regarded as precarious or fanciful, the general exposition of the verse is not thereby invalidated. (For further elucidation, see the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 10. pp. 403-421; 11. p. 78. On "triumph," in 2 Corinthians, see Mr. Waite's <span class="accented">Additional note</span> in 'Speaker's Commentary.') The Revisers omit the marginal "in himself" of the Authorized Version, which correctly, as we think, refers the final <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> to <span class="accented">Christ</span> (ver. 10), though incorrectly implying "Christ" as subject of the verse. It was not only "in the cross" that God unveiled himself, dispensing with angelic theophanies, but in the entire person and work of his Son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>). "Which veil" (for here we may apply the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14</a>) "is done away in Christ." So the whole passage (vers. 10-15) ends, as it begins, "in him:" "We are complete in him" - in our conversion from sin to holiness set forth in baptism, and our resurrection from death to life experienced in forgiveness (vers. 11-13); and in the removal at once of the legal bar which forbade our access to God (ver. 14), and of the veil of inferior and partial mediation which obscured his manifestation to us (ver. 15). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Having spoiled principalities and powers (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>For the verb spoiled, see on putting off, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>. The principalities and powers are the angelic hosts through whose ministry the law was given. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>. Great importance was attached, in the later rabbinical schools, to the angels who assisted in giving the law; and that fact was not without influence in shaping the doctrine of angelic mediators, one of the elements of the Colossian heresy, which was partly Judaic. This doctrine Paul strikes at in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>; here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>. God put off from himself, when the bond of the law was rendered void in Christ's crucifixion, that ministry of angels which waited on the giving of the law, revealing Christ as the sole mediator, the head of every principality and power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>). The directness of the gospel ministration, as contrasted with the indirectness of the legal ministration, is touched upon by Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a> sqq.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-12.htm">2 Corinthians 3:12</a> sqq.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>.<p>He made a show of them (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19</a>, see note. The compound &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9; to expose to public infamy, is found <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-6.htm">Hebrews 6:6</a>; and &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; example, in Jde 1:7. The word is unknown to classical Greek. The meaning here is to make a display of, exhibit. He showed them as subordinate and subject to Christ. Compare especially <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-14</a> throughout, where many points of contact with the first two chapters of this epistle will be found.<p>Openly (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;)<p>Or boldly. See on Plm 1:8. Not publicly, but as by a bold stroke putting His own ministers, chosen and employed for such a glorious and dignified office, in subjection before the eyes of the world.<p>Triumphing over them (&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14</a>. If we take this phrase in the sense which it bears in that passage, leading in triumph, there seems something incongruous in picturing the angelic ministers of the law as captives of war, subjugated and led in procession. The angels "do His commandments and hearken unto the voice of His word." But while I hold to that explanation in 2 Corinthians, I see no reason why the word may not be used here less specifically in the sense of leading a festal procession in which all share the triumph; the heavenly ministers, though set aside as mediators, yet exulting in the triumph of the one and only Mediator. Even in the figure in 2 Corinthians, the captives rejoice in the triumph. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>. Our knowledge of the word &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9; is not so extensive or accurate as to warrant too strict limitations in our definition.<p>In it (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;)<p>The cross. Many expositors, however, render in Him, Christ. This I adopt as harmonizing with the emphatic references to Christ which occur in every verse from <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>; Christ, four times; in Him, four; in whom, two; with Him, three. In it is necessary only if the subject of the sentence is Christ; but the very awkward change of subject from God (quickened us together, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a>) is quite unnecessary. God is the subject throughout. </body></html>
