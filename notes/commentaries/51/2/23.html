The prefix applies in sense, though not in grammatical form, to the “humility” also; a studied humility being either a pretence or a self-degradation. But in the words “neglecting of the body” (properly, being <span class= "ital">unsparing of it</span> in hardship, and generally careless of it) we pass to the ceremonial ordinances. It is more than likely that the superstition and false asceticism were connected together—the latter being the condition of the supposed spiritual insight of the former.<p><span class= "bld">Which things . . .</span> <span class= "bld">flesh.</span>—This passage is difficult. (1) Our version translates literally, and would seem to regard the last words as simply an explanation, from the point of view of the false teachers, of “neglecting of the body,” as “not honouring it for the satisfaction, or surfeiting of the flesh;” and we certainly find that the Jewish ascetics did brand the most necessary satisfaction of appetite as a “surfeiting of the flesh.” But there is a fatal objection to this interpretation—that, in that case, St. Paul would leave the false pretension without a word of contradiction, which is almost incredible. Hence (2) we must regard the “not in any honour” as antithetical to “the show of wisdom.” The ordinances, says St. Paul, have “a show of wisdom,” but “are in no honour,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>are “of no value.” The common use of the word rendered “honour,” for “price,” or “pay” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-6.htm" title="And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.">Matthew 27:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-16.htm" title="And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.">Acts 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-19.htm" title="Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.">Acts 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm" title="You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men.">1Corinthians 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1Timothy 5:17</a>), would readily lend itself to this sense. The only doubtful point (3) is the interpretation of the last words, “for the satisfying of the flesh.” There seems little doubt that the phrase is used in a bad sense. Hence we must dismiss all reference to a right honouring of the body by innocent satisfaction of its needs. We have therefore to choose between two interpretations. Some interpret “of no value <span class= "ital">against</span> the satisfaction of the flesh.” But, though the Greek will bear this sense, it is certainly not the common sense of the preposition used; and its adoption would expose the whole phrase to the charge of ambiguity and obscurity. The other interpretation is “of no real value” (tending) “to the satisfaction of the flesh.” This is abrupt, but suits well the indignant and abrupt terseness of the passage. It gives (quite after St. Paul’s manner) not only a denial of the “neglecting of the body,” but a retort on the false teachers of the very charge they made against their opponents. (Comp. the use of the word “dogs,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2</a>.) It conveys a most important truth. That “extremes meet” we know well; and that there is a satisfaction of the fleshly temper (see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>) in the attempt over much to curb the flesh, the whole history of asceticism bears witness. Moreover, this interpretation alone gives a completeness of antithesis. To “the show of wisdom” it opposes the “no real value;” to the pretended “neglecting of the body” the real” satisfaction of the flesh.”<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 It looked like humility to apply to angels, as if men were conscious of their unworthiness to speak directly to God. But it is not warrantable; it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it to a creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those who worship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, to use any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is a growing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of the world. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel; in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church. Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommon spirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not in any honour to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy the carnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness, and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them so much as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul no good, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh. What the Lord has left indifferent, let us regard as such, and leave others to the like freedom; and remembering the passing nature of earthly things, let us seek to glorify God in the use of them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which things - Which scrupulous observance of the numerous precepts enjoining rites and ceremonies, the observance of days, and the distinctions between meats and drinks.<p>Have indeed a show of wisdom - Have a great appearance of piety and of regard for the will of God They have a show of "wisdom," too, or of a deep acquaintance with divine things. They who insist on them appear to be learned in what constitutes religion, and to have a deep insight into its mysteries. Doubtless they who urged the obligation of these things laid claim to uncommon acquaintance with the nature of religion, and urged the observance of these things on the ground of their tendency to promote piety, just as they always do who insist much on the observance of religious rites and ceremonies.<p>In will-worship - Voluntary worship; i. e., worship beyond what God strictly requires-supererogatory service. Probably many of these things they did not urge as being strictly required, but as conducing greatly to piety. The plea doubtless was, that piety might be promot ed by service rendered beyond what was absolutely enjoined, and that thus there would be evinced a spirit of uncommon piety - a readiness not only to obey all that God required, but even to go beyond this, and to render him voluntary service. There is much plausibility in this; and this has been the foundation of the appointment of the fasts and festivals of the church; of penances and self-inflicted tortures; of painful vigils and pilgrimages; of works of supererogation, and of the merits of the "saints." A large part of the corruptions of religion have arisen from this plausible but deceitful argument. God knew best what things it was most conducive to piety for his people to observe; and we are most safe when we adhere most closely to what he has appointed, and observe no more days and ordinances than he has directed. There is much apparent piety about these things; but there is much wickedness of heart at the bottom, and there is nothing that more tends to corrupt pure religion.<p>And humility - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>. There is a great show of reverence for divine things in the manner in which they pursue their investigations, and in their humble and meek compliance with painful rites and ceremonies; in fastings, abstinence, and penances. Under all this there lurks often the worst kind of pride; because:<p>"Pride may be pampered while the flesh grows lean."<p>And neglecting the body - Putting on sackcloth and ashes; subjecting it to painful fastings and penances; appearing in a form of squalid poverty, as if the body were not worth regarding, and as if the attention were so much engrossed by the nobler care of the soul, as to be entirely regardless of the body. Yet, we may observe,<p>(1) God made the body as well as the soul, and has shown his care of it by its" being fearfully and wonderfully made," and by all the provision which he has made for all its needs.<p>(2) Religion pertains to the body as well as the soul, and should teach a man properly to regard it. Man is bound so to take care of the body, as to have the most health and the longest life possible in the service of his Creator, and so as to be able to employ it in the best manner. There is no religion in ragged or squalid clothing, in a dirty face, in offensive personal habits, in filth and defilement, and in setting at defiance the decencies of life.<p>(3) much affected sanctity may exist where there is a most proud and corrupt heart. A long face, a demure countenance, a studied disregard of the decencies of dress and the courtesies of life, as if they were unworthy of notice, may be the exponent of the most hateful pride, and of the basest purposes of the soul. A man should be on his guard always against one who, under pretence of extraordinary sanctity, professes to despise the ordinary dress and usages of society.<p>Not in any honour - That is, there is no real honor in these things; there is nothing to ennoble and elevate the soul; nothing that is to be commended.<p>To the satisfying of the flesh - The only effect is, to satisfy or please the flesh; that is, the carnal and corrupt nature, for so the word "flesh" is often used in the Scriptures. The effect of these observances, on which so much stress is laid as if they would promote piety, is merely to gratify pride, self-righteousness, the love of distinction, and the other carnal propensities of our nature. There seems to be a great deal of humility and piety in them; there is really little else than pride, selfishness, and ambition.<p>Remarks On <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a><p>1. We should feel a deep interest for the welfare of other Christians, even those whom we have never seen; <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-1.htm">Colossians 2:1-2</a>. All belong to the same family, have the same enemies to contend with, are engaged in the same warfare, are traveling to the same heaven. By our prayers and sympathy, we may often do much good to those whom we shall never see until we meet them in heaven.<p>2. We should be on our guard against the seductive arts of false teachers. They are often plausible; they can urge arguments which we may not be able to answer; they may have much more learning than we have; and they may put on the appearance of great humility and of real piety; <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3-4</a>.3. It is, in general, a safe rule for a Christian to abide by the views which he had on the great subjects of religion when he became converted; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>. Then the heart was tender and soft - like wax - and received the impression which the Spirit made on it. There are some things in which the heart judges better than the head; and in which we are quite as likely to go right if we follow the former as we are the latter. In relation to the performance of many of the duties of life - the duties of kindness and charity - the heart is often a more safe guide than the head; and so in many things pertaining more immediately to religion, a man is more likely to judge right if he follows the promptings of his feelings in the happiest moments of piety, than he is to wait for the more cool and cautious course of argument. The same thing may be true even of many of the doctrines of religion. When a poor sinner trembles on the verge of hell, he feels that none but an Almighty Saviour can deliver him, and he goes and commits himself to Jesus as God - and he is not in much danger of erring in that. He will be more likely to be drawn aside from the truth by the artful reasonings of the advocates of error, than he will by his feelings at that moment.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. have&#8212;Greek, "are having"; implying the permanent characteristic which these ordinances are supposed to have.<p>show of wisdom&#8212;rather, "a reputation of wisdom" [Alford].<p>will-worship&#8212;arbitrarily invented worship: would-be worship, devised by man's own will, not God's. So jealous is God of human will-worship, that He struck Nadab and Abihu dead for burning strange incense (Le 10:1-3). So Uzziah was stricken with leprosy for usurping the office of priest (2Ch 26:16-21). Compare the will-worship of Saul (1Sa 13:8-14) for which he was doomed to lose his throne. This "voluntary worship" is the counterpart to their "voluntary humility" (Col 2:18): both specious in appearance, the former seeming in religion to do even more than God requires (as in the dogmas of the Roman and Greek churches); but really setting aside God's will for man's own; the latter seemingly self-abasing, but really proud of man's self-willed "humility" (Greek, "lowliness of mind"), while virtually rejecting the dignity of direct communion with Christ, the Head; by worshipping of angels.<p>neglecting of the body&#8212;Greek, "not sparing of the body." This asceticism seems to have rested on the Oriental theory that matter is the source of evil. This also looked plausible (compare 1Co 9:27).<p>not in any honour&#8212;of the body. As "neglecting of the body" describes asceticism positively; so this clause, negatively. Not paying any of that "honor" which is due to the body as redeemed by such a price as the blood of Christ. We should not degrade, but have a just estimation of ourselves, not in ourselves, but in Christ (Ac 13:46; 1Co 3:21; 6:15; 7:23; 12:23, 24; 1Th 4:4). True self-denial regards the spirit, and not the forms of ascetical self-mortification in "meats which profit not those occupied therein" (Heb 13:9), and is consistent with Christian self-respect, the "honor" which belongs to the believer as dedicated to the Lord. Compare "vainly," Col 2:18.<p>to the satisfying of the flesh&#8212;This expresses the real tendency of their human ordinances of bodily asceticism, voluntary humility, and will-worship of angels. While seeming to deny self and the body, they really are pampering the flesh. Thus "satisfying of the flesh" answers to "puffed up by his fleshly mind" (Col 2:18), so that "flesh" is used in its ethical sense, "the carnal nature" as opposed to the "spiritual"; not in the sense, "body." The Greek for "satisfying" implies satiating to repletion, or to excess. "A surfeit of the carnal sense is human tradition" [Hilary the Deacon, in Bengel]. Tradition puffs up; it clogs the heavenly perceptions. They put away true "honor" that they may "satiate to the full THE FLESH." Self-imposed ordinances gratify the flesh (namely, self-righteousness), though seeming to mortify it.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Which things have indeed a show of wisdom:</span> by way of concession the apostle here grants that the precepts and doctrines of men about religious abstinences had a <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">show of wisdom; </span> and it was but a mere show, a bare pretext, a specious appearance, a fair colour of wisdom, which is of no worth, not the reality and truth of Christian wisdom, however it might beguile those that were taken more with shadows than substance, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm" title=" In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.">Colossians 2:3</a>,4,8,17</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In will-worship; </span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

II. p. 257; from Polyb. in Schweighäuser, <span class="ital">Lex</span>. p. 370[134]), in which case the ground may certainly be only an apparent one, a pretext (comp.

The latter signification is here to be adhered to, because the subsequent <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἘΝ ΤΙΜῇ ΤΙΝΙ</span></span></span>, when correctly rendered, accords with it as bearing on the matter in hand, and is in sense appropriately correlative.

See Erasmus, <span class="ital">Annot</span>., and generally Winer, p. 534 f. [E. T. 719]; Buttmann, <span class="ital">Neut. Gr</span>. p. 313 [E.

The linguistic phenomenon of this <span class="greekheb">μέν</span> without an adversative word following is so common, that there is no ground for requiring before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἘΝ ΤΙΜῇ Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> an <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛΆ</span></span></span> (Hofmann), which <span class="ital">might</span> have been used (Baeumlein, p. 170), but not <span class="ital">necessarily</span>. Holtzmann also takes too much offence at the absence of a formal contrast, and finds in <span class="greekheb">πρὸς πλησμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σαρκός</span> an ill-inserted remnant of the original.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἘΘΕΛΟΘΡΗΣΚΕΊᾼ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">instrumental</span>, specifying by what means it is brought about, on the part of those who lay down the commandments and doctrines referred to, that the latter have a repute of wisdom: <span class="ital">through self-chosen worship, i.e</span>. through a cultus, which is not divinely commanded, but is the work of their own self-determination. What was <span class="ital">meant</span> by this, the reader was <span class="ital">aware;</span> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a> places it beyond doubt that the worship of <span class="ital">angels</span> formed an essential and chief part of it, though it need not, from the general character of the expression in our passage, have been meant exclusively; other forms of capricious cultus may have been included with it. The <span class="ital">substantive</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐθελοθρ</span>. <span class="ital">does not occur elsewhere except in ecclesiastical writers; but the verb</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐθελοθρησκεῖν</span> is explained by Suidas: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἸΔΊῼ ΘΕΛΉΜΑΤΙ ΣΈΒΕΙΝ ΤῸ ΔΟΚΟῦΝ</span></span></span>, and Epiph. <span class="ital">Haer</span>. i. 16 explains the name Pharisees: <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸ ἀφωρισμένους εἶναι αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν ἄλλων διὰ τὴν ἐθελοπερισσοθρησκείαν παρʼ αὐτοῖς νενομισμένην</span>. Comp. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΘΕΛΟΔΟΥΛΕΊΑ</span></span></span> (Plat. <span class="ital">Symp</span>. p. 184 C, <span class="ital">Rep</span>. p. 562 D), <span class="greekheb">ἐθελοκάκησις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐθελοκίνδυνος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐθελόπορος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐθελοπρόξενος</span> (Thuc. iii. 70. 2, where the scholiast explains: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΦʼ ἙΑΥΤΟῦ ΓΕΝΌΜΕΝΟς ΚΑῚ ΜῊ ΚΕΛΕΥΣΘΕῚς Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>.), and various others. Hofmann erroneously takes away from the word in itself the bad sense, and explains (after the analogy of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΘΕΛΟΠΟΝΊΑ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΘΕΛΟΥΡΓΊΑ</span></span></span>): worship, <span class="ital">which one interests himself in</span>. This view is prohibited by the evident retrospective reference of this word and the following one to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>, where, according to the right interpretation, the <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span> was certainly something bad. The unfavourable meaning, according to Hofmann’s present explanation (he gave a different but also erroneous view in his <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 72; see, in opposition to it, my third edition), is only got by the addition of <span class="greekheb">σώματος</span>, which belongs to <span class="ital">all the three</span> points, so that <span class="greekheb">ἐθελοθρησκεία σώματος</span> must be understood as a worship gladly and earnestly rendered, <span class="ital">but which is rendered only with bodily demeanour</span>. But <span class="greekheb">σώματος</span> does not suit either with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΘΕΛΟΘΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΑΠΕΙΝΟΦΡ</span></span></span>.,[135] but only with <span class="greekheb">ἀφειδίᾳ</span>. For it is plain from <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΦΕΙΔΊᾼ ΣΏΜΑΤΟς</span></span></span> that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΏΜΑΤΟς</span></span></span> is the genitive of the <span class="ital">object</span>, from which it follows that <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία σώματος</span> would yield the opposite sense: a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΡΗΣΚΕΊΑ</span></span></span> <span class="ital">rendered to the body</span> (comp. <span class="greekheb">θρησκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἀγγέλων</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>), which would come ultimately to the idea of the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΑΤΡΕΎΕΙΝ Τῇ ἩΔΟΝῇ</span></span></span> (Lucian, <span class="ital">Nigr</span>. 15), comp.

Sic. xiii. 60.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἘΝ ΤΙΜῇ ΤΙΝΙ</span></span></span>] <span class="ital">not through anything whatever that is an honour</span>, not through anything honourable, by which that repute would appear founded in truth and just. The expression is <span class="ital">purposely chosen</span>, in order to make the <span class="greekheb">λόγος σοφίας</span> appear as <span class="ital">repute without honour, i.e</span>. without any morally estimable substratum on the part of the persons concerned. The following <span class="greekheb">πρὸς πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός</span> is also purposely chosen; in it <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΗΣΜΟΝ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> significantly glances back to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΦΕΙΔΊᾼ</span></span></span>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῆς ΣΑΡΚΌς</span></span></span> to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΏΜΑΤΟς</span></span></span>, and there is produced a thoughtful contrast, a striking ethical oxymoron: <span class="ital">for the sake of fully satisfying the flesh</span>. Those commandments and doctrines have a repute of wisdom, etc., <span class="ital">in order to afford thereby full satisfaction to the material-psychical human nature</span>. Thus, while the repute of wisdom is procured among other things by <span class="ital">mortifying</span> the <span class="ital">body</span>, the <span class="ital">flesh is satisfied;</span> the fleshly sinful lust of these men gets <span class="ital">fully satisfying nourishment</span> conveyed to it, when they see that their doctrines and commandments pass for wise. <span class="ital">What</span> lust of the flesh it is which Paul has in view, is placed beyond doubt by the case itself and also by <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>, namely, that of religious <span class="ital">conceit and pride</span>, which through the <span class="greekheb">λόγον σοφίας ἔχειν</span> feels itself flattered and gratified in the fancy of peculiar perfection. This interpretation, which we have given of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἘΝ ΤΙΜῇ ΤΙΝΙ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΠΡῸς ΠΛΗΣΜΟΝῊΝ Τῆς ΣΑΡΚΌς</span></span></span>, is held in substance, following Hilary (“sagina carnalis sensus traditio humana est”), by Bengel, Storr, Flatt, Böhmer, Steiger, Bähr, Huther, Dalmer, Bleek, and others. Most, however, refer <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΤΙΜῇ ΤΙΝΙ</span></span></span> to the honour to be shown to the <span class="ital">body</span> (or the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>, see Luther), and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡῸς ΠΛΗΣΜ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΣΑΡΚ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> to <span class="ital">bodily satisfaction</span>, so that the sense results: <span class="ital">not in some esteeming of the body to the satisfying of bodily wants;</span>[136] “sentit apost., sapientiam illam aut praecepta talia esse, per quae corpori debitus honor, pertinens ad expletionem, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. justam refectionem carnis, subtrahatur,” Estius. So, in substance, Chrysostom, Theodore of Mopsuestia, Theodoret, Oceumenius, Theophylact, Pelagius, Erasmus, Luther, Melanchthon, Calvin, Musculus, Clarius, Zeger, Erasmus Schmid, Zanchius, Vatablus, Calovius, Cornelius a Lapide, Wolf, Michaelis, Nösselt, Rosenmüller, and others, including de Wette and Baumgarten-Crusius. It is fatal to this view:—(1) that <span class="greekheb">ἐν τιμῇ τινι</span>, as is shown by the repetition of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span>, is the contrast not merely to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἈΦΕΙΔΊᾼ ΣΏΜΑΤΟς</span></span></span>, but to the entire connected <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἘΘΕΛΟΘΡΗΣΚΕΊᾼ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΣΏΜΑΤΟς</span></span></span>, and hence the reference to the honour to be shown to the <span class="ital">body</span> does not seem justified by the context;[137] (2) further, that for the designation of the mere <span class="ital">satisfaction</span> at this particular place, where Paul could only have had a <span class="greekheb">πρόνοιαν τῆς σαρκός</span> in view, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm" title="But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.">Romans 13:14</a>, the term <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΗΣΜΟΝΉΝ</span></span></span> would be very inappropriate, especially in contradistinction to the mortifications of the false teachers, since it denotes <span class="ital">filling up, satisfying fully</span>, even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-3.htm" title="And the children of Israel said to them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for you have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.">Exodus 16:3</a> (see generally the passages from the LXX. and Apocrypha quoted by Schleusner, <span class="ital">Thes</span>. IV. p. 375 f.); comp. Plat. <span class="ital">Legg</span>. viii. p. 837: Xen. <span class="ital">Mem</span>. iii. 11. 14, <span class="ital">rep.

Saturn</span>. 28; Polyb. ii. 19. 4; (3) finally, that the interchange of <span class="greekheb">σώματος</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΑΡΚΌς</span></span></span>, in the event of the latter not being meant in an ethical character, would seem to be without a motive, while, according to our view, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΑΡΚΌς</span></span></span> stands in as ingenious correlation with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΏΜΑΤΟς</span></span></span>, as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΛΗΣΜΟΝΉΝ</span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΦΕΙΔΊᾼ</span></span></span>. These arguments apply also in opposition to Ewald’s view; “what seems very wise, but is <span class="ital">in no value whatever</span>, is rather quite useless <span class="ital">for the satisfaction of the flesh</span>, which yet also demands its rights, if man would not wantonly disorganize his earthly life or even destroy it” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-3.htm" title="For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:">2 Corinthians 10:3</a>). Hofmann finally takes <span class="greekheb">πλησμονὴ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σαρκός</span> rightly, but explains <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ἘΝ ΤΙΜῇ ΤΙΝΙ</span></span></span> in such a way as to make <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΙΝΙ</span></span></span> <span class="ital">masculine</span>, and to attach it as appropriating dative to <span class="greekheb">τιμῇ</span>: “<span class="ital">not so that honour accrues to any one</span>.” This is to be rejected, because Paul, instead of simply and clearly writing <span class="greekheb">τιμῇ τινος</span>, would only have expressed himself in a way singularly liable to be misunderstood by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΙΝΊ</span></span></span>, which every reader was led to join as a feminine with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΙΜῇ</span></span></span> (“in honore aliquo,” Vulgate).

This may be taken in the sense of “a word of wisdom,” but with no inner truth. Others translate “appearance of wisdom” (Beng., De W. and others). But this seems not to be a meaning of <span class="greekheb">λόγ</span>. Klöpper’s translation, “reason” or “ground,” yields no very good sense. It is best, with most recent commentators, to translate “a reputation for wisdom”. <span class="greekheb">μέν</span> is not followed by <span class="greekheb">δε</span>, but this is not uncommon (see Winer-Moulton, pp. 719–721).—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐθελοθρησκείᾳ καὶ ταπεινοφροσύνῃ καὶ ἀφειδίᾳ σώματος</span>. It is impossible to connect <span class="greekheb">σώμ</span>. with all three datives (Hofm.), it can belong only to <span class="greekheb">ἀφειδίᾳ</span>, with which it is connected as an objective genitive, “severity to the body”. If <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> is retained before <span class="greekheb">ἀφ</span>. the sense of the earlier datives is not affected. If, however, it is omitted their sense may be affected. It is possible to take <span class="greekheb">ἀφ</span>., then, as an instrumental dative with <span class="greekheb">λόγον ἔχοντα</span>. But it is also possible to take it, with Haupt, as an explanatory apposition to the earlier datives. In this case <span class="greekheb">ἐθελ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ταπ</span>. have both an ascetic meaning. Against this, however, is the fact that the words cannot be separated from the parallel expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>. This seems to fix the sense of <span class="greekheb">ἐθελ</span>. as a worship of angels, which was not required of them, and <span class="greekheb">ταπ</span>. will mean what it meant in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐθελοθρ</span>. occurs nowhere else, and was probably coined by Paul. Similar compounds were not unusual, and generally, though not invariably, had a bad sense. This is commonly supposed to attach to this word, but in any case it gets a bad sense from its context. <span class="greekheb">ἀφ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σώμ</span>. is the clearest assertion we have of the ascetic character of the false teachings.—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ τινί</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρὸς πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός</span>. These words, which constitute this verse one of the most difficult in the New Testament, have received very various explanations. It is disputed whether <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ τ</span>. should be connected with the preceding or following words, and also with what <span class="greekheb">πρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πλησ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σαρκός</span> should be connected. Sumner, followed by Conybeare and Evans on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>, interpreted <span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span> as meaning “to check,” and translated “not in any value to check the indulgence of the flesh,” connecting <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. with the following words. This view was adopted by Lightfoot, and has been accepted by Moule and now by Ellicott. It has been inserted, with altogether insufficient warning, in R.V. It is a new explanation, and since propounded has found comparatively little favour. Lightfoot quotes numerous examples to prove that <span class="greekheb">πρός</span> after words denoting value, utility, sufficiency, etc., is used in the sense “to check” or “to prevent”. But in these cases the meaning does not lie in <span class="greekheb">πρός</span>, but in <span class="greekheb">πρός</span> after some word which imposes this sense upon it (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <span class="greekheb">φάρμακον</span>), and there is nothing of the kind here. Abbott, in his valuable criticism of this interpretation, points out that <span class="greekheb">πρός</span> means “with a view to,” and if the object is a word signifying action or the production of an effect it will mean with a view to (producing). “Hence it seems to follow that unless <span class="greekheb">πλησμονή</span> be taken in the sense of ‘a state of repletion,’ which would be unsuitable, <span class="greekheb">πρὸς πλησμονήν</span> could only mean to produce <span class="greekheb">πλ</span>.” A further question relates to the use of <span class="greekheb">τιμῇ</span>. Our word “value” is ambiguous, and <span class="greekheb">τιμή</span> may mean “value” in the sense of “price”. But in this interpretation it is used in the sense of “efficacy,” and this sense needs to be established. It seems necessary to reject this explanation on linguistic grounds. But the sense it yields is less good than appears at first sight. For what would be said would be that these things had a reputation for wisdom in “will-worship,” etc., but they had not a reputation for wisdom in any value against the indulgence of the flesh. But obviously this cannot be the meaning. The sense imposed “but have not any value” can only be got out of the words by straining them. Another view, which keeps the same connexion of words, is that the translation should be “not in any honour to it [<span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the body] to satisfy the [reasonable] wants of the flesh”. This must be rejected because <span class="greekheb">πλ</span>. is not used in this good sense, and <span class="greekheb">σαρκός</span> cannot be used as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">σώματος</span> in a context where <span class="greekheb">σώμ</span>. has been used just before, for the terms must stand in emphatic contrast. Soden and Abbott translate “not in any honour for the full satisfaction of the flesh”. This means that there is no real honour, but what there is, is such as to satisfy the carnal nature. So Meyer, not in any honour, but serving to satiate the flesh. The objection to this view is that <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> at least is required before <span class="greekheb">πρὸς πλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σαρκός</span>. Alford connects <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. with the preceding words, but <span class="greekheb">πρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ς</span>. with <span class="greekheb">δογματίζεσθε</span>. This gives a fairly good sense, and requires no necessary words to be supplied, but the parenthesis is incredibly long. A less lengthy parenthesis is involved in the interpretation of Bähr, Eadie and Weiss: “Which things, having indeed a reputation of wisdom in will-worship and humility and severity to the body, not in any honour, are for the indulgence of the flesh”. If the contrast is between severity to the body and honour to it, we should have expected <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> after <span class="greekheb">τιμῇ</span>. It is also strange that <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> should be placed before <span class="greekheb">τιμῇ</span> and not before <span class="greekheb">ἀφειδ</span>. And the meaning is not probable, for it is implied that Paul thought that a reputation for wisdom ought to rest on honour to the body, which is absurd. Findlay’s view, “not in any honour, against surfeiting of the flesh,” not only yields a thought most obscurely expressed, but must be rejected because of its translation of <span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span>. All these interpretations are open to serious if not fatal objections. It is therefore not unlikely that Hort is right in the suspicion, shared also by Haupt, that we have to do here with a primitive corruption, for which no probable emendation has been suggested. He thinks that the text of the Epistle, and especially of the second chapter, was badly preserved in ancient times.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">which</span> things] More precisely, if the word may be tolerated, <span class="bld">which-like things</span>; the prohibitions given above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-21.htm" title=" (Touch not; taste not; handle not;">Colossians 2:21</a>, and all others which depend on the same principle.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have indeed</span>] More precisely, <span class="bld">do indeed have</span>, with a slight emphasis on the admission.

The special direction of this false humility here would be, perhaps, that of abject submission to Pharisaic “directors,” mistaken for a true surrender to the will of God.—“Who can submit our will to the will of God, save the Spirit of God?” (Quesnel).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neglecting of the body</span>] Lit., <span class="bld">unsparing (treatment) of the body; a</span> severe and active physical asceticism.—Something of Oriental <span class="ital">dualism</span> may well have influenced this ascetic practice.

It satisfies the context as no other does, supplying just such a counterpart as might be expected (from the use of the word “<span class="ital">indeed</span>,” <span class="greekheb">μὲν</span>) to the admission that the system had “a shew of wisdom.” See Lightfoot’s note for full proof that the Greek preposition (<span class="greekheb">πρὸς</span>) is rightly rendered (perhaps we may better say <span class="ital">explained</span>) “<span class="ital">against</span>” in such a context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Other interpretations are as follows; (<span class="ital">a</span>) “<span class="ital">to satisfy the</span> (<span class="ital">reasonable</span>) <span class="ital">wants of the body</span>.” But this gives a <span class="ital">good</span> meaning to the Greek word rendered by A.V. “<span class="ital">satisfy</span>,” whereas it has by usage a meaning of excess and indulgence.—In this explanation, the words “<span class="ital">not in any honour</span>” are taken as a clause apart, parallel with the words just previous; “not (<span class="ital">holding the body</span>) in any honour.”—(<span class="ital">b</span>) An explanation which supposes St Paul to put the case from his opponent’s view-point: “<span class="ital">it being no worthy thing to regard the satisfaction of the flesh</span>.” This is the hesitating exposition of Theodore of Mopsuestia (cent. 4–5).—(<span class="ital">c</span>) An explanation which, like (<span class="ital">a</span>), breaks the last clause into two: “<span class="ital">not of any</span> (<span class="ital">real</span>) <span class="ital">value</span>, (<span class="ital">but</span>) <span class="ital">tending only to gratify the flesh</span>,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to inflate the pride of unregenerate man.

The antecedent of "such as" is "command merits and teachings" (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott), not "decrees" (ver. 21). For ver. 22 supplies the immediate antecedent, and the wider sense thus given is necessary to support the comprehensive and summary import of ver. 23. The Greek "are having" brings into view the nature and qualities of the subject, in accordance with <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">such as</span>, the <span class="accented">qualitative</span> relative (comp. <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>; see Moulton's Winer, pp. 209, 210; also Meyer and Ellicott, on the grammatical point). A certain "word of wisdom" was ascribed to the false teachers in ver. 4 (note the play upon <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in St. Paul's Greek). They were plausible dealers in words, and had the jargon of philosophy at their tongue's end (ver. 8, compare note on <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 18). On this the apostle had first remarked in his criticism of their teaching, and to this he first, adverts in his final <span class="accented">resume.</span> "Word of wisdom" is one of the "gifts of the Spirit" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>; but the disparaging <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">indeed</span>, with the emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> throwing <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> into the shade, in view also of the censures already passed in vers. 4, 8, puts a condemnatory sense upon the phrase: "having <span class="accented">word</span> indeed of wisdom" - "that and nothing more, no inner truth, no pith and substance of wisdom" (so Chrysostom and OEcumenius). "Word and deed," "word and truth," form a standing antithesis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-18.htm">Romans 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-19.htm">1 Corinthians 4:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>, etc.), the second member of which supplies itself to the mind; and the <span class="accented">solitary</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> in such a connection is a well-established classical idiom (see Winer's or A. Buttmann's 'Grammar;' also Meyer). It is superfluous, therefore, as well as confusing to the order of thought, to seek in the sequel for the missing half of the antithesis. Other renderings of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> - "show" (English A.V., Bengel, De Wette), "ground" or "reason" (Vulgate, Klopper), <span class="accented">"reputation"</span> (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot) - are partly doubtful or exceptional in point of usage, and partly overlook the pointed reference of vers. 22, 23 to the language of vers. 4 and 8. And the combination of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> into a single phrase is scarcely justified here in face of the established Pauline association of "word" and "wisdom" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17-2:16</a>, as well as 1 Corinthians 12:8). Both in this Epistle and in 1 Corinthians the writer is contending against forms of error which found their account in the Greek love of eloquence and of dexterous word-play. While the first part of the predicate, therefore, explains the <span class="accented">intellectual attractiveness</span> of the Colossian error, the clause next following accounts for its <span class="accented">religious fascination</span>; and the third part of the verse strikes at the root of its <span class="accented">ethical and practical applications.</span> (Shown) <span class="cmt_word">in</span> (or, <span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>devotion to</span> (or, <span class="accented">delight in</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>worship</span> (or, <span class="accented">voluntary worship</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and lowliness of mind</span> (ver. 18). The preposition "in" brings us into the moral and religious sphere of life in which this would be wisdom of doctrine had its range and found its application. The prefix <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;</span>  =  - of<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ordinarily connotes" willingness" rather than "wilfulness;" and the "delighting in worship" of ver. 18 (see note) points strongly in this direction. As against Ellicott and Lightfoot on the etymological point, see Hofmann, pp. 102, 103. Only so far as the <span class="accented">worship</span> in question (see note, ver. 18, on "worship") is evil, can the <span class="accented">having a will to worship</span> be evil. The other characteristics of the error marked in this verse seem to be recommendations, and "devotion to worship" is in keeping with them. This disposition, moreover, has an air of "humility," which does not belong to a <span class="accented">self-imposed, arbitrary worship.</span> There is a love of worship for mere worship's sake which is a perversion of the religious instinct, and tends to multiply both the forms and objects of devotion. This spurious religiousness took the form, in the Colossian errorists, of <span class="accented">worship paid to the angels.</span> On this particular worship the apostle passed his judgment in ver. 18, and now points out the tendency from which it springs. In ver. 18 "humility" precedes; here it follows "worship," by way of transition from the religious to the moral aspect of the now teaching. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (or, <span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unsparing treatment of</span> (the) body - <span class="cmt_word">not in any honour</span> (as) <span class="cmt_word">against surfeiting of the flesh</span> (vers. 16, 21, 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-23.htm">1 Corinthians 12:23-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>). The "and" linking this clause to the last under the government of "in," is textually doubtful; Lightfoot cancels it; Westcott and Hort give the omission as a secondary reading. Mr. Hort regards the passage, like ver. 18, as hopelessly corrupt - a verdict which we would fain believe is too despairing. If <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> be struck out, then <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> must be attached, somewhat loosely, to the principal predicate (" are having") as an instrumental dative. On either construction, the sense appears to be that it was its combination of ascetic rigour with religious devotion that gave to the system in question its undoubted charm, and furnished an adequate field for the eloquence and philosophical skill of its advocate. '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">unsparingness</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">surfeiting - both</span> found only here in the New Testament - and along with them "body" and "flesh," stand opposed to each other. This clause, therefore, contains a complete sense, and we must not look outside it for an explanation of the included words, "not in any honour." As we have seen, the first clause of the predicate (" having word indeed," etc.) needs no such complement. The clause "not .... flesh" is a comment on the words, "unsparing treatment of the body." On this topic the apostle had not yet expressed his mind sufficiently. He has in vers. 16, 20-22 denounced certain ascetic rules as obsolete, or as trifling and needless; but he has yet to expose the principle and tendency from which they sprang. He is the more bound to be explicit on this subject inasmuch as there were ascetic leanings in his own teaching, and passages in his earlier Epistles such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, which the "philosophical" party might net unnaturally wrest to their own purposes. He could not condemn severity to the body absolutely, and in every sense. The Colossian rigorism he does condemn - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as not <span class="accented">in keeping with bodily self-respect</span>, which is the safeguard of Christian purity; and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as not in reality <span class="accented">directed against sensual indulgence</span>, the prevention of which is the proper end of rules of abstinence. These two objections are thrown into a single terse, energetic negative clause, obscure, like so much in this chapter, from its brevity and want of connecting particles. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a> the phrase, "in honour," occurs in a similar connection: "That each one of you know how to 'gain possession of his own vessel" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to become master of his body:" see Wordsworth and Alford on the passage; also Meyer's reference on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>) "in sanctification and <span class="accented">honor"</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13-20</a> for the apostle's teaching respecting the dignity of the human body; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19-21</a>). The contempt of Alexandrine theosophists for physical nature was fatal to morality, undermining the basis on which rests the government of the body as the "vessel" and vesture of the spiritual life. Their principles took effect, first, in a morbid and unnatural asceticism; then, by a sure reaction, and with equal consistency, in unrestrained and shocking licence. See, for the latter result, the Epistles to the seven Churches of Asia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2.htm">Romans 2</a>. and 3.); in the Pastoral Epistles, the two opposite effects are both signalized. The rendering "value" given by Lightfoot and the Revisers seems to us misleading; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> means "value" only in the sense of "price," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>, and this surely is not their meaning. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span> has been taken in a milder sense by the Greek commentators, Luther, and others: "satisfaction" "(<span class="accented">legitimate</span>) gratification." So the apostle is made to charge the false teachers with "not honouring the body, so as to grant the flesh its due gratification." But this rendering confounds the "body" and the "flesh," here contrasted, and gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span> a meaning without lexical warrant (see Meyer and Lightfoot). And the sentiment it expresses errs on the anti-ascetic side, and comes into collision with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, in the LXX and in Philo, as in earlier Greek, denotes "physical repletion," and is associated with drunkenness and sensual excess generally. Hence we cannot admit the interpretation of Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, who make the "flesh" here the <span class="accented">sinful principle</span> generally, and understand "surfeiting" figuratively, supposing the apostle to mean, that the ascetic rules in question, while they dishonour the body, tend to gratify the carnal mind." This gives an idea true in itself, and agreeing with the sense of "flesh" in vers. 11, 18, but out of place here, while it strains the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> (see Lightfoot's exhaustive argument). The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> does not help us, meaning "for" or "against," according to its connection. We combine Lightfoot's interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> with Wordsworth's and <span class="accented">Alford's</span> of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;</span>. The saying of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19</a> ("whose god is their belly, and their glory in their shame") contains the same opposition of "honour" to "fleshly indulgence" as that supposed here, possibly suggested by the phrase, "surfeiting of dishonor" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), of the LXX in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-16.htm">Habakkuk 2:16</a>. Here, then, the apostle lays hold of the root principle of the false teachers' whole scheme of morality, its <span class="accented">hostility to the body as a material organism.</span> Such a treatment, he declares, dishonours the body, while it fails, and for this very reason, to prevent <span class="accented">that feeding of the flesh</span>, the fostering of sensual appetency and habit, in which lies our real peril and dishonour in regard to this vessel of our earthly life. Here we have a suitable starting-point for the exhortations of the next chapter, where the apostle, in vers. 1-4, shows the true path of deliverance from sensual sin, and in vers. 5-7 sets forth the Christian asceticism - "unsparing treatment" <span class="accented">of the flesh</span> indeed! The line of teaching adopted by the errorists may be illustrated by Philo's doctrine in his third book of the 'Allegories of the Sacred Law,' &sect; 22: "'God saw that Er was wicked;' for he knows that this <span class="accented">leathern burden</span> of ours, the body - for <span class="accented">Er</span>, being interpreted, is <span class="accented">leathern</span>  - is evil and always plotting against the soul; and it is ever under the power of death, indeed actually dead [comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>]. Yet this all do not see, but only God, and those he loves. For when the mind [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span> comp. note, ver. 18] becomes engaged in sublime contemplations and is initiated into the mysteries of the Lord [note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>], it judges the body to be evil and hostile;" again ('On the Change of Names,' &sect; 4): "Pale and wasted,  and reduced to skeletons as it were, are the men devoted to instruction, having transferred to the powers of the soul their bodily vigour also, so that they have become, as we might say, dissolved into a single form of being, that of pure soul made bodiless by force of thought [<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-21.htm">Colossians 1:21</a>, note]. In them the earthly is destroyed and overwhelmed, when reason [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>: ver. 18], pervading them wholly, has see its choice on being well pleasing to God."

Thus Thucydides says that Pithias acted as &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; voluntary agent or representative of the Athenians (iii., 70). &#x395;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; is running voluntarily into danger, foolhardy: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is voluntary slavery. The idea of pretense seems to be involved here along with that of self-chosen worship.<p>Humility<p>Voluntary and affected.<p>And neglecting (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;)<p>Only here in the New Testament. From &#x3b1;&#787; not and &#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; to spare. Hence unsparing treatment or severity. Also used for lavishness, extravagance of means and of life. So Thucydides: "The running aground of the ships was reckless (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c2;." iv. 26). Neglecting is wrong. Rev., correctly, severity. The &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; and before severity is doubtful. If omitted, severity to the body defines have a reputation for wisdom, the outward austerity being that which makes the popular impression of a higher wisdom.<p>In any honor (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#768;)<p>Rev., better, of any value. The real value of these ascetic practices contrasted with their popular estimation. Price or value is the original meaning of &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;, and its use in this sense is frequent in classical Greek. So in the New Testament, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-9.htm">Matthew 27:9</a>, "the price of Him who was priced (&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)." In Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-23.htm">1 Corinthians 7:23</a>. The idea of value appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>. "Ye were redeemed - with the precious (&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837;) blood of Christ;" something of real and adequate value. So <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-4.htm">1 Peter 2:4</a>, of Christ as the living stone, precious (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;), of recognized value.<p>To the satisfying (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>To means as a remedy against. &#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; denotes repletion, surfeiting. Paul says that these ascetic observances, while they appeal to men as indications of superior wisdom and piety, have no value as remedies against sensual indulgence. </body></html>
