(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-19.htm" title="I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe to me even your own self besides.">Philemon 1:19</a>, “I Paul have <span class= "ital">written it with mine own hand;</span> I will repay it.”) What this bond is we see by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>, which speaks of “the law of commandments in ordinances,” there called “the enmity slain by the cross.” On the meaning of “ordinances” see Note on that passage. The metaphor, however, here is different, and especially notable as the first anticipation of those many metaphors of later theology, from Tertullian downwards, in which the idea of a debt to God, paid for us by the blood of Christ, as “a satisfaction,” is brought out. The Law is a bond, “Do this and thou shalt live.” “The soul that sinneth it shall die.” On failure to do our part it “stands against us.” But God for Christ’s sake forgives our transgressions and cancels the bond. It is a striking metaphor, full of graphic expressiveness; it is misleading only when (as in some later theologies) we hold it to be not only the truth, but the whole truth, forgetting that legal and forensic metaphors can but imperfectly represent inner spiritual realities.<p><span class= "bld">And took it.</span>—Properly, <span class= "ital">and He</span> (Christ) <span class= "ital">hath taken it away.</span> The change of tense is significant. The act of atonement is over; its effect remains.<p><span class= "bld">Nailing it to his cross.</span>—At this point the idea of atonement comes in. Hitherto we have heard simply of free forgiveness and love of God. Now the bond is viewed, not as cancelled by a simple act of divine mercy, but as absolutely destroyed by Christ, by “nailing it to His cross.” It has been supposed (as by Bishop Pearson) that there is allusion to some custom of cancelling documents by the striking of a nail through them. But the custom is doubtful, and the supposition unnecessary. Our Lord “redeemed us from the curse of the Law,” by His death, “being made a curse for us” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>). St. Paul boldly speaks of that curse as a penalty standing against us, and as nailed to the cross with Himself, so to be for ever cancelled in the great declaration, “It is finished.” If any more definite allusion is to be sought for, we might be inclined to refer to the “title” on the cross, probably nailed to it. Such title declared the explanation of the sufferer’s death. The cancelled curse of the Law was just such an explanation of the great atoning death, and the title, declaring His mediatorial kingdom, showed the curse cancelled thereby.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/colossians/2.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Jeremiah<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">SIN’S WRITING AND ITS ERASURE<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm" title="The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven on the table of their heart, and on the horns of your altars;">Jeremiah 17:1</a></span>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the letter of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I have put these verses together because they all deal with substantially the same metaphor. The first is part of a prophet’s solemn appeal. It describes the sin of the nation as indelible. It is written in two places. First, on their hearts, which reminds us of the promise of the new covenant to be written on the heart. The ‘red-leaved tablets of the heart’ are like waxen tables on which an iron stylus makes a deep mark, an ineradicable scar. So Judah’s sin is, as it were, eaten into their heart, or, if we might so say, tattooed on it. It is also written on the stone horns of the altar, with a diamond which can cut the rock {an illustration of ancient knowledge of the properties of the diamond}. That sounds a strange place for the record of sin to appear, but the image has profound meaning, as we shall see presently.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then the two New Testament passages deal with other applications of the same metaphor. Christ is, in the first, represented as writing on the hearts of the Corinthians, and in the second, as taking away ‘the handwriting contrary to us.’ The general thought drawn from all is that sin’s writing on men’s hearts is erased by Christ and a new inscription substituted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The handwriting of sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Sin committed is indelibly written on the heart of the doer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘The heart,’ of course, in Hebrew means more than merely the supposed seat of the affections. It is figuratively the centre of the spiritual life, just as physically it is the centre of the natural. Thoughts and affections, purposes and desires are all included, and out of it are ‘the issues of life,’ the whole outgoings of the being. It is the fountain and source of all the activity of the man, the central unity from which all comes. Taken in this wide sense it is really the whole inner self that is meant, or, as is said in one place, ‘the hidden man of the heart.’ And so the thought in this vigorous metaphor may be otherwise put, that all sin makes indelible marks on the whole inward nature of the man who does it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now to begin with, think for a moment of that truth that everything which we do reacts on us the doers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We seldom think of this. Deeds are done, and we fancy that when done, they are done <span class="ital">with</span>. They pass, as far as outward seeming goes, and their distinguishable consequences in the outward world, in the vast majority of cases, soon apparently pass. All seems evanescent and irrecoverable as last year’s snows, or the water that flowed over the cataract a century ago. But there is nothing more certain than that all which we do leaves indelible traces on ourselves. The mightiest effect of a man’s actions is on his own inward life. The recoil of the gun is more powerful than the blow from its shot. Our actions strike inwards and there produce their most important effects. The river runs ceaselessly and its waters pass away, but they bring down soil, which is deposited and makes firm land, or perhaps they carry down grains of gold.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This is the true solemnity of life, that in all which we do we are carrying on a double process, influencing others indeed, but influencing ourselves far more.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Consider the illustrations of this law in regard to our sins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now the last thing people think of when they hear sermons about ‘sin’ is that what is meant is the things that they are doing every day. I can only ask you to try to remember, while I speak, that I mean those little acts of temper, or triflings with truth, or yieldings to passion or anger, or indulgence in sensuality, and above all, the living without God, to which we are all prone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{a} All wrong-doing makes indelible marks on character. It makes its own repetition easier. Habit strengthens inclination. Peter found denying his Lord three times easier than doing it once. It weakens resistance. In going downhill the first step is the only one that needs an effort; gravity will do the rest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It drags after it a tendency to other evil. All wrong things have so much in common that they lead on to one another. A man with only one vice is a rare phenomenon. Satan sends his apostles forth two by two. Sins hunt in couples, or more usually in packs, like wolves, only now and then do they prey alone like lions. Small thieves open windows for greater ones. It requires continually increasing draughts, like indulgence in stimulants. The palate demands cayenne tomorrow, if it has had black pepper to-day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So, whatever else we do by our acts, we are making our own characters, either steadily depraving or steadily improving them. There will come a slight slow change, almost unnoticed but most certain, as a dim film will creep over the peach, robbing it of all its bloom, or some microscopic growth will steal across a clearly cut inscription, or a breath of mist will dim a polished steel mirror.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{b} All wrong-doing writes indelible records on the memory, that awful and mysterious power of recalling past things out of the oblivion in which they seem to lie. How solemn and miserable it is to defile it with the pictures of things evil! Many a man in his later years has tried to ‘turn over a new leaf,’ and has never been able to get the filth out of his memory, for it has been printed on the old page in such strong colours that it shines through. I beseech you all, and especially you young people, to keep yourselves ‘innocent of much transgression,’ and ‘simple concerning evil’-to make your memories like an illuminated missal with fair saints and calm angels bordering the holy words, and not an <span class="ital">Illustrated</span> Police News. Probably there is no real oblivion. Each act sinks in as if forgotten, gets overlaid with a multitude of others, but it is there, and memory will one day bring it to us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And all sin pollutes the imagination. It is a miserable thing to have one’s mind full of ugly foul forms painted on the inner walls of our chamber of imagery, like the hideous figures in some heathen temple, where gods of lust and murder look out from every inch of space on the walls.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{c} All wrong-doing writes indelible records on the conscience. It does so partly by sophisticating it-the sensibility to right and wrong being weakened by every evil act, as a cold in the head takes away the sense of smell. It brings on colour-blindness to some extent. One does not know how far one may go towards ‘Evil! be thou my good’-or how far towards incapacity of distinguishing evil. But at all events the tendency of each sin is in that direction. So conscience may become seared, though perhaps never so completely as that there are no intervals when it speaks. It may long lie dormant, as Vesuvius did, till great trees grow on the floor of the crater, but all the while the communication with the central fires is open, and one day they will burst out.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The writing may be with invisible ink, but it will be legible one day. So, then, all this solemn writing on the heart is done by ourselves. What are you writing? There is a presumption in it of a future retribution, when you will have to read your autobiography, with clearer light and power of judging yourselves. At any rate there is retribution now, which is described by many metaphors, such as sowing and reaping, drinking as we have brewed, and others-but this one of indelible writing is not the least striking.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Sin is graven deep on sinful men’s worship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The metaphor here is striking and not altogether clear. The question rises whether the altars are idolatrous altars, or Jehovah’s. If the former, the expression may mean simply that the Jews’ idolatry, which was their sin, was conspicuously displayed in these altars, and had, as it were, its most flagrant record in their sacrifices. The altar was the centre point of all heathen and Old Testament worship, and altars built by sinners were the most conspicuous evidences of their sins.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So the meaning would be that men’s sin shapes and culminates in their religion; and that is very true, and explains many of the profanations and abominations of heathenism, and much of the formal worship of so-called Christianity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> For instance, a popular religion which is a mere Deism, a kind of vague belief in a providence, and in a future state where everybody is happy, is but the product of men’s sin, striking out of Christianity all which their sin makes unwelcome in it. The justice of God, punishment, sinfulness of sin, high moral tone, are all gone. And the very horns of their altars are marked with the signs of the worshippers’ sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But the ‘altars’ may be God’s altars, and then another idea will come in. The horns of the altar were the places where the blood of the sacrifice was smeared, as token of its offering to God. They were then a part of the ritual of propitiation. They had, no doubt, the same meaning in the heathen ritual. And so regarded, the metaphor means that a sense of the reality of sin shapes sacrificial religion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There can be no doubt that a very real conviction of sin lies at the foundation of much, if not all, of the system of sacrifices. And it is a question well worth considering whether a conviction so widespread is not valid, and whether we should not see in it the expression of a true human need which no mere culture, or the like, will supply.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> At all events, altars stand as witnesses to the consciousness of sin. And the same thought may be applied to much of the popular religion of this day. It may be ineffectual and shallow but it bears witness to a consciousness of evil. So its existence may be used in order to urge profounder realisation of evil on men. You come to worship, you join in confessions, you say ‘miserable sinners’-do you mean anything by it? If all that be true, should it not produce a deeper impression on you?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But another way of regarding the metaphor is this. The horns of the altar were to be touched with the blood of propitiation. But look! the blood flows down, and after it has trickled away, there, deep carven on the horns, still appears the sin, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the sin is not expiated by the sinner’s sacrifice. Jeremiah is then echoing Isaiah’s word, ‘Bring no more vain oblations.’ The picture gives very strikingly the hopelessness, so far as men are concerned, of any attempt to blot out this record. It is like the rock-cut cartouches of Egypt on which time seems to have no effect. There they abide deep for ever. Nothing that we can do can efface them. ‘What I have written, I have written.’ Pen-knives and detergents that we can use are all in vain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Sin’s writing may be erased, and another put in its place.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The work of Christ, made ours by faith, blots it out.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{a} Its influence on conscience and the sense of guilt. The accusations of conscience are silenced. A red line is drawn across the indictment, or, as Colossians has it, it is ‘nailed to the cross.’ There is power in His death to set us free from the debt we owe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{b} Its influence on memory. Christ does not bring oblivion, but yet takes away the remorse of remembrance. Faith in Christ makes memory no longer a record which we blush to turn over, or upon which we gloat with imaginative delight in guilty pleasures past, but a record of our shortcomings that humbles us with a penitence which is not pain, but serves as a beacon and warning for the time to come. He who has a clear beam of memory on his backward track, and a bright light of hope on his forward one, will steer right.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>{c} Its influence on character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We attain new hopes and tastes. ‘We become epistles of Christ known and read of all men,’ like palimpsests, Homer or Ovid written over with the New Testament gospels or epistles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Christ’s work is twofold, erasure and rewriting. For the one, ‘I will blot out as a cloud their transgressions.’ None but He can remove these. For the other, ‘I will put My law into their minds and will write it on their hearts.’ He can impress all holy desires on, and can put His great love and His mighty spirit into, our hearts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So give your hearts to Him. They are all scrawled over with hideous and wicked writing that has sunk deep into their substance. Graven as if on rock are your sins in your character. Your worship and sacrifices will not remove them, but Jesus Christ can. He died that you might be forgiven, He lives that you may be purified. Trust yourself to Him, and lean all your sinfulness on His atonement and sanctifying power, and the foul words and bad thoughts that have been scored so deep into your nature will be erased, and His own hand will trace on the page, poor and thin though it be, which has been whitened by His blood, the fair letters and shapes of His own likeness. Do not let your hearts be the devil’s copybooks for all evil things to scrawl their names there, as boys do on the walls, but spread them before Him, and ask Him to make them clean and write upon them His new name, indicating that you now belong to another, as a new owner writes his name on a book that he has bought.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-17 There is a philosophy which rightly exercises our reasonable faculties; a study of the works of God, which leads us to the knowledge of God, and confirms our faith in him. But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blotting out the handwriting - The word rendered handwriting means something written by the hand, a manuscript; and here, probably, the writings of the Mosaic law, or the law appointing many ordinances or observances in religion. The allusion is probably to a written contract, in which we bind ourselves to do any work, or to make a payment, and which remains in force against us until the bond is cancelled. That might be done, either by blotting out the names, or by drawing lines through it, or, as appears to have been practiced in the East, by driving a nail through it. The Jewish ceremonial law is here represented as such a contract, binding those under it to its observance, until it was nailed to the cross. The meaning here is, that the burdensome requirements of the Mosaic law are abolished, and that its necessity is superseded by the death of Christ. His death had the same effect, in reference to those ordinances, as if they had been blotted from the statute-book. This it did by fulfilling them, by introducing a more perfect system, and by rendering their observance no longer necessary, since all that they were designed to typify had been now accomplished in a better way; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a>.<p>Of ordinances - Prescribing the numerous rites and ceremonies of the Jewish religion.<p>That was against us - That is, against our peace, happiness, comfort; or in other words, which was oppressive and burdensome; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>. Those ordinances bound and lettered the soul, restrained the expansive spirit of true piety which seeks the salvation of all alike, and thus operated as a hindrance to the enlarged spirit of true religion. Thus, they really operated against the truly pious Jew, whose religion would lead him to seek the salvation of the world; and to the Gentile, since he was not in a situation to avail himself of them, and since they would be burdensome if he could. It is in this sense, probably, that the apostle uses the word "us," as referring to all, and as cramping and restraining the true nature of religion.<p>Which was contrary to us - Operated as a hindrance, or obstruction, in the matter of religion. The ordinances of the Mosaic law were necessary, in order to introduce the gospel; but they were always burdensome. They were to be confined to one people; and, if they were continued, they would operate to prevent the spread of the true religion around the world; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>, note, 9, note. Hence, the exulting language of the apostle in view of the fact that they were now taken away, and that the benefits of religion might be diffused all over the world. The gospel contains nothing which is "against," or "contrary to," the true interest and happiness of any nation or any class of people.<p>And took it out of the way - Greek, "Out of the midst;" that is, he wholly removed it. He has removed the obstruction, so that it no longer prevents union and harmony between the Jews and the Gentiles.<p>Nailing it to his cross - As if he had nailed it to his cross, so that it would be entirely removed out of our way. The death of Jesus had the same effect, in regard to the rites and institutions of the Mosaic religion, as if they had been affixed to his cross. It is said that there is an allusion here to the ancient method by which a bond or obligation was cancelled, by driving a nail through it, and affixing it to a post. This was practiced, says Grotius, in Asia. In a somewhat similar manner, in our banks now, a sharp instrument like the blade of a knife is driven through a check, making a hole through it, and furnishing to the teller of the bank a sign or evidence that it has been paid. If this be the meaning, then the expression here denotes that the obligation of the Jewish institutions ceased on the death of Jesus, as if he had taken them and nailed them to his own cross, in the manner in which a bond was cancelled. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. Blotting out&#8212;Greek, "Having wiped out"; coincident in time with "having forgiven you" (Col 2:13); hereby having cancelled the law's indictment against you. The law (including especially the moral law, wherein lay the chief difficulty in obeying) is abrogated to the believer, as far as it was a compulsory, accusing code, and as far as "righteousness" (justification) and "life" were sought for by it. It can only produce outward works, not inward obedience of the will, which in the believer flows from the Holy Spirit in Him (Ro 3:21; 7:2, 4; Ga 2:19).<p>the handwriting of ordinances&#8212;rather, "IN ordinances" (see on [2416]Eph 2:15); "the law of commandments contained in ordinances." "The handwriting" (alluding to the Decalogue, the representative of the law, written by the hand of God) is the whole law, the obligatory bond, under which all lay; the Jews primarily were under the bond, but they in this respect were the representative people of the world (Ro 3:19); and in their inability to keep the law was involved the inability of the Gentiles also, in whose hearts "the work of the law was written" (Ro 2:15); and as they did not keep this, they were condemned by it.<p>that was against us &#8230; contrary to us&#8212;Greek "adversary to us"; so it is translated, Heb 10:27. "Not only was the law against us by its demands, but also an adversary to us by its accusations" [Bengel]. Tittmann explains the Greek, "having a latent contrariety to us"; not open designed hostility, but virtual unintentional opposition through our frailty; not through any opposition in the law itself to our good (Ro 7:7-12, 14; 1Co 15:56; Ga 3:21; Heb 10:3). The "WRITING" is part of "that which was contrary to us"; for "the letter killeth" (see on [2417]2Co 3:6).<p>and took it&#8212;Greek, and hath taken it out of the way" (so as to be no longer a hindrance to us), by "nailing it to the cross." Christ, by bearing the curse of the broken law, has redeemed us from its curse (Ga 3:13). In His person nailed to the cross, the law itself was nailed to it. One ancient mode of cancelling bonds was by striking a nail through the writing: this seems at that time to have existed in Asia [Grotius]. The bond cancelled in the present case was the obligation lying against the Jews as representatives of the world, and attested by their amen, to keep the whole law under penalty of the curse (De 27:26; Ne 10:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us:</span> having just before manifested God’s grace in the free forgiveness of all their trespasses, he doth here adjoin the foundation and means of this remission, viz.

What is thus characterized is not the <span class="ital">burden of debt</span> lying upon man, which is, as it were, his debt-schedule (Bleek), but the <span class="ital">Mosaic law</span>. A <span class="greekheb">χειρόγραφον</span>, namely, is an obligatory document of debt (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/5-3.htm" title="Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money.">Tob 5:3</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/9-5.htm" title="So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him the handwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, and gave them to him.">Tob 9:5</a>; Polyb. 30:8. 4; Dion.

And the <span class="ital">law</span> is the <span class="greekheb">χειρόγραφον</span> confronting us, <span class="ital">in so far</span> as men are bound to fulfil it perfectly, in order to avoid the threatened penal curse; and consequently because no one renders this fulfilment, it, like a bill of debt, proves them <span class="ital">debtors</span> (the creditor is God). We are not to carry the figure further, in which case we should come to the halting point in the comparison, that the <span class="ital">man</span> who is bound has not <span class="ital">himself written</span> the <span class="greekheb">χειρόγραφον</span>.[106] Hofmann maintains that this element also, namely, man’s <span class="ital">having written it with his own hand</span>, is retained in the conception of the figurative <span class="greekheb">χειρόγραφον</span>. But the apostle himself precludes this view by his having written, not: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ἩΜῶΝ ΧΕΙΡΌΓΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> (which would mean: <span class="ital">the document of debt drawn by us</span>), but: <span class="greekheb">τὸ καθʼ ἡμῶν χειρόγρ</span>.; which purposely chosen expression does not affirm that we have <span class="ital">ourselves written</span> the document, but it does affirm that it <span class="ital">authenticates</span> us <span class="ital">as arrested for debt</span>, and is consequently <span class="ital">against</span> us. The words <span class="greekheb">τοῖς δόγμασιν</span> appended (see below) also preclude the conception of the debt-record being written by man’s own hand. Moreover, the law is to be understood as an integral <span class="ital">whole</span>, and the various limitations of it, either to the <span class="ital">ceremonial law</span> (Calvin, Beza, Schoettgen, and others), or to the <span class="ital">moral law</span> (Calovius), are altogether in opposition to the connection (see above, <span class="greekheb">πάντα τὰ παραπτ</span>.), and un-Pauline. The explanation referring it to the <span class="ital">conscience</span> (Luther, Zwingli, Melanchthon, and others) is also at variance both with the word and with the context.[107] The conscience is the medium for the <span class="ital">knowledge</span> of the law <span class="ital">as</span> the handwriting which testifies against us; without the activity of the conscience, this relation, in which the law stands to us, would remain unknown. Exception has been taken to its being explained of the Mosaic law on account of the use of <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span>, seeing that this law existed only for the <span class="ital">Jews</span>. But without due ground; for it is in fact also the schedule of debt against the <span class="ital">Gentiles</span>, in so far, namely, as the latter have the knowledge of the <span class="greekheb">δικαίωμα τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-32.htm" title="Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.">Romans 1:32</a>), have in fact <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ἚΡΓΟΝ ΤΟῦ ΝΌΜΟΥ ΓΡΑΠΤῸΝ ἘΝ ΤΑῖς ΚΑΡΔΊΑΙς ΑὐΤῶΝ</span></span></span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a>), and, consequently, fall likewise under the condemning sentence of the law, though not directly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-19.htm" title="Now we know that what things soever the law said, it said to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.">Romans 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm" title="For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;">Romans 2:12</a>), but indirectly, because they, having incurred through their own fault a darkening of their minds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/1-20.htm" title="For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:...">Romans 1:20-23</a>), transgress the “<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΟΙΝῸΝ ἉΠΆΝΤΩΝ ἈΝΘΡΏΠΩΝ ΝΌΜΟΝ</span></span></span>” (Dem. 639. 22).

Thus the tenor of the <span class="ital">contents</span> of what is written is indicated by the dative of the instrument (<span class="ital">ablativus modi</span>), just as the <span class="ital">external</span> constituent elements of writing, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <span class="greekheb">γράμμασι</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-11.htm" title="You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.">Galatians 6:11</a>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΎΠΟΙς</span></span></span> in Plat. <span class="ital">Ep</span>. 7, p. 343 A, are expressed by the same dative.

Plat. <span class="ital">l.c.:</span> <span class="greekheb">τὰ γεγραμμένα τύποις</span>). This direct combination of a verbal substantive with a dative of the instrument is such an unquestionable and current phenomenon in classical Greek (see Matthiae, II. p. 890; Heindorf, <span class="ital">ad Plat. Cratyl</span>. p. 131; and especially Kühner, II. 1, p. 374), that the connection in question cannot in the least degree appear as harsh (Winer, Buttmann), or even as unnatural (Hofmann); nor should it have been regarded as something “<span class="ital">welded on</span>” by the interpolator (Holtzmann, p. 74), who had desired thereby to give to <span class="greekheb">χειρόγρ</span>. its reference to the law. The explanation given by many writers (Calvin, Beza, Vitringa, Wolf, Michaelis, Heinrichs, and others, comp. Luther), which hits nearly the true sense: the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΕΙΡΌΓΡΑΦΟΝ</span></span></span>, consisting in the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΓΜΑΣΙ</span></span></span>, is to be corrected grammatically in accordance with what we have said above.

So also Winer, p. 206 [E. T. 275]. This, however, would have been expressed by <span class="greekheb">τὸ τοῖς δόγμασι καθʼ ἡμῶν χειρόγρ</span>., or in some other way corresponding grammatically with the sense assumed. Ewald joins <span class="greekheb">τοῖς δόγμ</span>. as <span class="ital">appropriating</span> dative (see Bernhardy, p. 88 f.) to <span class="greekheb">χειρόγρ</span>.: our <span class="ital">bond of obligation to the statutes</span>.[109] But if <span class="greekheb">χειρόγρ</span>. were <span class="ital">our</span> bond of obligation (subjectively), the expression <span class="greekheb">τὸ καθʼ ἡμῶν χειρ</span>. would be inappropriate, and Paul would have said merely <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἡμῶν χειρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόγμ</span>. It is incorrect as to sense, though not linguistically erroneous, to connect <span class="greekheb">τοῖς δόγμ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">ἐξαλείψας</span>, in which case it is explained to mean (as by Harless on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>) that the abrogation of the law had taken place either <span class="ital">as regards its statutes</span> (Steiger); or <span class="ital">by the evangelical doctrines of faith</span> (the Greek expositors, Estius, Grotius, Hammond, Bengel, and others); or <span class="ital">nova praecepta stabiliendo</span> (Fritzsche, <span class="ital">Diss. in</span> 2 <span class="ital">Cor</span>.

Since the law which condemned man lost its punitive force through the death of Christ on the cross, inasmuch as Christ through this death suffered the curse of the law for men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm" title="Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree:">Galatians 3:13</a>), and became the end of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>), at the same time that <span class="ital">Christ</span> was nailed as <span class="greekheb">ἱλαστήριον</span> to the cross, the law was nailed to it also, and thus it ceased to be <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΜΈΣῼ</span></span></span>. Observe, moreover, the logical relation of the <span class="ital">aorist</span> participle to the <span class="ital">perfect</span> <span class="greekheb">ἦρκεν</span>. The latter is the state of the matter, which has emerged and exists <span class="ital">after God has nailed</span>, etc. The <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸ ἦρκεν ἐκ μέσου</span> takes place <span class="ital">since</span> that nailing. In the strong expression <span class="greekheb">προσηλώσας</span>, purposely chosen and placed foremost, there is involved an <span class="ital">antinomistic triumph</span>, which makes the disarming of the law very palpably apparent. Chrysostom has aptly observed on the whole passage: <span class="greekheb">οὐδαμοῦ οὕτως μεγαλοφώνως ἐφθέγξατο</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁρᾷς σπουδὴν τοῦ ἀφανισθῆναι τὸ χειρόγραφον ὅσην ἐποιήσατο</span>; <span class="greekheb">οἷον πάντες ἦμεν ὑφʼ ἁμαρτίαν κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κόλασιν</span>· <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς κολασθεὶς ἔλυσε καὶ τὴν ἁμαρτίαν καὶ τὴν κόλασιν</span>. Nevertheless, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΡΟΣΗΛΏΣΑς</span></span></span> neither figuratively depicts the <span class="ital">tearing in pieces</span> of the <span class="greekheb">χειρόγρ</span>. (Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact), nor is there any allusion to an alleged custom of publicly placarding <span class="ital">antiquated</span> laws (Grotius). According to Hofmann (comp. also his <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 1, p. 370 f.), a public placarding <span class="ital">with a view to observance</span> is meant; the requirement of Israelitish <span class="ital">legal</span> <span class="ital">obligation</span> has become <span class="ital">changed</span> into the requirement of <span class="ital">faith</span> in the Crucified One which may be read on the <span class="ital">cross</span>, and this transformation is also the <span class="ital">pardon</span> of transgressions of the law. This is a fanciful pushing further of the apostolic figure, the point of which is merely the blotting out and taking away of the law, as the debt-document hostile to us, by the death of the cross. The entire representation which is presented in this sensuous concrete form, and which is not to be expanded into the fanciful figure of transformation which we have just referred to, is intended, in fact, to illustrate merely the <span class="ital">forgiveness of sins</span> introduced by <span class="greekheb">χαρισάμενος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>, and nothing more.

It is to be observed, at the same time, that the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΞΑΛΕΊΦΕΙΝ</span></span></span> and the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΑἼΡΕΙΝ ἘΚ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΜΈΣΟΥ</span></span></span> do not represent two acts substantially different, but the <span class="ital">same</span> thing, the perfect accomplishment of which is <span class="ital">explained</span> by way of climax with particularising vividness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[106] The relation of <span class="ital">obligation</span> and <span class="ital">indebtedness</span> in which man stands to the law (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm" title="For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.">Galatians 3:10</a>) is quite sufficient to justify the conception of the latter as the <span class="greekheb">χειρόγραφον</span>, without seeking this specially in the <span class="ital">promise of the people,</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm" title="And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD has said will we do.">Exodus 24:3</a> (Chrysostom, (Oecumenius, Theophylact, and others; also Hofmann); which the reader could not guess without some more precise indication. Indeed, that promise of the people in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm" title="And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD has said will we do.">Exodus 24:3</a> has by no means the mark of being <span class="ital">self-written,</span> but contains only the self-<span class="ital">obligation,</span> and would not, therefore, any more than the <span class="ital">amen</span> in Deuteronomy 27 (which Castalio suggests), suffice for the idea of the <span class="greekheb">χειρόγραφον</span>, if the latter had to contain the debtor’s <span class="ital">own handwriting.</span> In accordance with the apostle’s words (<span class="greekheb">τὸ καθʼ ἡμῶν χειρόγρ</span>., see above), and with the type of his doctrine regarding the impossibility of legal righteousness, his readers could think only of the <span class="greekheb">γράμμα</span> of <span class="ital">the law itself</span> as that which proves man a debtor; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-27.htm" title="And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge you, who by the letter and circumcision do transgress the law?">Romans 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-6.htm" title="But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.">Romans 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-6.htm" title="Who also has made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter kills, but the spirit gives life.">2 Corinthians 3:6</a>.

He considers as the <span class="greekheb">χειρόγραφον</span> not the Mosaic law itself, but the bill of debt which the <span class="ital">broken law</span> has <span class="ital">drawn up</span> against us. The very parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>. Partially parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>. Apparently Paul now passes to the historic fact which supplied the ground for the forgiveness. <span class="greekheb">χαρισ</span>. therefore refers to the subjective appropriation of the objective blotting out of the bond in the death of Christ.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξαλείψας</span>: “having blotted out,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, having cancelled.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ καθʼ ἡμῶν χειρόγραφον τοῖς δόγμασιν</span>. The original sense of <span class="greekheb">χειρόγ</span>. is handwriting, but it had come to mean a bond or note of hand. It is generally agreed that the reference here is to the Law (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὸν νόμον τῶν ἐντολῶν ἐν δόγμασιν</span>). That those under the Law did not write the Law has been pressed against this. It is true that <span class="greekheb">χειρόγ</span>. means strictly a bond given by the debtor in writing. It is not necessary, with Chrysostom and many others, to meet the objection by reference to the promise of the people in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm" title="And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD has said will we do.">Exodus 24:3</a>. There is no need to press rigidly this detail of the metaphor. It is disputed in what sense we are to take the reference to the Law. Some (including Lightf., Ol., Sod., Abb.) think it embraces the Mosaic Law and the law written in the hearts of Gentiles. It is quite possible, however, that <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἡμῶν</span> means simply against us Jews. But, apart from this, the addition of <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δογ</span>. points to formulated commandment. This is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm" title="Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;">Ephesians 2:15</a>, where the similar expression is used, not of what Jews and Gentiles had in common, but that which created the separation between them, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the Jewish Law. Whether, with Calvin, Klöpper and Haupt, we should still further narrow the reference to the ceremonial Law is very questionable. It is true that circumcision and laws of meat and drink and sacred seasons are the chief forms that the “bond” takes. And it might make the interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a> a little easier to regard the ceremonial as that part of the Law specially given by angels. But this distinction between the moral and ceremonial Law has no meaning in Paul. The Law is a unity and is done away as a whole. And for Paul the hostile character of the Law is peculiarly associated with the moral side of it. The law which slew him is illustrated by the tenth commandment, and the ministry of death was engraved on tablets of stone. It was the moral elements in the Law that made it the strength of sin. It is not certain how <span class="greekheb">τοῖς δόγμασιν</span> should be taken. Frequently it is interpreted “consisting in decrees”. For this we ought to have had <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἐν δόγ</span>. Ellicott says this construction “seems distinctly ungrammatical”. Others (including Mey., Lightf., Sod., Haupt, Abb.) connect closely with <span class="greekheb">χειρόγ</span>., in such a way that the dative is governed by <span class="greekheb">γεγραμμένον</span> implied in <span class="greekheb">χειρόγ</span>. This is questionable in point of grammar. Winer says: “Meyer’s explanation, <span class="ital">that which was written with the commandments</span> (the dative being used as in the phrase <span class="ital">written with letters</span>), is the more harsh, as <span class="greekheb">χειρόγραφον</span> has so completely established itself in usage as an independent word that it is hardly capable of governing (like <span class="greekheb">γεγραμμένον</span>) such a dative as this”. (Winer-Moulton, p. 275; <span class="ital">cf.</span> also Ellicott <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>) It seems best then (with De W., Ell., Kl[15], Ol.) to translate “the handwriting which was against us by its ordinances”. For this we should have expected <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χειρόγ</span>. or <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῖς δόγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χειρόγ</span>; but this seems to be the best way of taking the text as it stands, and perhaps the position of <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόγ</span>. is for emphasis. The Greek commentators, followed by Bengel, explained the passage to mean having blotted out the Law by the doctrines of the Gospel. But <span class="greekheb">δόγ</span>. is a most un-Pauline, because legalist, expression for the Gospel, and by itself could not mean Christian doctrines. Nor is the sense it gives Pauline, for it was not by the teaching of the Gospel, but by the death of Christ, that the Law was done away. Erasmus’ view (followed by Hofm.) that <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόγ</span>. should be connected with what follows is very improbable.—<span class="greekheb">ὃ ἦν ὑπεναντίον ἡμῖν</span>: stronger than <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἡμῶν</span>, asserting not merely that the bond had a claim against us, but that it was hostile to us, the suggestion being that we could not meet its claim. No idea of secret hostility is present.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτὸ ἦρκεν ἐκ τοῦ μέσου</span>. “And it He hath taken out of the midst.” The change from aorist to perfect is significant, as expressing the abiding character of the abolition. Lightfoot thinks that a change of subject takes place here, from God to Christ. His reason is that Christ must be the subject of <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδ</span>., since “no grammatical meaning can be assigned to <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδυσάμενος</span>, by which it could be understood of God the Father”. Since, however, no change of subject is hinted at in the passage, and would involve great difficulty, it is more reasonable to conclude that an interpretation which requires Christ to be the subject of <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδ</span>. is self-condemned.—<span class="greekheb">προσηλώσας αὐτὸ τῷ σταυρῷ</span>: “having nailed it to the cross”. When Christ was crucified, God nailed the Law to His cross. Thus it, like the flesh, was abrogated, sharing His death. The bond therefore no longer exists for us. To explain the words by reference to a custom of driving a nail through documents to cancel them, is not only to call in a questionable fact (see Field, <span class="ital">Notes on Transl. of the N.T.</span>, p. 196), but to dilute in the most tasteless way one of Paul’s most striking and suggestive phrases. Quite on a level with it is Field’s own suggestion as to “this seemingly superfluous addition” (!) that the reference is to the custom of hanging up spoils of war in temples. Zahn (<span class="ital">Einl. in das N.T.</span>, i., 335) draws a distinction between what was written on the bond and was blotted out by God, and the bond itself which was nailed to the cross and taken out of the way. We thus have two thoughts expressed: the removal of guilt incurred by transgression of the Law, and the abolition of the Law itself. It is questionable if this distinction is justified.

The original word, <span class="ital">cheirographon</span>, meaning an autograph, is used often in this sense, and oftener (transliterated) in Latin than in Greek. So here the Latin Versions have <span class="ital">chirographum decreti</span>.—What is “<span class="ital">the bond</span>”? The question is best answered under the next words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of ordinances</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">with relation to ordinances</span>”<span class="ital">;</span> based on them, conditioned by them. “<span class="ital">The bond written in ordinances</span>”<span class="ital">;</span> R. V.—These “ordinances” (<span class="ital">dogmata</span>) are not <span class="ital">rites</span> but, as the Greek word always means in the N.T., <span class="ital">orders, decrees</span>. The reference cannot be solely to the “decrees” of the <span class="ital">Jewish Law</span>, for here the case of <span class="ital">all</span> believing sinners is in view. The decrees are rather that of which that Law was only one grand instance, the Divine precept of holiness, however conveyed, whether by revelation or by conscience (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-12.htm" title="For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;...">Romans 2:12-15</a>). Man’s assent, however imperfect, to the lightness of that precept, is as it were his signature of obligation to “the bond”; a bond which his sin has made to be a terribly <span class="ital">adverse</span> engagement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lightfoot points out that the Greek commentators “universally” interpret the words rendered “of ordinances” quite differently; “<span class="ital">by the dogmata</span>, or <span class="ital">doctrines</span> (<span class="ital">of the Gospel</span>)”; the Gospel being the means of the abrogation of the Law. But this, as he shews, is (<span class="ital">a</span>) alien to the context, (<span class="ital">b</span>) out of harmony with an important parallel word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-20.htm" title=" Why if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances,">Colossians 2:20</a> below (see notes on that verse), (<span class="ital">c</span>) not supported by the usage (elsewhere in N.T.) of the Greek word <span class="ital">dogma</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">contrary</span>] <span class="bld">directly opposed</span> (Lightfoot). The Greek is a single compound word, giving by its form the thought of a close and grappling opposition.

He there discharged our bond, and thus cancelled it, tore it up as it were; and the tearing up is vividly described as the piercing of it with the nails which had affixed Him, our Satisfaction, to the Cross.—There seems to be no evidence for the existence of any legal custom, such as the nailing up an abrogated decree in public, which could have suggested this language.

In the New Testament (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-4.htm">Acts 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-23.htm">Hebrews 11:23</a>), as in classical Greek, <span class="accented">dogma</span> is <span class="accented">a decree</span>, setting forth the will of some public authority (comp. note on <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, ver. 20). The added clause, "which was opposed to us," affirms the active opposition, as "against us" the essential hostility of the decrees of God's law to our sinful nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13, 14</a>).

A third time in these three verses (12-14) we note the transition from participle to coordinate finite verb; and here, in addition, the aorist tense passes into the perfect ("hath taken"), marking the finality of the removal of the Law's condemning power (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39</a>): comp. the opposite transition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>. The <span class="accented">moral deliverance</span> of ver. 11 is traced up to this <span class="accented">legal release</span>, both contained in our completeness in Christ (ver. 10). The subject is still "God." <span class="accented">Cancelling the bond</span> which he held against us in his Law, God has forver <span class="accented">removed the barrier</span> which stood between mankind and himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>). <span class="accented">Christ's</span> place in this work, already shown in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18-23</a> (in its relation to <span class="accented">himself</span>), is vividly recalled by the mention of <span class="accented">the cross.</span> And the abolition of the Law's condemnation is finally set forth by a yet bolder metaphor - <span class="accented">"having nailed</span> it to the cross." The nails of the cross in piercing Christ pierced the legal instrument which held us debtors, and nullified it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4-6</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> may suggest the further idea of <span class="accented">nailing up</span> the cancelled document, by way of publication.

Lit., in ordinances; consisting in, or, as Rev., written in, as suggested by handwriting. As Paul declares this bond to be against us, including both Jews and Gentiles, the reference, while primarily to the Mosaic law, is to be taken in a wider sense, as including the moral law of God in general, which applied to the Gentiles as much as to the Jews. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-19.htm">Romans 3:19</a>. The law is frequently conceived by Paul with this wider reference, as a principle which has its chief representative in the Mosaic law, but the applications of which are much wider. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>. This law is conceived here as a bond, a bill of debt, standing against those who have not received Christ. As the form of error at Colossae was largely Judaic, insisting on the Jewish ceremonial law, the phrase is probably colored by this fact. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15</a>.<p>Which was contrary to us (&#x3bf;&#788;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>He has just said which was against us (&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;' &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;); which stood to our debit, binding us legally. This phrase enlarges on that idea, emphasizing the hostile character of the bond, as a hindrance. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-56.htm">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23</a>. "Law is against us, because it comes like a taskmaster, bidding us do, but neither putting the inclination into our hearts nor the power into our hands. And law is against us, because the revelation of unfulfilled duty is the accusation of the defaulter, and a revelation to him of his guilt. And law is against us, because it comes with threatenings and foretastes of penalty and pain. Thus, as standard, accuser, and avenger it is against us" (Maclaren).<p>Took it out of the way (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;)<p>Lit., out of the midst.<p>Nailing it to His cross (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;)<p>Rev., the cross. The verb occurs nowhere else. The law with its decrees was abolished in Christ's death, as if crucified with Him. It was no longer in the midst, in the foreground, as a debtor's obligation is perpetually before him, embarrassing his whole life. Ignatius: "I perceived that ye were settled in unmovable faith, as if nailed (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;) upon the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in flesh and spirit" (To Smyrna, 1). </body></html>
