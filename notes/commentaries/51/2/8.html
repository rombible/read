Now, (1) <span class= "ital">the character of that error in itself</span> is described with apparently intentional vagueness, as “a philosophy of vain deceit,” “after tradition of men,” after “the rudiments of this world.” Even its Judaic origin, which is made clear below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16-17</a>), is here only hinted at in the significant allusion to Circumcision, and perhaps in the phrase “the rudiments of the world,” which is also used of the Judaism of Galatia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>). (2) What is brought out vividly and emphatically is <span class= "ital">the truth which it contradicts or obscures.</span> First, the full indwelling Godhead of Christ and His headship over all created being; and next, as derived from this, our own “spiritual circumcision in Him, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the true “death unto sin and new life unto righteousness” in Him who is the One Atonement for all sin, and the One Conqueror of all the powers of evil. On the relation of the Epistle to Gnosticism see <span class= "ital">Excursus A.</span><p>(8) <span class= "bld">Spoil you.</span>—Properly, <span class= "ital">lead you away as a spoil, </span>triumph over you as a captive, and make you a slave. Comp. St. Paul’s language as to the older Judaism at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="For you suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.">2Corinthians 11:20</a>), “Ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.”<p><span class= "bld">Philosophy and vain deceit</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.</span> (like “the knowledge falsely so called” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm" title="O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:">1Timothy 6:20</a>), a philosophy which is inseparably connected with vain deceit. The warning implied here seems to be two-fold:—(1) First, against considering Christianity primarily as a “philosophy,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a search for and knowledge of speculative truth, even the highest. That it involves philosophy is obvious, for it claims to solve for us the great problem of Being, in Nature, in Man, and in God. St. Paul, while he depreciates the wisdom of this world, dwells emphatically on the gospel as the “wisdom of God.” (See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6-16</a>.) In this Epistle in particular he speaks of “wisdom” again and again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm" title=" In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.">Colossians 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-16.htm" title=" Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.">Colossians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-6.htm" title=" Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.">Colossians 4:6</a>) as one great characteristic of Christian life. Nor is it less clear (as the ancient Greek commentators here earnestly remind us) that Christianity finds a place and a blessing for all true philosophy of men, and makes it, as St. Paul made it at Athens, an introduction to the higher wisdom. But Christianity is not a philosophy, but a life—not a knowledge of abstract principles, but a personal knowledge of faith and love of God in Christ. (2) Next, against accepting in philosophy the “vain deceit” of mere speculation and imagination instead of the modest, laborious investigation of facts. This is the “knowledge falsely so called”; of this it may be said (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>) that it “puffs up,” and does not “build up.” In ancient and modern times it has always confused brilliant theory with solid discovery, delighting especially to dissolve the great facts of the gospel into abstractions, which may float in its cloudland of imagination.<p><span class= "bld">After the tradition of men.</span>—This is the keynote of our Lord’s condemnation of the old Pharisaic exclusiveness and formalism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-2.htm" title="Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.">Matthew 15:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-6.htm" title="And honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have you made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.">Matthew 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/7-8.htm" title="For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things you do.">Mark 7:8-9</a>); it is equally the condemnation of the later Jewish, or half-Jewish, mysticism which St. Paul attacks here. It is hardly necessary to remark that the Apostle often claims reverence for “traditions” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.">1Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Therefore, brothers, stand fast, and hold the traditions which you have been taught, whether by word, or our letter.">2Thessalonians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2Thessalonians 3:6</a>; see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1Corinthians 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-21.htm" title="For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.">2Peter 2:21</a>), but they are traditions having their starting point in direct revelation of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm" title="For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.">Galatians 1:12</a>), and, moreover, traditions freely given to all, as being His. The “traditions of men” here condemned had their origin in human speculation, and were secretly transmitted to the initiated only.<p><span class= "bld">The rudiments of the world.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-2.htm" title="But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.">Galatians 4:2</a>, and Note there. This marks the chief point of contact with the earlier Judaism, in the stress still laid, perhaps with less consistency, on matters of ritual, law, ascetic observance, and the like. These are “of the world,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>belonging to the visible sphere; and they are “rudiments,” fit only for the elementary education of those who are as children, and intended simply as preparation for a higher teaching.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/colossians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Beware lest any man spoil you </span>— <span class="greekheb">Μη τις υμας εσται ο συλαγωγων</span>, <span class="ital">lest there be any one who makes a prey of you; through philosophy </span>— The pretended wisdom of the heathen philosophers; <span class="ital">and vain deceit </span>— Sophistical and delusive reasonings, and unprofitable speculations. “The apostle,” as Macknight justly observes, “does not condemn sound philosophy, but that kind of it which had no foundation in truth; and, being formed merely from imagination, aided by the pride of human reason, was supported by tradition; that is, by the affirmation of the inventors, handed down from one to another. Of this kind was the philosophy of the Platonists concerning <span class="ital">demons, </span>whom they represented as carrying men’s prayers to God, and as bringing back from God the blessings prayed for. They spake of them likewise as governing the elements and all human affairs, by a sort of independent power.” It seems some teachers had crept in among the Christians at Colosse, either of Gentile or Jewish extraction, who endeavoured to blend deceits of this kind with the gospel of Christ, and that this is what the apostle here condemns; 1st, Because it was <span class="ital">empty </span>and <span class="ital">deceitful, </span>promising wisdom, but giving none. 2d, Because it was grounded, not on truth, or solid reason, but on the vain and false traditions of men. 3d, Because, as the apostle here says, it was after the <span class="ital">rudiments, </span><span class="greekheb">στοιχεια</span>, <span class="ital">the elements, of the world </span>— Such as the Jewish ceremonies, or the pagan superstitions.

But there is a philosophy which is vain and deceitful; and while it pleases men's fancies, hinders their faith: such are curious speculations about things above us, or no concern to us. Those who walk in the way of the world, are turned from following Christ. We have in Him the substance of all the shadows of the ceremonial law. All the defects of it are made up in the gospel of Christ, by his complete sacrifice for sin, and by the revelation of the will of God. To be complete, is to be furnished with all things necessary for salvation. By this one word complete, is shown that we have in Christ whatever is required. In him, not when we look to Christ, as though he were distant from us, but we are in him, when, by the power of the Spirit, we have faith wrought in our hearts by the Spirit, and we are united to our Head. The circumcision of the heart, the crucifixion of the flesh, the death and burial to sin and to the world, and the resurrection to newness of life, set forth in baptism, and by faith wrought in our hearts, prove that our sins are forgiven, and that we are fully delivered from the curse of the law. Through Christ, we, who were dead in sins, are quickened. Christ's death was the death of our sins; Christ's resurrection is the quickening of our souls. The law of ordinances, which was a yoke to the Jews, and a partition-wall to the Gentiles, the Lord Jesus took out of the way. When the substance was come, the shadows fled. Since every mortal man is, through the hand-writing of the law, guilty of death, how very dreadful is the condition of the ungodly and unholy, who trample under foot that blood of the Son of God, whereby alone this deadly hand-writing can be blotted out! Let not any be troubled about bigoted judgments which related to meats, or the Jewish solemnities. The setting apart a portion of our time for the worship and service of God, is a moral and unchangeable duty, but had no necessary dependence upon the seventh day of the week, the sabbath of the Jews. The first day of the week, or the Lord's day, is the time kept holy by Christians, in remembrance of Christ's resurrection. All the Jewish rites were shadows of gospel blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beware lest any man spoil you - The word "spoil" now commonly means, to corrupt, to cause to decay and perish, as fruit is spoiled by keeping too long, or paper by wetting, or hay by a long rain, or crops by mildew. But the Greek word used here means to spoil in the sense of plunder, rob, as when plunder is taken in war. The meaning is, "Take heed lest anyone plunder or rob you of your faith and hope by philosophy." These false teachers would strip them of their faith and hope, as an invading army would rob a country of all that was valuable.<p>Through philosophy - The Greek philosophy prevailed much in the regions around Colossae, and perhaps also the oriental or Gnostic philosophy. See the Introduction They were exposed to the influences of these plausible systems. They consisted much of speculations respecting the nature of the divine existence; and the danger of the Colossians was, that they would rely rather on the deductions of that specious reasoning, than on what they had been taught by their Christian teachers.<p>And vain deceit - Mere fallacy. The idea is, that the doctrines which were advanced in those systems were maintained by plausible, not by solid arguments; by considerations not fitted to lead to the truth, but to lead astray.<p>After the tradition of men - There appear to have been two sources of danger to which the Christians at Colesso were exposed, and to which the apostle in these cautions alludes, though he is not careful to distinguish them. The one was that arising from the Grecian philosophy; the other, from Jewish opinions. The latter is that to which he refers here. The Jews depended much on tradition (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a>); and many of those traditions would have tended much to corrupt the gospel of Christ.<p>After the rudiments of the world - Margin, elements.

The apostle does not condemn all philosophy, but "the philosophy" (so Greek) of the Judaic-oriental heretics at Colosse, which afterwards was developed into Gnosticism. You, who may have "the riches of full assurance" and "the treasures of wisdom," should not suffer yourselves to be led away as a spoil by empty, deceitful philosophy: "riches" are contrasted with spoil; "full" with "vain," or empty (Col 2:2, 3, 9).<p>after&#8212;"according to."<p>tradition of men&#8212;opposed to, "the fulness of the Godhead."

The false teachers boasted of a higher wisdom in theory, transmitted by tradition among the initiated; in practice they enjoined asceticism, as though matter and the body were the sources of evil.

Or despoil you; rob you of the rich treasure of the Gospel, strip you of your spiritual armour, take away from you the truths and doctrines of Christ, and divest you of your spiritual privileges and blessings; suggesting, that the false teachers were thieves and robbers, and men of prey: or drive and carry you away as spoils, as the innocent harmless sheep are drove, and carried away by wolves, and by the thief that comes to steal, to kill, and destroy; intimating, that such as these were the heretics of those times; wherefore it became them to be upon their guard, to watch, look out, and beware, lest they should be surprised by these deceitful workers, who lay in wait to deceive; were wolves in sheep's clothing, who transformed themselves into the apostles of Christ; and therefore it became them to take heed, lest any man hurt them, be he ever so wise and learned, or be thought ever so good, religious, and sincere; since men of this cast put on such masks and false appearances, on purpose to beguile. The things by which they imposed upon weak minds are as follow, and therefore to be shunned, avoided, and rejected: <p>through philosophy: not right philosophy, or true wisdom, the knowledge of God, of the things of nature, of things natural, moral, and civil; which may be attained unto by the use of reason, and light of nature. The apostle does not mean to condemn all arts and sciences, as useless and hurtful, such as natural philosophy in its various branches, ethics, logic, rhetoric, &amp;c. when kept within due bounds, and in their proper place and sphere; for with instances of these the Scriptures themselves abound; but he means that philosophy, or science, which is falsely so called, the false notions of philosophers; such as the eternity of matter, and of this world, the mortality of souls, the worshipping of demons and angels, &amp;c. and also such principles in philosophy, which in themselves, and in the things of nature, are true, but, when applied to divine things, to things above nature, the mere effects of divine power and grace, and of pure revelation, are false; as that out of nothing, nothing can be made, which in the things of nature is true, but not to be applied to the God of nature, who has made the world out of nothing; as also that from a privation to an habit there is no return, which is naturally true, but not to be applied to supernatural things, and supernatural agency; witness the miracles of Christ, in restoring sight to the blind, life to the dead, &amp;c. and therefore is not to be employed against the resurrection of the dead: philosophy may be useful as an handmaid; it is not to be a mistress in theological things; it may subserve, but not govern; it is not to be made use of as a judge, or rule in such matters; the natural man, on these principles, neither knows nor receives the things of the Spirit of God; judgment is not to be made and formed according to them; as of a trinity of persons in the Godhead; of the sonship of Christ, and his incarnation; of man's redemption by him, of reconciliation and satisfaction by his blood and sacrifice, of the pardon of sin, of a sinner's justification, of the resurrection of the dead, and such like articles of faith: that philosophy which is right, can only be a rule of judgment in things relating to it, and not in those which are out of its sphere: in a word, the apostle here condemns the philosophy of the Jews, and of the Gnostics; the former had introduced natural philosophy into the worship and service of God, and the things appertaining to their religion; and had made the tabernacle and temple, and the most holy place, and the things belonging thereunto, emblems and hieroglyphics of natural things; as of the sun, moon, and stars, and their influences, and of the four elements, and of moral virtue, &amp;c. as appears from the writings of Josephus (r), and Philo (s); when they were types and representatives of spiritual things under the Gospel dispensation; and the latter had brought in the philosophy of Pythagoras and Plato, concerning abstinences, purgations, sacrifices, and ceremonies of worship, given to demons and angels: in short, the apostle's meaning is, that philosophy is not to be mixed with the pure Gospel of Christ; it has always been fatal to it; witness the school of Pantaenus in Alexandria, in the early times of Christianity, by which the simplicity of the Gospel was greatly corrupted; and the race of schoolmen a few centuries ago, who introduced the philosophy of Aristotle, Averrois, and others, into all the subjects of divinity: to observe no more, such kind of philosophy is here meant, which may be truly called <p>vain deceit: that is, that which is vain and empty, and has no solid foundation, even in nature and reason itself; and which being applied to divine things and religious observances, is deceitful and delusory: <p>after the tradition of men; either of the Gentiles, who had their traditions in religion; or of the Jews, called the traditions of the elders, and of the fathers, which the Pharisees were fond of, by which they transgressed the commandments of God; which the apostle was brought up in, and was zealous of formerly, but now was delivered from, and rightly condemned as idle, trifling, and pernicious: <p>after the rudiments of the world, or "the elements of the world"; not the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water; or the worship of the sun, moon, and stars, &amp;c. among the idolatrous Gentiles, but the ceremonial laws of the Jews; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-8.htm">Galatians 4:8</a>; which were that to them in religion, as the A B C, or letters, are in grammar, the elements and rudiments of it; and though these were to them, when children, useful, but now under the Gospel dispensation are weak, beggarly, and useless, and not to be attended to: <p>and not after Christ; what he has taught and prescribed, the doctrines and commandments of Christ, the treasures of wisdom and knowledge which are in him; and therefore all such vain and deceitful philosophy, human traditions, and worldly rudiments, are to be rejected; Christ and his Gospel, the revelation he has made, are the standard of doctrine and worship; he only is to be heard and attended to, and whatever it contrary thereunto is to be guarded against, <p>(r) Antiqu. l. 3. c. 6. sect. 4. 7.

The <span class="greekheb">φιλοσοφία</span>, however, against which Paul utters his warning, is not <span class="ital">philosophy generally and in itself</span>,—a view at variance with the addition <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κενῆς ἀπατ</span>. closely pertaining to it, however much the wisdom of the world in its degeneracy (comp.

I. p. 236 ff., II. p. 132), as experience was conversant with its phenomena in that age,[87] may have manifested itself to the apostle as foolishness when compared with the wisdom of the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God.">1 Corinthians 1:18</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>). Rather, he has in view (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>) the characteristic speculation, <span class="ital">well known to his readers</span>, which engaged attention in Colossae and the surrounding district,[88] and consisted of a Gnostic theosophy mixed up with Judaism (Essenism). This is, on account of its nature directed to the supersensuous and its ontological character, correctly designated by the term philosophy in general, apart from its relation to the truth, which is signalized by the <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κενῆς ἀπάτης</span> appended.[89] (Plat. <span class="ital">Def</span>. p. 414 C: <span class="greekheb">τῆς τῶν <span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὌΝΤΕΝ ἈΕῚ ἘΠΙΣΤΉΜΗς ὌΡΕΞΙς</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἝΞΙς ΘΕΩΡΗΤΙΚῊ ΤΟῦ ἈΛΗΘΟῦς</span>, <span class="greekheb">Πῶς ἈΛΗΘΈς</span></span></span>). Possibly it was also put forward by the false teachers themselves expressly under this designation (comp. the Sophists as the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΆΣΚΟΝΤΕς ΦΙΛΟΣΟΦΕῖΝ</span></span></span>, Xen. <span class="ital">Mem</span>. i. 2. 19; and <span class="greekheb">οἰόμενοι πάντʼ εἰδέναι</span>, in i. 4. 1). The latter is the more probable, since Paul uses the word only in this passage. Comp. Bengel: “quod adversarii jactabant esse philosophiam et sapientiam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm" title=" Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.">Colossians 2:23</a>), id Paulus <span class="ital">inanem fraudem</span> esse dicit.” The nature of this philosophy is consequently to be regarded as <span class="ital">Judaistic-Oriental;</span>[90] we are under no necessity to infer from the word <span class="greekheb">φιλοσοφία</span> a reference to <span class="ital">Greek</span> wisdom, as Grotius did, suggesting the <span class="ital">Pythagorean</span> (Clemens Alexandrinus thought of the <span class="ital">Epicureans</span>, and Tertullian of such philosophers as Paul had to do with at <span class="ital">Athens</span>). The idea that the “<span class="ital">sacrarum literarum</span> earumque recte interpretandarum <span class="ital">scientia</span>” (Tittmann, <span class="ital">de vestigiis Gnosticor. in N. T. frustra quaesitis</span>, p. 86 ff.) is meant, is opposed, not to the word in itself, but to the marks of heretical doctrine in our Epistle, and to the usage of the apostle, who never so designates the O. T. teaching and exposition, however frequently he speaks of it; although Philo gives it this name (see Loesner, <span class="ital">Obss</span>. p. 364), and Josephus (see Krebs, p. 236) applies it to the systems of Jewish sects, and indeed the Fathers themselves apply it to the Christian doctrine (Suicer, <span class="ital">Thes. s.v</span>.); see Grimm on <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/1-1.htm" title="The brethren, the Jews that be at Jerusalem and in the land of Judea, wish unto the brethren, the Jews that are throughout Egypt health and peace:">2Ma 1:1</a>, p. 298 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κατὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">παράδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>.] might be—and this is the common view—closely joined with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΆΤΗς</span></span></span> (Winer, p. 128 f. [E. T. 169]). But the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Οὐ ΚΑΤᾺ ΧΡΙΣΤΌΝ</span></span></span> would not suit this connection, since <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΆΤΗ</span></span></span> is already in itself a definite and proper idea, in association with which a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤᾺ ΧΡΙΣΤΌΝ</span></span></span> would be inconceivable; whereas the <span class="ital">figurative <span class="greekheb">συλαγωγεῖν</span></span> still admits also the negative modal statement (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Οὐ ΚΑΤᾺ Χ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>) for greater definiteness. Accordingly <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤᾺ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΠΑΡΆΔ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> (comp. Steiger, Ellicott) is to be taken as definition of mode to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΛΑΓΩΓῶΝ</span></span></span>. Paul, namely, having previously announced <span class="ital">whereby</span> the <span class="greekheb">συλαγωγεῖν</span> takes place, now adds for the still more precise description of that procedure, in order the more effectively to warn his readers against it, <span class="ital">that in accordance with which</span> it takes place, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. what is the objective <span class="ital">regulative standard</span> by which they permit themselves to be guided. He does this <span class="ital">positively</span> (<span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν</span> … <span class="greekheb">κόσμου</span>) and <span class="ital">negatively</span> (<span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐ κατὰ Χριστόν</span>). The genitive <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῶΝ ἈΝΘΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is to be explained: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἫΝ ΠΑΡΈΛΑΒΕ ΠΑΡᾺ ΤῶΝ ἈΝΘΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>), and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῶΝ</span></span></span> denotes the <span class="ital">category</span>, the traditio <span class="ital">humana</span> as such, opposed to the divine revelation. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-8.htm" title="For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things you do.">Mark 7:8</a>.

The expression in itself embraces the ritual observances[91] both of <span class="ital">Judaism and heathenism</span>, which, in comparison with the perfect religion of Christianity, are only “puerilia <span class="ital">rudimenta</span>” (Calvin), as it were the A B C of religion, so that Paul therefore in this case also, where he warns his readers against <span class="ital">Judaistic</span> enticing, characterizes the matter according to its <span class="ital">category</span>. As to the designation itself and its various interpretations, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>. Among the latest expositors, Bleek agrees with our view, while Hofmann explains: “because it (the philosophy which is described as deceit) permits <span class="ital">the material things, of which the created world consists</span>, to form its standard.” See in opposition to this on Gal. <span class="ital">l.c</span>. Both expressions, <span class="greekheb">τὴν παράδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>. and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤᾺ ΣΤΟΙΧ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΚΌΣΜΟΥ</span></span></span>, have it as their aim to render apparent the worthlessness and unsuitableness for the Christian standpoint (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>). Hence, also, the contrast which, though obvious of itself, is nevertheless emphatic: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ Οὐ ΚΑΤᾺ ΧΡΙΣΤΌΝ</span></span></span>. The activity of that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΥΛΑΓΩΓΕῖΝ</span></span></span> <span class="ital">has not Christ for its objective standard;</span> He, in accordance with His divine dignity exalted above everything (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>), was to be the sole regulative for all activity in Christian teaching, so that the standard guiding their work should be found in the relation of dependence upon Him; but instead of this the procedure of the <span class="greekheb">συλαγωγῶν</span> allows human tradition, and those non-Christian rudiments which the Christian is supposed to have long since left behind, to serve as his rule of conduct! How unworthy it is, therefore, to follow such seduction!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[87] Comp. Luther’s frequent denunciations of philosophy, under which he had present to his mind its degeneracy in the Aristotelian scholasticism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[88] Comp. also Calovius.

Paul once more (previously in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-4.htm" title=" And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.">Colossians 2:4</a>) begins to attack the false teachers, but turns aside in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a> from the direct attack to lay the basis for the decisive attack in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:...">Colossians 2:16-23</a>.—<span class="greekheb">τις</span>. It is not clear that we can infer from the singular that only one false teacher had appeared in the Colossian Church.—<span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> is placed in an emphatic position, and its force is “you whose Christian course has been so fair, and who have received such exhortations to remain steadfast”.—<span class="greekheb">ἔσται</span>: the future indicative after <span class="greekheb">μή</span> implies a more serious estimate of the danger than the subjunctive.

The sense is disputed. Several of the Fathers and some modern writers think it means “to rob”. It is used in this sense with <span class="greekheb">οἶκον</span> (Aristaen., 2, 22), and Field (<span class="ital">Notes on the Translation of the N.T.</span>, p. 195) says “there can be no better rendering than ‘lest any man <span class="ital">rob</span> you’ ”. But, as Soden points out, that of which they were robbed should have been expressed. It is better to take it with most commentators in the more obvious sense “lead you away as prey”. The verb is so used in Heliod., Æth., x., 35 (with <span class="greekheb">θυγατέρα</span>), Nicet., Hist., 5, 96 (with <span class="greekheb">παρθένον</span>), and it may be chosen with the special sense of seduction in mind.—<span class="greekheb">διὰ τῆς φιλοσοφίας καὶ κενῆς ἀπάτης</span>. The second noun is explanatory of the first, as is shown by the absence of the article and preposition before it and the lack of any indication that Paul had two evils to attack. The meaning is “his philosophy, which is vain deceit”. The word has, of course, no reference to Greek philosophy, and probably none to the allegorical method of Scripture exegesis that the false teachers may have employed. Philo uses it of the law of Judaism, and Josephus of the three Jewish sects. Here, no doubt, it means just the false teaching that threatened to undermine the faith of the Church. There is no condemnation of philosophy in itself, but simply of the empty, but plausible, sham that went by that name at Colossæ. Hort thinks that the sense is akin to the later usage of the word to denote the ascetic life.—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν παράδοσιν τῶν ἀνθρώπων</span>: “according to human tradition” as opposed to Divine revelation. Meyer, Ellicott and Findlay connect with <span class="greekheb">συλαγ</span>.

To these may now be added St. John Thackeray, <span class="ital">The Relation of St. Paul to Contemporary Jewish Thought</span>, pp. 163–170, and Deissmann’s article “Elements” in the <span class="ital">Encyclopædia Biblica</span>.] Originally <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. meant the letters of the alphabet, then in Plato and later writers the physical elements, and lastly (but only from the first century A.D.) the rudiments of knowledge. It has been frequently taken in this sense as the A B C of religious knowledge (so recently Mey., Lightf., Ol., Cremer and many others). This explanation had, however, been attacked by Neander with powerful arguments in his discussion of the parallel passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>. (<span class="ital">Planting and Training</span>, i., 465, 466, <span class="ital">cf.</span> 323 [Bohn’s ed.].) He pointed out that if <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. meant first principles we should have had a genitive of the object, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm" title="For when for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.">Hebrews 5:12</a>, <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀρχῆς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λογίων</span>. Such an omission of the leading idea is inadmissible. Further, Paul regarded the heathen as enslaved under <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κός</span>. and their falling away to Jewish rites as a return to this slavery. Therefore the expression must apply to something both had in common, and something condemned by Paul, which cannot be the first principles of religion (to which also <span class="greekheb">ἀσθενῆ</span> would be inappropriate), but the ceremonial observances, which were so called as earthly and material. It has been further pointed out by Klöpper that following <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">παρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>. this term introduced by <span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span> and not connected by <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> must express the content of the teaching, which is not very suitable if “religious rudiments” is the meaning. Nor is it true that the false teachers gave elementary instruction. If this view be set aside, as suiting neither the expression in itself nor the context in which it occurs, the question arises whether we should return to the interpretation of several Fathers, that the heavenly bodies are referred to. These were called <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖα</span> (examples are given in Valesius on <span class="ital">Eus. H. E.</span>, v., 24, Hilg. <span class="ital">l.c.</span>). This is favoured by the reference to “days, and months, and seasons, and years” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-11.htm" title="I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed on you labor in vain.">Galatians 4:11</a>, immediately following the mention of <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>, for these were regulated by the heavenly bodies. But it is unsatisfactory, for the context in which the expression occurs, especially in Galatians, points to personal beings. In this passage the contrast of <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">Χριστόν</span> is fully satisfied only if the former are personal. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a> Paul applies the illustration of the heir under “guardians and stewards” to the pre-Christian world under the <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>., and here again a personal reference is forcibly suggested. Still more is this the case with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-8.htm" title="However, then, when you knew not God, you did service to them which by nature are no gods....">Galatians 4:8-9</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a> Paul says <span class="greekheb">ἐδουλεύσατε τοῖς φύσει μὴ οὖσι θεοῖς</span>. In the next verse he asks “how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly <span class="greekheb">στ</span>., to which you wish to be in bondage (<span class="greekheb">δουλεῦσαι</span>) over again?” This clearly identifies <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">φύς</span>. <span class="greekheb">μὴ οὖσι θεοῖς</span>, and therefore proves their personality, which is suggested also by <span class="greekheb">ἐδουλ</span>.; accordingly they cannot be the heavenly bodies or the physical elements of the world. Hilgenfeld, followed by Lipsius, Holsten and Klöpper, regards them as the astral spirits, the angels of the heavenly bodies. That the latter were regarded as animated by angels is certain, for we find this belief in Philo and Enoch (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-7.htm" title="When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?">Job 38:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm" title="Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no ficklenss, neither shadow of turning.">Jam 1:17</a>). But it is strange that the spirits of the stars should be called <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κόσμου</span>. And while they determine the seasons and festivals, they have nothing to do with many ceremonial observances, such as abstinence from meats and drinks. Spitta (followed by Everling, Sod., Haupt, and apparently Abb.) has the merit of giving the true interpretation. According to the later Jewish theology, not only the stars but all things had their special angels. The proof of this belongs to a discussion of angelology, and must be assumed here. <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κός</span>. are therefore the elemental spirits which animate all material things. They are so called from the elements which they animate, and are identical with the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαὶ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>, who receive this name from their sphere of authority. Thus all the abstinence from material things, submission to material ordinances and so forth, involve a return to their service. We need not, with Ritschl, limit the reference to the angels of the law, though they are included. Thus interpreted the passage gains its full relevance to the context, and to the angel worship of the false teachers which Paul is attacking. The chief objection to this explanation is that we have no parallel for this usage of the word, except in the <span class="ital">Test. Sol.</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς ἐσμὲν τὰ λεγόμενα στοιχεῖα</span>, <span class="greekheb">οἱ κοσμοκράτορες τοῦ κόσμου τούτου</span>. But this is late. The term is used in this sense in modern Greek. In spite of this the exegetical proof that personal beings are meant is too strong to be set aside. So we must explain, “philosophy having for its subject-matter the elemental spirits”.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐ κατὰ Χριστόν</span> must be taken similarly, not having Christ for its subject-matter. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. means the person of Christ, not teaching about Christ, and is opposed simply to <span class="greekheb">στ</span>., not to <span class="greekheb">παρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>.

The Greek word is not known in earlier Greek literature, but its form leaves no doubt of its meaning.—The false teachers would not merely “despoil” the Colossians of certain spiritual convictions and blessings, but would lead <span class="ital">them</span> away captives, as their deluded adherents and devotees. Lightfoot compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-6.htm" title="For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,">2 Timothy 3:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">through philosophy … deceit</span>] We may fairly represent the Greek, sacrificing precise literality, thus: <span class="bld">through his empty deceit of a philosophy</span>. No doubt the false teachers posed as great intellectualists, and took care to present their “gospel” as something congruous in kind with existing speculations, Greek or Eastern, about knowing and being. They would say little or nothing like “<span class="ital">Thus it is written</span>, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise … and that repentance and remission … should be preached in His name” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/24-46.htm" title="And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:...">Luke 24:46-47</a>); but rather “Thus the finite stands related to the Infinite; thus spirit is eternally differenced from matter, and thus it secures its emancipation from its material chain.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lightfoot in an interesting note traces the word “<span class="ital">Philosophy</span>” from its alleged origin in the modesty of Pythagoras (cent. 6 b.c.), who declined the title of “<span class="ital">wise</span>” (<span class="ital">sophos</span>), preferring that of “<span class="ital">wisdom-lover</span>” (<span class="ital">philosophos</span>), to its later association with “subtle dialectics and profitless speculation,” as in St Paul’s age. And he remarks on two different views about pagan Philosophy represented among the Fathers; that of e.g. Clement of Alexandria (cent. 2–3), who regarded it as “not only a preliminary training … for the Gospel, but even as in some sense a covenant … given by God to the Greeks”; and that of e.g. Tertullian (at the same date) who saw a positive antithesis between “the philosopher” and “the Christian.” Lightfoot remarks that St Paul’s speech at Athens “shows that his sympathies would have been at least as strong” with Clement as with Tertullian. Can we go quite so far? Surely the <span class="ital">main drift</span> of his teaching emphasizes the tendency of independent speculation—not to discover facts destructive of the Gospel; no such timid misgivings beset him; but—to foster mental habits hostile to a submissive welcome to the Gospel. Cp. esp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.">1 Corinthians 1:17</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-23.htm" title="And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Folly indeed it is,” says Quesnel, “to seek to establish a science wholly Divine on foundations wholly human.

Strictly, it means what is “<span class="ital">handed on</span>,” and so may mean, by connexion, either (as here) an esoteric “<span class="ital">deposit</span>,” passed down as it were along the line of the initiated, or simply “<span class="ital">teaching</span>,” the conveyance of opinion or knowledge in any way from one mind to another.—It is remarkable that in this latter sense, very commonly, the word “tradition” is used by the Fathers to mean simply Scripture; “<span class="ital">evangelic</span>” or “<span class="ital">apostolic tradition</span>” denoting respectively <span class="ital">the teaching</span> of <span class="ital">the Gospels</span> and <span class="ital">the Epistles</span>.—Here, however, obviously the word inclines to its worse reference; the more or less esoteric teaching about things unseen, “handed on” in the heretical circles, not published in the daylight.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of men</span>] Whereas the Apostle’s mission and Gospel was “not of men, neither by man” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)">Galatians 1:1</a>) nor “according to man” (<span class="ital">ibid</span>., 11). He “neither received it of man, nor was taught it, but by revelation from Jesus Christ” (<span class="ital">ibid</span>., 12). Nothing is more emphatic in St Paul than this assertion of the strictly and directly superhuman, Divine, origin of the Gospel as a message.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">rudiments</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm" title="Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:">Galatians 4:3</a>.—The Greek word means a first beginning, or principle (see Liddell and Scott’s <span class="ital">Greek Lexicon</span>, under <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖον</span>), for instance, as a simple vocal <span class="ital">sound</span> (that e.g. of the letter <span class="ital">r</span>) is a first element in speech. Hence it comes to mean “<span class="ital">an element</span>” in knowledge, or instruction; and hence, elementary instruction. The same word also denoted the <span class="ital">heavenly bodies</span>, regarded as the <span class="ital">first grounds</span> of measurement of time; and many ancient expositors saw this meaning here, as if the Apostle had in view the observance of “days, and months, and seasons, and years” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-10.htm" title="You observe days, and months, and times, and years.">Galatians 4:10</a>). But Lightfoot points out that (<span class="ital">a</span>) the reference here is to some <span class="ital">mode of teaching</span>, (<span class="ital">b</span>) the observance of “times” was too subordinate a factor in the errors in question to be thus named as a part for the whole.

And now, after a general indication in ver. 4 of the direction in which he is about to strike, he unmasks the battery he has been all the while preparing, and delivers his <span class="accented">attack on the Colossian error</span>, occupying the rest of this second chapter, he denounces <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> its false philosophy of religion (vers. 8-15); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> its arbitrary and obsolete ceremonialism (vers. 16, 17); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> its visionary angel worship (vers. 18, 19); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> its ascetic rules (vers. 20-22; ver. 23) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>reviewing the whole system in a brief characterization of its most prominent and dangerous features. It will be convenient to treat separately the first of these topics, under the heading already given, which indicates the positive truth developed by St. Paul in antagonism to the error against which he contends - a truth which is the practical application of the theological teaching of the first chapter. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beware lest there shall be some one who maketh you his spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit</span> (vers. 4, 18, 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1, 4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>). "Beware;" literally, <span class="accented">see</span> (<span class="accented">to</span> it), a common form of warning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-17.htm">Colossians 4:17</a>). The future indicative" shall be," used instead of the more regular subjunctive "should be," implies that what is feared is too likely to prove the case (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> and (with another tense) <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>). "Some one who maketh (you) his spoil (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)" is an expression so distinct and individualizing that it appears to single out a definite, well known person. The denunciations of this Epistle are throughout in the <span class="accented">singular</span> number (vers. 4, 16, 18), in marked contrast with the <span class="accented">plural</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, and that prevails in the apostle's earlier polemical references. It is in harmony with the philosophical, Gnosticizing character of the Colossian heresy that it should rest on the authority of some single teacher, rather than on Scripture or tradition, as did the conservative legalistic Judaism. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, a very rare word, <span class="accented">hapax legomenon</span> in the New Testament, bears its meaning on its face. It indicates the selfish, partisan spirit, and the overbearing conduct of the false teacher. Against such men St. Paul had forewarned the Ephesian elders (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29, 30</a>). "And empty deceit" stands in a qualifying apposition to "philosophy:" "His philosophy, indeed! "It is no better than a vain deceit." This kind of irony we shall find the writer using with still greater effect in ver. 18. <span class="accented">Deceit is empty</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-6.htm">Ephesians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>; distinguish from <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">fruitless, vain</span>), which deceives by being a show of what it is not, <span class="accented">a hollow pretence.</span> From the prominence given to this aspect of the new teaching, we infer that it claimed to be a <span class="accented">philosophy</span>, and made this its special distinction and ground of superiority. And this consideration points (comp. Introduction, &sect; 4), to some connection between the system of the Colossian errorists and the Alexandrine Judaism, of which Philo, an elder contemporary of St. Paul, is our chief exponent. The aim of this school, which had now existed for two centuries at least, and had diffused its ideas far and wide, was to transform and sublimate Judaism by interpreting it under philosophical principles. Its teachers endeavoured, in fact, to put the "new wine" of Plato into the old bottles" of Moses, persuading themselves that it was originally there (comp. note on "mystery," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). In Philo, <span class="accented">philosophy</span> is the name for true religion, whose essence consists in the pursuit and contemplation of pure spiritual truth. Moses and the patriarchs are, with him, all "philosophers;" the writers of the Old Testament" philosophize;" it is" the philosophical man" who holds converse with God. This is the only place where <span class="accented">philosophy</span> is expressly mentioned in the New Testament; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a> and context it is, however, only verbally wanting. According to the tradition of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ (vers. 17, 20, 22; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-8.htm">Mark 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-5.htm">1 John 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>). This clause qualifies "making spoil" (Meyer, Ellicott) rather than "deceit;" human authority and natural reason furnish the principles and the method <span class="accented">according to</span> which the false teacher proceeds. "Tradition" does not necessarily imply antiquity (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-2.htm">1 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>); "of men" is the emphatic part of the phrase. These words are characteristic of St. Paul, who was so profoundly conscious of the supernatural origin of his own doctrine (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm">John 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-5.htm">1 John 4:5</a>). Similarly, "the rudiments of the world" are the crude beginnings of truth, the childishly faulty and imperfect religious conceptions and usages to which the world had attained apart from the revelation of Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3, 9</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, for this use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>). It is not either Jewish or non-Jewish <span class="accented">elements</span> specifically that are intended. Jew and Greek are one in so far as their religious ideas are "not according to Christ." Greek thought had also contributed its <span class="accented">rudiments</span> to the world's education for Christ: hence, comprehensively, "the rudiments of <span class="accented">the world</span> "(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-21.htm">1 Corinthians 1:21</a>). The blending of Greek and Jewish elements in the Colossian theosophy would of itself suggest this generalization, already shadowed forth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>. Neander, Hofmann, and Klopper (the latest German commentator), have returned to the view that prevailed amongst the Fathers, from Origen downwards, reading this phrase, both here and in Galatians, in a physical sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 12</a>; the <span class="accented">elementa mundi</span>, "the powers of nature," "heavenly bodies," etc., worshipped by the Gentiles as gods, and which the Jews identified with the angels (ver. 18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>) as God's agents in the direction of the world. This interproration has much to recommend it, but it scarcely harmonizes with the parallel "tradition of men," still less with the context of ver. 20, and is absolutely at variance, as it seems to us, with the argument involved in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>. Not the doctrine of Christ, but <span class="accented">Christ himself</span> is the substitute for these discarded <span class="accented">rudiments</span> (vers. 17, 20). His Person is the norm and test of truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1-3</a>). The views combatted were "not according to Christ," for they made him something less and lower than that which he is. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Beware (&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Lit., see to it.<p>Lest any man spoil you (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>The Greek is more precise and personal: lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil.

A very strong expression for the work of the false teachers; make you yourselves a booty. The A.V. is ambiguous, and might be taken to mean corrupt or damage you.<p>Philosophy and vain deceit (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev. gives the force of the article, his philosophy: &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; and is explanatory, philosophy which is also vain deceit. Hence the warning is not against all philosophy. &#x3a6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, philosophy, only here in the New Testament. It had originally a good meaning, the love of wisdom, but is used by Paul in the sense of vain speculation and with special reference to its being the name by which the false teachers at Colossae designated not only their speculative system, but also their practical system, so that it covered their ascetic practices no less than their mysticism. Bishop Lightfoot remarks upon the fact that philosophy, by which the Greeks expressed the highest effort of the intellect, and virtue (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;), their expression for the highest moral excellence, are each used but once by Paul, showing "that the Gospel had deposed the terms as inadequate to the higher standard, whether of knowledge or practice, which it had introduced."<p>After the tradition<p>Connect with the whole phrase philosophy and vain deceit, as descriptive of its source and subject matter. Others connect with make spoil. The term is especially appropriate to the Judaeo-Gnostic teachings in Colossae, which depended for their authority, not on ancient writings, but on tradition. The later mystical theology or metaphysic of the Jews was called Kabbala, literally meaning reception or received doctrines, tradition.<p>Rudiments (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3b1;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>.

Ceremonialism - meats, drinks, washings, Essenic asceticism, pagan symbolic mysteries and initiatory rites - all belonged to a rudimentary moral stage.
