St. Paul evidently takes up here a word, used by the pretenders to a special and abstruse knowledge, and applies it to the “heavenly things” which He alone knows “who is in heaven” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-12.htm" title="If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?">John 3:12-13</a>). From our full comprehension they are hidden; if ever we know them, it will not be till “we know even as we are known.” But the previous words show that we can have full practical apprehension of them by our knowledge of Christ, who knows them—a knowledge begun in faith, and perfected chiefly in love.<p><span class= "bld">Wisdom and knowledge.</span>—Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm" title="O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!">Romans 11:33</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;">1Corinthians 12:8</a> (“the word of wisdom” . . . “the word of knowledge”). On the true sense of “wisdom” and its relation to other less perfect gifts, as “prudence,” “intelligence,” “knowledge,” see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-8.htm" title="Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;">Ephesians 1:8</a>. “Knowledge” is clearly the development of wisdom in spiritual perception, as “intelligence” in testing and harmonising such perception, and “prudence” in making them, so tested, the guide of life. The word “knowledge” (<span class= "ital">gnosis</span>) was the word which, certainly afterwards, probably even then, was the watchword of “Gnosticism”—the unbridled and fantastic spirit of metaphysical and religious speculation then beginning to infest all Christian thought. It can hardly be accidental that St. Paul here, as elsewhere, subordinates it to the higher gift of wisdom.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The soul prospers when we have clear knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In whom - Margin, "wherein."

Translate in the Greek order, "In whom (not as Alford, 'in which') mystery; Christ is Himself the 'mystery' (Col 2:2; 1Ti 3:16), and to Christ the relative refers) are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden." The "all" here, answers to "all" in Col 2:2; as "treasures" answer to the "riches"; it is from the treasures that the riches (Col 2:2) are derived. "Are" is the predicate of the sentence; all the treasures ARE in Him; hidden is predicated of the state or manner in which they are in Him. Like a mine of unknown and inexhaustible wealth, the treasures of wisdom are all in Him hidden, but not in order to remain so; they only need to be explored for you to attain "unto the riches" in them (Col 2:2); but until you, Colossians, press after attaining the full knowledge (see on [2413]Col 2:2) of them, they remain "hidden." Compare the parable, Mt 13:44, "treasure hid." This sense suits the scope of the apostle, and sets aside Alford's objection that "the treasures are not hidden, but revealed." "Hidden" plainly answers to "mystery" (Col 2:2), which is designed by God, if we be faithful to our privileges, not to remain hidden, but to be revealed (compare 1Co 2:7, 8). Still as the mine is unfathomable, there will, through eternity, be always fresh treasures in Him to be drawn forth from their hidden state.<p>wisdom&#8212;general, and as to experimental and practical truth; whence comes "understanding" (Col 2:2).<p>knowledge&#8212;special and intellectual, in regard to doctrinal truth; whence comes "the full knowledge" (Col 2:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In whom:</span> this may relate eitter to the Divine mystery, wherein are in abundance all necessary doctrines to consolation and salvation stored up, respecting the foregoing verse; compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:">1 Corinthians 2:7</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-3.htm" title="How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,">Ephesians 3:3</a>,4</span>; in opposition to the vain show of wisdom seducers did boast of; or, (as the most ancient and modern take it), to Christ, the immediate antecedent: <span class="ital">in whom, </span>( as we render it), i.e. in Christ, considered either: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Continuing the metaphor, he shows from what fund the treasures of saving knowledge may be drawn: by <span class="ital">treasures</span> intimating the excellency and abundance thereof; there was some store in the tabernacle of Moses, but very small compared to the abundance certainly to be found in Christ, all else of no worth to the excellency of the knowledge of Christ for consolation, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm" title="Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,">Philippians 3:8</a></span>: things to be believed and practised are, by way of eminency, Christian <span class="ital">wisdom and knowledge.</span> The <span class="ital">treasures</span> of which, how and when hid, is to be well considered, because in our translation, and in almost all others, the Greek word we render <span class="ital">hid</span> is by trajection put next to the relative <span class="ital">whom, </span> whereas it is indeed in the original the last word in the verse, and seems to be expressive rather of what was hid before Christ than what is hid in him.

So that it shonld seem best to retain <span class="ital">hid</span> as it is placed in the Greek, to this sense; q.d. In Christ are, and dwell in the greatest fulness, all the treasures of wisdom, hid under the law, which are therefore called a mystery, secret, or hidden thing from ages and generations, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm" title=" Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:">Colossians 1:26</a>,27</span>, now made manifest to his saints, they are now not hid in Christ, but made known amongst the Gentiles as God willed.

However, if any will rather choose to read, as if in Christ were at present hid all treasures, it is to be understood, stored up, not exposed to the view of every eye, being as in a rich cabinet, not to keep them from being known to men, but rather to make them more precious and desirable.

Wherefore both may be true in divers respects: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Consider the thing in itself, objectively; so treasures of wisdom are evidently laid up in Jesus Christ, and manifested upon his appearance, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-11.htm" title="For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,">Titus 2:11</a></span>. But: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. With respect to the eyes and perceptions of men, subjectively, as naturally obscured and corrupted by sin; so natural men, or mere animal men, perceive not in Christ the riches of wisdom and knowledge which are in him as our Mediator, when they look upon him as having no beauty or comeliness for which they should desire him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-2.htm" title="For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.">Isaiah 53:2</a></span>; he, as crucified, being to the Jews <span class="ital">a stumbling-block</span> and to the Gentiles <span class="ital">foolishness, </span> when he is to those of them who are called, <span class="ital">the power of God, and the wisdom of God, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>,24</span>. The Lutherans’ inference hence, that omnisciency agrees to Christ’s human nature, is altogether inconsequent; both (as before) because the apostle’s business here is not to acquaint us what Christ himself knoweth, but what is to be known by us, which may be found treasured up in him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Treasures</span> here in him not being considered absolutely, but comparatively to all the knowledge of men and angels.

This may be understood either of the mystery of the Gospel, which contains the rich mines and hidden treasures of all divine truths; so called, because of the richness and intrinsic value and excellency of them; and because of their variety and abundance, being the unsearchable riches of Christ: or of Christ himself; and not so much of his personal wisdom, either as God, being the all-wise God, the wisdom of God, an omniscient Being, that knows all persons and things whatever, within the whole circle of wisdom and knowledge; or as man, whose wisdom and knowledge, though created, was very large and abundant; or as Mediator, on whom the spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and of knowledge, rests; but of that fulness of truth as well as grace, which dwells in him as in its subject and fountain; by whom it comes, and from whom it is derived unto us; and our highest wisdom and knowledge lies in knowing him, whom to know is life eternal; and the excellency of whose knowledge surpasses everything else; it is the greatest riches, and most valuable treasure; nor is there anything worth knowing but what is in Christ, all is laid up in him: and being said to be "hid" in him, shows the excellency of the wisdom and knowledge that is in him only valuable things being hid, or compared to hid treasure; that this cannot be had without knowing him; that it is imperfect in the present state, and is not yet fully and clearly revealed; and therefore should be inquired after, and searched for, and Christ should be applied unto for it: , "treasures of wisdom", is a phrase used by the Targumist (q), <p>(q) Jonathan ben Uzziel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/40.htm">Exodus 40</a>.4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">In whom are hid all the treasures of <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> wisdom and knowledge.</span><p>(d) There is no true wisdom outside of Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm" title=" In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.">Colossians 2:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ᾧ</span>] is to be referred to <span class="greekheb">τοῦ μυστηρίου</span>—a remark which applies also in the case of every other reading of the foregoing words—not to <span class="ital">Christ</span>,[81] as is commonly done with the <span class="ital">Recepta</span>, and by Böhmer, Dalmer, and Hofmann even with our reading.

For this we should have expected <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἀπόκρ</span>., and there is no stress on the fact that the hidden treasures are in Christ, yet the position of the word at the end of the sentence is explained as due to emphasis. Generally Chrysostom has been followed in taking it as the predicate to <span class="greekheb">εἰσὶν</span>, “in whom are hidden all the treasures”. But this is excluded by its distance from the verb. Accordingly it should be taken as a secondary predicate, and thus equivalent to an adverb, “in whom are all the treasures … hidden,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, in whom all the treasures are, and are in a hidden manner (Hofm., Ell., Lightf., Sod., Haupt, Abb.). The force of the passage then is this; all, and not merely some of, the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are contained in Christ, therefore the search for them outside of Him is doomed to failure. But not only are they in Christ, but they are contained in a hidden way. Therefore they do not lie on the surface, but must be sought for earnestly, as men seek for hidden treasure. They are not matters of external observances, such as the false teachers enjoined, but to be apprehended by deep and serious meditation. If Lightfoot is right in thinking that <span class="greekheb">ἀπόκρ</span>. is borrowed from the terminology of the false teachers, there is the added thought that the wisdom they fancied they found in their secret books was really to be found in Christ alone. But it is hardly likely that there is any such reference here. Even if the allusion to literature were more plausible than it is, there is no evidence that the word was used in this sense so early. Besides it occurs twice with <span class="greekheb">θης</span>. in the LXX. The distinction between <span class="greekheb">σοφίας</span> and <span class="greekheb">γνώσεως</span> is not easy to make here; the former is general, the latter special. Lightfoot says: “While <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> applies chiefly to the apprehension of truths, <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> super-adds the power of reasoning about them and tracing their relations”. Moule thinks it is God’s wisdom and knowledge that are here attributed to Christ, but this seems uncertain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">in whom</span>] Christ, the Secret of God, is now <span class="ital">characterized</span> as such; the Secret is—<span class="ital">Christ as the Treasury of wisdom and knowledge</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">are hid</span> &c.] Better, regarding the order of the Greek, <span class="bld">in whom are all the treasures</span>, &c., <span class="bld">hidden</span> (<span class="bld">there</span>).

So “<span class="ital">all riches</span>” just above; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-19.htm" title=" For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;">Colossians 1:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the treasures</span>] A rich (and frequent) plural.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wisdom and knowledge</span>] Words recurring together <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm" title="O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!">Romans 11:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-8.htm" title="For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;">1 Corinthians 12:8</a>. In such a passage they are scarcely perhaps to be minutely distinguished[82] (as they must be in 1 Corinthians 12); they blend into the one idea of the resources of the Divine Mind. For surely here, as in Romans 11 (a near parallel), it is the wisdom and knowledge <span class="ital">of God</span> which are in view; a point not noticed by Ellicott, Alford, or Lightfoot. (There is doubtless a <span class="ital">reflected</span> reference here to human speculation, exercised upon the treasures of Divine thought.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[82] Where wisdom (<span class="ital">sophia</span>) and knowledge (<span class="ital">gnôsis</span>) have to be distinguished, the essential difference appears to be that <span class="ital">sophia</span> is a moral-mental term, <span class="ital">gnôsis</span> a term purely mental, or rather one which fixes attention on the cognition of truth simply as such. Conceivably, the man of “knowledge” <span class="ital">may</span> stop with a mere sight of truth; the man of “wisdom” reflects upon it, receives it, in a way affecting character and action. The words “wise.” “wisdom”, in the Greek, are thus “never in Scripture ascribed to other than God or good men, except in an ironical sense” (Trench, <span class="ital">N.T. Synonyms</span>, 2nd Series).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The treasures of this Divine “wisdom and knowledge” are in Christ “<span class="ital">hiddenly</span>” (Ellicott), inasmuch as they are (<span class="ital">a</span>) to be found in Him alone, (<span class="ital">b</span>) to be found therefore only by entrance into Him, (<span class="ital">c</span>) never, even so, to be “found out unto perfection.”—The Greek word, as Lightfoot shews, is in all likelihood borrowed from the heretical vocabulary, and transfigured. The embryo “Gnostic” of St Paul’s days probably, as his successors certainly, gloried in an alleged possession of inner, esoteric, secrets of being and of knowing, treasured in books thence called <span class="ital">apocryphal</span> (<span class="ital">secret, hidden</span>); a word identical with the Greek adjective here (<span class="ital">apocruphoi</span>). (So that, in the Fathers, by “apocryphal” books are not meant the Jewish religious books we commonly call so, but the “secret” literature of the heretical sects.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Christ is thus the glorious “Apocrypha” (if we may dare to say so) of the Christian; our “esoteric wisdom” is only an ever-deepening insight into Him revealed.—“Jesus Christ is a great Book. He who can indeed study Him in the word of God will know all he ought to know. Humility opens this Divine Book, faith reads in it, love learns from it” (Quesnel).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/colossians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm" title=" In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.">Colossians 2:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ᾧ</span>) <span class="ital">in Whom</span>, rather <span class="ital">in which</span>, viz. the mystery of God and the Father and of Christ.

Bengel, Meyer, Alford, and others make the relative pronoun neuter, referring to "mystery;" but "Christ," the nearer antecedent, is preferable (vers. 9, 10; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16, 17, 19</a>). <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">him</span> the apostle finds what false teachers sought elsewhere, a satisfaction for the intellect as well as for the heart - <span class="accented">treasures of wisdom and knowledge</span> to enrich the understanding, and unsearchable mysteries to exercise the speculative reason. "Hidden" is, therefore, a secondary predicate: in whom are these treasures, - as hidden treasures" (Ellicott, Lightfoot). (For a similar emphasis of position, compare "made complete," ver. 10, and "seated," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>.) Meyer and Alford, with the Vulgate, make "hidden" an attributive: "in whom are hidden treasures." Chrysostom and leading versions make it primary predicate: "in whom are hidden," etc., against the order of the words. This word also belongs to the dialect of the mystic theosophists (see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-3.htm">Isaiah 45:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/2-1.htm">Proverbs 2:1-11</a>).

Its position at the end of the sentence, and so far from are, shows that it is added as an emphatic secondary predicate. Hence, as Rev., in whom are all the treasures, etc., hidden. For a similar construction, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>, "where Christ is on the right hand of God seated (there)." <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>, "Every perfect gift is from above, coming down." Grammatically, hidden may be taken as an attribute of treasures; "in whom the hidden treasures are contained;" but the other is preferable. The words which immediately follow in <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-4.htm">Colossians 2:4</a>, suggest the possibility that hidden may convey an allusion to the Apocrypha or secret writings of the Essenes, whose doctrines entered into the Colossian heresy. Such writings, which, later, were peculiar also to the Gnostics, contained the authoritative secret wisdom, the esoteric teaching for the learned few. If such is Paul's allusion, the word suggests a contrast with the treasures of christian wisdom which are accessible to all in Christ.<p>Wisdom and knowledge<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>. </body></html>
