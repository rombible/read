The prize here (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm" title="Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may obtain.">1Corinthians 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm" title="I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.">Philippians 3:14</a>) is the heavenly reward of the Christian course. In St. Paul’s exhortation there seems to be a reference back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a>. There he says, “Let no man arrogate judgment over you;” here, “Let no man use that arrogated judgment so as to cheat you of your prize. There is one Judge, who has right and who is righteous; look to Him alone.”<p><span class= "bld">In a voluntary humility and worship.</span>—This rendering seems virtually correct, though other renderings are proposed. The original is, <span class= "ital">willing in humility and worship, </span>and the phrase “willing in” is often used in the LXX. for “delighting in.” Other translations are here possible, though not without some harshness. But the true sense is shown beyond all doubt to be that given in our version, by the words used below to describe the same process, “will-worship and humility.”<p>In this passage alone in the New Testament “humility “is spoken of with something of the condemnation accorded to it in heathen morality. The reason of this is obvious and instructive. Humility is a grace, of which the very essence is unconsciousness, and which, being itself negative, cannot live, except by resting on some more positive quality, such as faith or love. Whenever it is consciously cultivated and “delighted in, ”it loses all its grace; it becomes either unreal, “the pride that apes humility,” or it turns to abject slavishness and meanness. Of such depravations Church history is unhappily full.<p><span class= "bld">Worshipping of angels.</span>—This is closely connected with the “voluntary humility” above. The link of connection is supplied by the notice in the ancient interpreters, of the early growth of that unhappy idea, which has always lain at the root of saint-worship and angel-worship in the Church—“that we must be brought near by angels and not by Christ, for that were too high a thing for us” (Chrysostom). With this passage it is obvious to connect the emphasis laid (in Hebrews 1, 2) on the absolute superiority of our Lord to all angels, who are but “ministering spirits, sent forth to minister to them who are heirs of salvation;” and the prohibition of angel-worship in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a>, “See thou do it not; for I am thy fellow-servant . . . worship God.”<p>It might seem strange that on the rigid monotheism <span class= "ital">of</span> Judaism this incongruous creature-worship should have been engrafted. But here also the link is easily supplied. The worship of the angels of which the Essenic system bore traces, was excused on the ground that the Law had been given through the “ministration of angels” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-53.htm" title="Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-19.htm" title="Why then serves the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.">Galatians 3:19</a>), and that the tutelary guardianship of angels had been revealed in the later prophecy. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/10-10.htm" title="And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.">Daniel 10:10-21</a>.) For this reason it was held that angels might be worshipped, probably with the same subtle distinctions between this and that kind of worship with which we are familiar in the ordinary pleas for the veneration of saints. It has been noticed that in the Council of Laodicea, held in the fourth century, several canons were passed against Judaising, and that in close connection with these it was forbidden “to leave the Church of God and go away to invoke angels”; and we are told by Theodoret (in the next century) that “oratories to St. Michael (the ‘prince’ of the Jewish people) were still to be seen.” The “angels” in this half-Jewish system held the same intermediate position between the Divine and the human which in the ordinary Gnostic theories was held by the less personal <span class= "ital">Æons, </span>or supposed emanations from the Godhead.<p><span class= "bld">Intruding into those things which he hath not seen.</span>—(1) There is a remarkable division here, both of MSS. and ancient versions and commentators, as to the insertion or omission of the negative. But the balance of MS. authority is against the negative, and certainly it is easier to suppose it to have been inserted with a view to make an easier sense, than to have been omitted if it had been originally there. (2) The general meaning, however, of the passage is tolerably clear, and, curiously enough, little affected by either alternative. It certainly refers to pretensions to supernatural knowledge by which (just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>) the mind is said to be “puffed up.” We note that, even in true visions of heavenly things, there was danger lest the mind “should be exalted above measure” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>). Now the knowledge here pretended to is that favourite knowledge, claimed by Jewish and Christian mystics, of the secrets of the heavenly places and especially of the grades and functions of the hierarchy of heaven. St. Paul brands it as belonging to the mind, not of the spirit, but “of the flesh;” for indeed it was really superstitions, resting not on faith, but on supposed visions and supernatural manifestations. It “intruded” (or, according to another rendering, it “took its stand”) upon the secrets of a region which it said that it “had seen,” but which, in truth, it “had not seen.” If we omit the negative, the Apostle is quoting its claims; if we insert it, he is denying their justice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/colossians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,...">Colossians 2:18-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let no man beguile you of your reward </span>— Of future glory, however eagerly or artfully he may attempt it. According to Pierce, who pleads the authority of Demosthenes, the word <span class="greekheb">καταβραβευετω</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">beguile you of your reward, </span>should be translated <span class="ital">condemn you: </span>others, because the verb <span class="greekheb">βραβευω</span>, without the preposition, is translated <span class="ital">to rule, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm" title=" And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be you thankful.">Colossians 3:15</a>,) are of opinion that the expression may be translated <span class="ital">enslave you. </span>But as the original word comes from <span class="greekheb">βραβειον</span>, <span class="ital">a reward, </span>the compounded verb certainly more properly signifies to hinder a reward from being bestowed, an evil which the worshipping of angels, here guarded against, as more powerful mediators than Christ, would have occasioned. For if on any pretence these Colossian believers had forsaken Christ, and attached themselves to angels, they must have lost the whole benefit of Christ’s mediation. <span class="ital">In a voluntary humility </span>— <span class="greekheb">Θελων εν ταπεινοφροσυνη</span>, an expression which Whitby renders, <span class="ital">pleasing himself in his humility; </span>or <span class="ital">affecting humility, </span>and so not addressing God immediately, but only by the mediation of angels. In proof of which interpretation, the same author refers to several passages of the LXX., in which the word <span class="greekheb">θελω </span>means <span class="ital">to be pleased with, </span>or <span class="ital">to delight in, </span>a person or thing: there are also passages in the New Testament in which the word seems to bear the same meaning. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/20-26.htm" title="But it shall not be so among you: but whoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;...">Matthew 20:26-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-38.htm" title="And he said to them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,">Mark 12:38</a>. <span class="ital">And worshipping of angels </span>— It evidently appears, from several passages in Philo, to have been the opinion of that learned Jew, that angels were messengers who presented our prayers to God, as well as brought down his favours to us. He represents this view of the matter as most humble and reverential, and there is no doubt but it prevailed among other Jews. See <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/11-14.htm" title="And he wept, and said, Blessed art thou, O God, and blessed is thy name for ever; and blessed are all thine holy angels:">Tob 11:14</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/12-12.htm" title="Now therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter in law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee likewise.">Tob 12:12</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/12-15.htm" title="I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the glory of the Holy One.">Tob 12:15</a>. It was undoubtedly because the Jews entertained so great a respect for angels, on account of their supposed agency in human affairs, that the apostle, in this epistle, and in that to the Hebrews, took so much pains to show that the Son of God is greater than all angels. It is justly remarked by Bishop Burnet, that had it been the apostle’s intention to give the least encouragement to any religious addresses to saints and angels, this would have been a very natural occasion of introducing the subject, and adjusting its proper boundaries. <span class="ital">Intruding into things which he hath not seen </span>— With great presumption, and pretending to discover wonderful secrets, relating to their various ranks, subordinations, and offices. “The apostle’s meaning,” says Macknight, “is, that the false teachers, of whom he speaks, presumptuously penetrated into the secrets of the invisible world, and talked of them with an air of certainty, without having any knowledge of the things which they affirmed; particularly that the angels intercede with God for men, and that to worship them is acceptable to God.” <span class="ital">Vainly puffed up by his fleshly </span>— His corrupt and carnal; <span class="ital">mind — </span>With the conceit of things which it is impossible he should understand, and a desire of introducing novelties into religion. <span class="ital">And not holding the Head </span>— Not adhering to, and relying on Christ, the Head of his church, by whom all the true members of it are not only guided and governed, but <span class="ital">from whom, having </span>spiritual <span class="ital">nourishment ministered by joints and bands </span>— By various means of instruction and grace, or by the several talents and gifts of its members, employed for the good of the whole; <span class="ital">and knit together </span>— By love and mutual sympathy; <span class="ital">increaseth </span>— In knowledge, holiness, strength, stability, and usefulness; <span class="ital">with the increase of God </span>— That increase which comes from him, is approved by him, and tends to his glory. What the apostle here says against the worshipping of angels, concludes equally against the worshipping of saints. Indeed, it is absurd to suppose that any being can be a proper object of worship, which is not both omniscient and omnipresent, which certainly neither angels nor saints are. It is a just remark of a judicious divine, that the apostle’s exhortation in this verse is a good caution to us to beware of all refinements in Christianity, which have any tendency to derogate from the authority, office, and honour of Christ, as Head of the church.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:18-23 It looked like humility to apply to angels, as if men were conscious of their unworthiness to speak directly to God. But it is not warrantable; it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it to a creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those who worship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, to use any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is a growing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of the world. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel; in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church. Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommon spirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not in any honour to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy the carnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness, and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them so much as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul no good, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh. What the Lord has left indifferent, let us regard as such, and leave others to the like freedom; and remembering the passing nature of earthly things, let us seek to glorify God in the use of them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let no man beguile you of your reward - Margin, judge against you. The word used here - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;  katabrabeuo&#772; - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It is a word which was employed with reference to the distribution of prizes at the Grecian games, and means, to give the prize against anyone, to deprive of the palm. Hence, it means to deprive of a due reward: and the sense here is, that they were to be on their guard lest the "reward" - the crown of victory to which they looked forward - should be wrested from them by the arts of others. That would be done if they should be persuaded to turn back, or to falter in the race. The only way to secure the prize was to hold on in the race which they then were running; but if they yielded to the philosophy of the Greeks, and the teachings of the Jews, they would be defrauded of this reward as certainly as a racer at the games would if the crown of victory should be unjustly awarded to another. In this case, too, as real injustice would be done, though the apostle does not say it would be in the same manner. Here it would be by art; in the case of the racer it would be by a wrong decision - but in either case the crown was lost. This exhortation has the more force from this consideration. Against an unjust judge we could have no power; but we may take care that the reward be not wrested from us by fraud.<p>In a voluntary humility - Margin," being a voluntary in humility." Tyndale renders this," Let no man make you shoot at a wrong mark, which, after his own imagination, walketh in the humbleness of angels." The word used here (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  tapeinophrosune&#772;) means "lowliness of mind, modesty, humbleness of deportment;" and the apostle refers, doubtless, to the spirit assumed by those against whom he would guard the Colossians - the spirit of modesty or of humble inquirers. The meaning is, that they would not announce their opinions with dogmatic certainty, but they would put on the appearance of great modesty. In this way, they would become really more dangerous - for no false teachers are so dangerous as those who assume the aspect of great humility, and who manifest great reverence for divine things. The word rendered "voluntary" here - &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  thelo&#772;n - does not, properly, belong to the word rendered "humility." It rather appertains to the subsequent part of the sentence, and means that the persons referred to were willing, or had pleasure in attempting, to search into the hidden and abstruse things of religion. They were desirous of appearing to do this with an humble spirit - even with the modesty of an angel - but still they had pleasure in that profound and dangerous kind of inquiry.<p>And worshipping of angels - &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  thre&#772;skeia to&#772;n angelo&#772;n. This does not mean, as it seems to me, that they would themselves worship angels or that they would teach others to do it for there is no reason to believe this. Certainly the Jewish teachers, whom the apostle seems to have had particularly in his eye, would not do it; nor is there any evidence that any class of false teachers would deliberately teach that angels were to be worshipped The reference is rather to the profound reverence; the spirit of lowly piety which the angels evinced, and to the fact that the teachers referred to would assume the same spirit, and were, therefore, the more dangerous. They would come professing profound regard for the great mysteries of religion, and for the incomprehensible perfections of the divinity, and would approach the subject professedly with the awful veneration which the angels have when they "look into these things;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>. There was no bold, irreverent, or confident declamation, but the danger in the case arose from the fact that they assumed so much the aspect of modest piety; so much the appearance of the lowly devotion of angelic beings. The word rendered here "worship" - &#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  thre&#772;skeia - occurs in the New Testament only here, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a>; and <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26-27</a>, in each of which places it is rendered "religion." It means here the religion, or the spirit of humble reverence and devotion which is evinced by the angels; and this accords well with the meaning in <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26-27</a>.<p>Intruding into those things which he hath not seen - Or inquiring into them. The word used here (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  embateuo&#772;n) means to go in, or enter; then to investigate, to inquire. It has not, properly, the meaning of intruding, or of impertinent inquiry (see Passow), and I do not see that the apostle meant to characterize the inquiry here as such. He says that it was the object of their investigations to look, with great professed modesty and reverence, into those things which are not visible to the eye of mortals. The "things" which seem here to be particularly referred to, are the abstruse questions respecting the mode of the divine subsistence; the ranks, orders, and employments of angelic beings; and the obscure doctrines relating to the divine government and plans. These questions comprised most of the subjects of inquiry in the Oriental and Grecian philosophy, and inquiries on these the apostle apprehended would tend to draw away the mind from the "simplicity that is in Christ." Of these subjects what can be known more than is revealed?<p>Vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind - Notwithstanding the avowed "humility," the modesty, the angelic reverence, yet the mind was full of vain conceit, and self-confident, carnal wisdom. The two things are by no means incompatible - the men apparently most meek and modest being sometimes the most bold in their speculations, and the most reckless in regard to the great landmarks of truth. It is not so with true modesty, and real "angelic veneration," but all this is sometimes assumed for the purpose of deceiving; and sometimes there is a native appearance of modesty which is by no means an index of the true feelings of the soul. The most meek and modest men in appearance are sometimes the most proud and reckless in their investigations of the doctrines of religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. beguile&#8212;Translate, "Defraud you of your prize," literally, "to adjudge a prize out of hostility away from him who deserves it" [Trench]. "To be umpire in a contest to the detriment of one." This defrauding of their prize the Colossians would suffer, by letting any self-constituted arbitrator or judge (that is, false teacher) draw them away from Christ," the righteous Judge" and Awarder of the prize (2Ti 4:8; Jas 1:12; 1Pe 5:4), to angel-worship.<p>in a voluntary humility&#8212;So "will-worship" (Col 2:23). Literally, "Delighting ([Wahl]) in humility"; loving (so the Greek is translated, Mr 12:38, "love to go in long clothing") to indulge himself in a humility of his own imposing: a volunteer in humility [Dall&aelig;us]. Not as Alford, "Let no one of purpose defraud you," &c. Not as Grotius, "If he ever so much wish" (to defraud you). For the participle "wishing" or "delighting," is one of the series, and stands in the same category as "intruding," "puffed up," "not holding"; and the self-pleasing implied in it stands in happy contrast to the (mock) humility with which it seems to me, therefore, to be connected. His "humility," so called, is a pleasing of self: thus it stands in parallelism to "his fleshly mind" (its real name, though he styles it "humility"), as "wishing" or "delighting" does to "puffed up." The Greek for "humility" is literally, "lowliness of mind," which forms a clearer parallel to "puffed up by his fleshly mind." Under pretext of humility, as if they durst not come directly to God and Christ (like the modern Church of Rome), they invoked angels: as Judaizers, they justified this on the ground that the law was given by angels. This error continued long in Phrygia (where Colosse and Laodicea were), so that the Council of Laodicea (A.D. 360) expressly framed its thirty-fifth canon against the "Angelici" (as Augustine [Heresies, 39], calls them) or "invokers of angels." Even as late as Theodoret's time, there were oratories to Michael the archangel. The modern Greeks have a legend that Michael opened a chasm to draw off an inundation threatening the Colossian Christians. Once men admit the inferior powers to share invocation with the Supreme, the former gradually engrosses all our serious worship, almost to the exclusion of the latter; thus the heathen, beginning with adding the worship of other deities to that of the Supreme, ended with ceasing to worship Him at all. Nor does it signify much, whether we regard such as directly controlling us (the pagan view), or as only influencing the Supreme in our behalf (the Church of Rome's view); because he from whom I expect happiness or misery, becomes the uppermost object in my mind, whether he give, or only procure it [Cautions for Times]. Scripture opposes the idea of "patrons" or "intercessors" (1Ti 2:5, 6). True Christian humility joins consciousness of utter personal demerit, with a sense of participation in the divine life through Christ, and in the dignity of our adoption by God. Without the latter being realized, a false self-humiliation results, which displays itself in ceremonies and ascetic self-abasement (Col 2:23), which after all is but spiritual pride under the mock guise of humility. Contrast "glorying in the Lord" (1Co 1:31).<p>intruding into &#8230; things which he hath not seen&#8212;So very old manuscripts and Vulgate and Origen read. But the oldest manuscripts and Lucifer omit "not"; then translate, "haughtily treading on ('Standing on' [Alford]) the things which he hath seen." Tregelles refers this to fancied visions of angels. But if Paul had meant a fancied seeing, he would have used some qualifying word, as, "which he seemed to see," not "which he hath seen." Plainly the things were actually seen by him, whether of demoniacal origination (1Sa 28:11-20), or phenomena resulting from natural causation, mistaken by him as if supernatural. Paul, not stopping to discuss the nature of the things so seen, fixes on the radical error, the tendency of such a one in all this to walk by SENSE (namely, what he haughtily prides himself on having SEEN), rather than by FAITH in the UNSEEN "Head" (Col 2:19; compare Joh 20:29; 2Co 5:7; Heb 11:1). Thus is the parallelism, "vainly puffed up" answers to "haughtily treading on," or "setting his foot on"; "his fleshly mind" answers to the things which he hath seen," since his fleshliness betrays itself in priding himself on what he hath seen, rather than on the unseen objects of faith. That the things seen may have been of demoniacal origination, appears from 1Ti 4:1, "Some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils" (Greek, "demons").

The apostle labours to fortify the true followers of Christ against such superstitious subtle ones, who by their artifice did assume a magisterial authority (without any sure warrant from God) to impose their traditionary and invented services upon them, and determine of their state, accordingly as the papists do at this day. One learned man thinks the apostle had not used this word here, but for some notable advantage, viz. because the simple word may signify to intercede as well as to judge; it made wonderfully to his purpose in this composition, (as he uses <span class="ital">concision, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2</a></span>), to disparage those seducers who did, from some notions of the Platonists, labour to gain credit to that opinion that the angels were intercessors between God and man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In a voluntary humility, and worshipping of angels; </span> covering their imperious spirit by being volunteers in humility, or by a pretence of voluntary, uncommanded humility, alleging it would be presumption in them to address themselves immediately to God, and therefore they would pay a religious homage to angels, as of a middle nature between God and them, presuming they would mediate for them: an instance to express all that invented worship, which, how specious soever it may seem to be, hath no warrant from Christ, who alone can procure acceptance of our persons and services. He expects that his disciples should assert his rights, and the liberty with which he hath made them free, against the traditions of self-willed men, and no more to solemnize for worship, than teach for doctrines, the traditions of men, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-2.htm" title="Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.">Matthew 15:2</a>,6,9</span>.

The apostle useth a Platonic word against those who did indulge themselves out of curiosity in the opinions of the Platonists about angels, the worshippers of which, amongst those who were professed Christians in Phrygia, were so tenacious of their error that they were not rooted out after the third century, when a canon was made against them under the name of Angelici, in the council of Laodicea near Colosse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind; </span> the first rise of such foolish presumption, was a being rashly puffed up with the sense of their flesh, a deluded mind moved by some carnal principle, setting out things with swelling words of vanity, wherewith in truth they have no acquaintance, and whereof they have no experience, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-7.htm" title="Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.">1 Timothy 1:7</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/colossians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let no man beguile you of your reward,.... Or prize; the allusion is to the Olympic games, one of which was running races; in which the stadium, or race plot was fixed, a mark set up to look and run unto, a corruptible crown proposed to be run for, and which was held by one who sat as judge, and determined who got the victory, and to whom the crown belonged; these judges sometimes acted the unfair part, and defrauded the victors of their proper right, and to such the apostle compares the false teachers: the Christian's reward, or prize he is running for, is the incorruptible and never fading crown of glory, life, and righteousness; the race plot is the Christian life, spent in the exercise of grace, and discharge of duty, and in holding fast, and holding out in a profession of faith unto the end; the mark he looks at, and presses towards, is Jesus Christ; and his great concern, the apostle by this metaphor suggests should be, lest by false teachers he should be defrauded of the prize of the high calling of God, through their removing the mark Christ from him, by denying his person and Godhead; or by intercepting his sight of him, placing other objects before him, such as angels, to be worshipped and adored; or by darkening of it, joining Moses and Christ, law and Gospel, works and grace together, in the business of salvation; whereby he might seem to come short, or be in danger of coming short of the heavenly glory: <p>in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels; these things the apostle instances in, as in what lay their danger of being beguiled of their reward, or prize. True humility is an excellent grace; it is the clothing and ornament of a Christian; nor is there anything that makes a man more like Christ, than this grace; but in these men here respected, it was only the appearance of humility, it was not real; it was in things they devised and willed, not in things which God commanded, Christ required, or the Scriptures pointed at; they would have been thought to have been very lowly and humble, and to have a great consciousness of their own vileness and unworthiness to draw nigh to Christ the Mediator immediately, and by him to God; wherefore in pretence of great humility, they proposed to make use of angels as mediators with Christ; whereby Christ, the only Mediator between God and man, would be removed out of sight and use; and that humble boldness and holy confidence with God at the throne of grace, through Christ, which believers are allowed to use, would be discouraged and destroyed, and the saints be in danger as to the outward view of things, and in all human appearance of losing their reward: "worshipping of angels" was a practice which very early prevailed among some that were called Christians, and for a long time continued in Phrygia and Pisidia; some make Simon Magus, and others Cerinthus, the author of this idolatry; but was not only a branch of the Platonic philosophy, and so a part of that philosophy and vain deceit before mentioned, <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, which these men might have borrowed from the Gentiles, but was a notion and practice of the Jews: before the Babylonish captivity, the names of angels were not known, nor are they ever mentioned by name in Scripture; hence they say (s), that "the names of angels came up with them, or by their means from Babylon: <p>after this they began to talk much of them, and to have too high a veneration for them, and ascribe too much to them; and observing that the law was ordained, spoken, and given by them, and that the administration of things under the former dispensation was greatly by their means, they fell to worshipping of them (t); and the believing Jews were hereby in great danger of falling into the same practice: hence the author of the epistle to the Hebrews, writing to the Jewish church, largely insists on the proof of Christ being superior to angels; showing that he has a more excellent name than they had; that he was the Son of God in such sense as they were not the sons of God; that they were worshippers of him, yea, that they were creatures made by him, and even ministering spirits to his saints, the heirs of salvation: and very rightly, is worshipping of angels condemned here by the apostle, since God only is the object of worship; since these are creatures, and so not to be adored; are worshippers of God and Christ themselves, and have refused adoration when it has been offered to them: that the Jews did, and do worship angels, and make use of them as mediators and intercessors, is clear from their liturgy, or prayer books, where they say (u). <p>", "O ye angels of mercies", or ye merciful angels, ministers of the most High, entreat now the face of God for good: <p>and elsewhere (w), <p>"they say three times, let Juhach keep us, let Juhach deliver us, and let Juhach help us: <p>now Juhach was the name of an angel, who they supposed had the care of men, and is taken from the final letters of those words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, "for he shall give his angels charge over thee": so they speak of an angel whom they call Sandalphon, who they say is appointed over the prayers of the righteous (x): with this notion the judaizing and false teachers seem to have been tinctured, and against which the apostle here cautions the saints, lest, under a show of humility, they should be drawn into it: and to preserve them from it, he observes, that such an one who should spread and propagate such a notion, was one that was <p>intruding into those things which he hath not seen; thrusting himself in a bold and daring manner into an inquiry and search after, debate upon, and affirmation of things he could have no certain knowledge of; as of angels, whose nature, qualities, works, and ministrations, he had never seen with his bodily eyes; nor could ever discern with the eyes of his understanding any such things in the Scriptures, which he ascribed to them; but they were the birth of his own mind, the fruits of his own fancy and imagination, things devised in his own brain: being <p>vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind; judging of things not according to the word of God, and with a spiritual judgment, and according to a spiritual sense and experience, but according to his own carnal reason, and the vanity of his mind; being puffed and swelled with an high opinion of himself, of his great parts and abilities, of his knowledge of things above others, and of his capacity to penetrate into, and find out things which were not seen and known by others: this shows that his humility was forced, and only in outward appearance, and was not true and genuine, <p>(s) T.

Even Tittmann, <span class="ital">Synon</span>. p. 131, comes at length to such an <span class="ital">ultro</span>, erroneously quoting Herod, 9:14, where <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΈΛΩΝ</span></span></span> must be taken as in Plat. <span class="ital">Theaet. l.c.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ταπεινοφρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θρησκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἀγγέλ</span>.] <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is not <span class="ital">propter</span>, which is supposed to have the meaning: because <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΑΠΕΙΝΟΦΡ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is necessary to salvation (Reiche); nor does it denote the <span class="ital">condition</span> in which the <span class="greekheb">καταβραβεύειν</span> takes place (Steiger, Huther); but, in keeping with the <span class="greekheb">θέλων</span>, it is the <span class="ital">means</span> by which the purpose is to be <span class="ital">attained: by virtue of humility and worshipping of angels</span>. Thereby he wishes to effect that the <span class="greekheb">βραβεῖον</span> shall be withdrawn from you (and given to himself and his followers). <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλέλων</span> is the genitive of the <span class="ital">object</span> (comp. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/14-27.htm" title="For the worshipping of idols not to be named is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.">Wis 14:27</a>; Herodian, iv. 8. 17; Clem. <span class="ital">Cor</span>.

That the latter, however, is not humility in the <span class="ital">proper</span> sense, but is, viewed from the perverse personal standpoint of the false teachers, a humility in <span class="ital">their</span> sense only, is plain from the context (see below, <span class="greekheb">εἰκῆ φυσιούμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), although <span class="ital">irony</span> (Steiger, Huther) is not to be found in the word. Paul, namely, designates the thing as that, for which the false teachers held it themselves and desired it to be held by others, and this, indeed, as respects the disposition lying at the root of it, which they sought to exhibit (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΤΑΠΕΙΝΟΦΡ</span></span></span>.), and as respects the abnormal religious phenomenon manifested among them (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΡΗΣΚ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΓΓΈΛΩΝ</span></span></span>); and then proceeds to give a deterrent exposure of both of these together according to their true character in a theoretical (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ἃ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἘΜΒΑΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>) and in a moral (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸΚῆ ΦΥΣ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ΤῊΝ ΚΕΦΑΛῊΝ</span></span></span>) respect. <span class="ital">How far</span> the false teachers bore themselves as <span class="greekheb">ταπεινόφρονες</span>, is correctly defined by Theodoret: <span class="greekheb">λέγοντες</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἀόρατος ὁ τῶν ὅλων Θεὸς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀνέφικτος τε καὶ ἀκατάληπτος</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ προσήκει διὰ τῶν ἀγγέλων τὴν θείαν εὐμένειαν πραγματεύεσθαι</span>, so that they thus regarded man as too insignificant <span class="ital">in the presence of the divine majesty</span> to be able to do without[121] the mediation of angels, which they sought to secure through <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span> (comp. 4Ma 4:11), thereby placing the merit of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a>) in the background. It is differently explained by Chrysostom and Theophylact (comp. also Photius in Oecumenius): the false teachers had declared the <span class="ital">majesty of the Only-Begotten</span> to be too exalted for lowly humanity to have access through Him to the Father, and hence the need of the mediation of angels for that purpose. In opposition to this view it may be urged, that the very prominence so frequently and intentionally given to the majesty of Christ in our Epistle, and especially as above the angels, rather goes to show that they had <span class="ital">depreciated</span> the dignity of Christ. Reiche and Ewald (comp. Hofmann’s interpretation below) find the <span class="greekheb">ταπεινοφροσύνη</span> in the <span class="greekheb">ἀφειδία σώματος</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm" title=" Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.">Colossians 2:23</a>, where, however, the two aberrations are adduced <span class="ital">separately</span> from one another, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm" title=" Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.">Colossians 2:23</a>. Proofs of the existence of the <span class="ital">worship of angels</span> in the post-apostolic <span class="ital">church</span> are found in Justin, <span class="ital">Ap</span>. I. 6, p. 56,[122] Athenagoras, and others; among the <span class="ital">Gnostic heretics</span> (Simonians, Cainites): Epiph. <span class="ital">Haer</span>. xx. 2; Tertullian, <span class="ital">praescr</span>. 33; Iren. <span class="ital">Haer</span>. i. 31. 2; and with respect to the worshipping of angels in the <span class="ital">Colossian</span> region Theodoret testifies: <span class="greekheb">ἔμεινε δὲ τοῦτο τὸ πάθος ἐν τῇ Φρυγίᾳ καὶ Πισιδίᾳ μέχρι πολλοῦ</span>· <span class="greekheb">οὗ δὴ χάριν καὶ συνελθοῦσα σύνοδος ἐν Λαοδικείᾳ τῆς Φρυγίας</span> (A.D. 364, can. 35) <span class="greekheb">νόμῳ κεκώλυκε τὸ τοῖς ἀγγέλοις προσεύχεσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ μέχρι δὲ τοῦ νῦν εὐκτήρια τοῦ ἁγίου Μιχαὴλ παρʼ ἐκείνοις καὶ τοῖς ὁμόροις ἐκείνων ἐστὶν ἰδεῖν</span>. The <span class="ital">Catholic expedients for evading</span> the prohibition of angel-worship in our passage (as also in the <span class="ital">Concil. Laod</span>., Mansi, II. p. 568) may be seen especially in Cornelius a Lapide, who understands not all angel-worship, but only that which places the angels above Christ (comp. also Bisping), and who refers the Laodicean prohibition pointing to a “<span class="greekheb">κεκρυμμένη εἰδδωλολαατρεία</span> (“<span class="greekheb">ὃτι οὐ δεῖ Χριστιανοὺς ἐγκαταλείπειν τὴν ἐκκλησίαν τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ ἀπιέναι καὶ ἁγγέλους ὀνομάζειν</span>” <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.), in accordance with the second Nicene Council, only to the cultus <span class="ital">latriae</span>, not <span class="ital">duliae</span>, consequently to actual adoration, not <span class="greekheb">τιμητικὴν προσκύνησιν</span>. In opposition to the words as they stand (for <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span> with the genitive of the subject would necessarily be the cultus, which the angels present to God, 4Ma 5:6; 4Ma 5:12; Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt</span>. xii. 5. 4; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm" title="Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most strait sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.">Acts 26:5</a>), and also in opposition to the context (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>), several have taken <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἀγγέλων</span> as the genitive <span class="ital">of the subject</span>, and have explained it of a religious condition, which desired to be like that of the angels, <span class="ital">e.g</span>. Luther: “<span class="ital">spirituality of the angels,</span>” comp. Melanchthon, Schoettgen (“habitus aliquis angelicus”), Wolf, Dalmer. Nevertheless, Hofmann, attempting a more subtle definition of the sense, has again taken <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἀγγέλων</span> as genitive of the <span class="ital">subject</span>, and joined with it not only <span class="greekheb">θρησκείᾳ</span>, but also <span class="greekheb">ταπεινοφροσύνῃ</span>. The <span class="greekheb">ταπεινοφροσύνη</span> of the angels, namely, consists in <span class="ital">their willingly keeping within the bounds assigned to them as spirits</span>, and not coveting that which <span class="ital">man</span> in this respect <span class="ital">has beyond them</span>, namely, what belongs to the <span class="ital">corporeal</span> world. And the <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span> of the angels is <span class="ital">a self-devotion to God</span>, in which, between them and Him, <span class="ital">no other barrier</span> exists than <span class="ital">that between the Creator and His creatures</span>. That <span class="greekheb">ταπεινοφροσύνη</span> and this <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span> man makes into <span class="ital">virtue</span> on his part, when he, although but partially, <span class="ital">renounces that which belongs to Him in distinction from the angels</span> (<span class="greekheb">ταπεινοφρ</span>.), and, as one <span class="ital">who has divested himself as much as possible of his corporeality</span>, presents himself <span class="ital">adoringly</span> to God in such measure as he <span class="ital">refrains</span> from what was conferred upon him for <span class="ital">bodily</span> enjoyment. I do not comprehend how, on the one hand, the apostle could wrap up the combinations of ideas imputed to him in words so enigmatical, nor, on the other, how the readers could, without the guidance of Hofmann, extract them out of these words. The entire exposition is a labyrinth of imported subjective fancies. Paul might at least have written <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐγκρατείᾳ ἐπὶ τῷ ὁμοιώματι</span> (or <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ὁμοίωσιν</span>, or <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ὁμοιότητα</span>) <span class="greekheb">τῆς ταπεινοφροσύνης καὶ θρησκείας τῶν ἀγγέλων</span>! Even this would still have been far enough from clear, but it would at least have contained the point and a hint as to its interpretation. See, besides, in opposition to Hofmann, Rich.

This reference must have been intelligible to the readers from the assertions put forth by the false teachers,[125] but the failure to observe it induced copyists, at a very early date, to add a negative (sometimes <span class="greekheb">μή</span> and sometimes <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span>) before <span class="greekheb">ἑώρακεν</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐμβατεύειν</span> (only used here in the N.

II. 332; Bloomfield, <span class="ital">Gloss. in Aesch. Pers</span>. p. 146 f.). So Budaeus and Calvin (<span class="ital">se ingerens</span>), both with the reading <span class="greekheb">μή</span>, also Huther (<span class="ital">establishing himself firmly</span> in the creations of fancy); still the context does not suggest this, and, when used in this sense, <span class="greekheb">ἐμβατ</span>. is usually coupled with <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> (Dem. 894. 7, 1085. 24, 1086. 19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-3.htm" title="You have multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy: they joy before you according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.">Isaiah 9:3</a>, <span class="ital">et al.;</span> <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>. This verse gives us our only definite information, apart from which it would have been a highly probable inference, that the false teachers practised angel-worship.—<span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς καταβραβευέτω</span>. This is commonly translated “rob you of your prize”. The judge at the games was called <span class="greekheb">βραβεύς</span> or <span class="greekheb">βραβευτής</span>, and the prize <span class="greekheb">βραβεῖον</span>. But the verb <span class="greekheb">βραβεύω</span> apparently lost all reference to the prize, and meant simply “to decide”. In the two cases in which <span class="greekheb">καταβραβεύω</span> occurs it means to decide against or condemn. It is best therefore to take it so here, “let no one give judgment against you”; it is thus parallel to, though stronger than, <span class="greekheb">κρινέτω</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a>). (Field, <span class="ital">Notes on Transl. of the N.T.</span>, pp. 196, 197, discusses the word; <span class="ital">cf.</span> also Ol. and Abb. <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>)—<span class="greekheb">θέλων ἐν ταπεινοφροσύνῃ</span>. This phrase is very variously interpreted. Some assume a Hebraism, and translate “taking pleasure in humility” (Winer, Lightf., Findl., Haupt). The LXX uses this not infrequently (but usually with persons, though otherwise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-1.htm" title="Praise you the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.">Psalm 111:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-10.htm" title="The LORD shall reign for ever, even your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise you the LORD.">Psalm 146:10</a>); but there is no N.T. parallel for it, and Paul does not employ Hebraisms. For this idea he uses <span class="greekheb">εὐδοκεῖν</span>. Moreover it yields no relevant sense here. Others translate “wishing to do so in (<span class="ital">or</span> by) humility” (Mey., Ell., Sod., Weiss). But for this <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο ποιεῖν</span> should have been added, and on this interpretation <span class="greekheb">θέλων</span> has really little point. The rendering of Alford, Moule and others is not very different from this in sense, but more forcible. It connects <span class="greekheb">θέλ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">καταβραβ</span>., and translates “wilfully,” “of set purpose”. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-5.htm" title="For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:">2 Peter 3:5</a> is referred to for the construction. Oltramare’s view is similar, but he translates “spontaneously,” so apparently the R.V. mg. and Abbott. The unsatisfactoriness of these interpretations suggests that the text may be corrupt. Hort thinks that for <span class="greekheb">θέλων ἐν ταπεινοφροσύνῃ</span> we should read <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐθελοταπεινοφροσύνῃ</span>. This word is used by Basil, and a similar compound occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm" title=" Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.">Colossians 2:23</a>. It is, of course, as Haupt says, difficult to understand how the copyists should have altered it into the very strange expression in the text. But this is not a fatal objection, and the conjecture is very possibly correct. It would mean “gratuitous humility,” a humility that went beyond what was required. <span class="greekheb">ταπεινοφροσύνῃ</span> is frequently explained as ironical. By a display of humility they beguiled their dupes. But the connexion with the following words makes this improbable. Their humility found an expression in angel worship. It is therefore that lowliness which causes a man to think himself unworthy to come into fellowship with God, and therefore prompts to worship of the angels. Such humility was perverted, but not therefore unreal. It was compatible with vanity towards others.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ θρησκείᾳ τῶν ἀγγέλων</span>: “and worship of angels”. The genitive is objective, though some have taken it as subjective. This has been done most recently and elaborately by Zahn. He takes <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγγ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">ταπειν</span>. as well as with <span class="greekheb">θρησκείᾳ</span>. The former noun is used, he argues, in a non-Pauline sense, therefore it needs a definition, and that <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγγ</span>. is intended to define it is made probable by the fact that it is not repeated before <span class="greekheb">θρησκ</span>. What is meant is a mortification and devotion suitable for angels, but not for men who live in bodies, an attempt to assimilate themselves to angels, who do not eat or drink. The chief ground urged for this view is that Judaism was too strenuously monotheistic to admit of angel worship, and Paul could only have regarded it as idolatry. Against this what is said in the <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, section ii., may be referred to. The angels worshipped by the false teachers are the <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖα τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κόσμου</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀρχαὶ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξουσίαι</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἃ ἑόρακεν ἐμβατεύων</span>. If <span class="greekheb">μὴ</span> is inserted after <span class="greekheb">ἃ</span>, we may translate with Ellicott, in his earlier editions, “intruding into the things which he hath not seen”. This should probably be explained with reference to the invisible world, with which they professed to hold communion, but which really was closed to them. Ellicott still thinks this reading gives the better sense, though adopting the other in deference to the external evidence. But Paul could hardly have brought it against them that they had fellowship with what they could not see. For this was so with all who walked by faith. The negative, therefore, is not helpful to the sense, and is definitely excluded by the external evidence. The text without the negative is very variously explained. <span class="greekheb">ἐμβατεύειν</span> means “to stand upon,” then “to come into possession of” a thing, “to enter upon,” “to invade,” then in a figurative sense “to investigate”. Since <span class="greekheb">ἃ ἑόρακεν</span> also lends itself to diametrically opposite interpretations, the exegesis becomes doubly uncertain. It may mean the things which can be seen with the bodily eye, or it may refer to visions; they may be condemned as deluded visionaries, or for their materialism. Alford and Ellicott translate “taking his stand on the things which he hath seen,” and explain that he becomes an inhabitant of the world of sight rather than of faith. But the use of the perfect is against any reference to the circumstances of ordinary life, and the thought would have been far more simply and clearly expressed by <span class="greekheb">τὰ ὁρατά</span>. Generally it is supposed that “the things which he has seen” means his visions. Various views are then taken of <span class="greekheb">ἐμβατεύων</span>. Meyer translates “entering upon what he has beheld,” and explains that, instead of holding fast to Christ, he enters the region of visions. Several translate “investigating” (Beng., Grimm, Findl., Ol., Haupt). This is probably the best translation of the words as they stand, for the translation “parading his visions” (Sod. and? Abb.) seems not to be well established. The harshness of the combination, and uncertainty of the exegesis, give much probability to the view that the text has not been correctly transmitted. After it had been conjectured that we should read <span class="greekheb">ἃ ἑώρα κενεμβατεύων</span>, Lightfoot independently suggested the latter word, but for <span class="greekheb">ἃ ἑώρα</span> suggested <span class="greekheb">ἐώρᾳ</span>. or <span class="greekheb">αἰώρᾳ</span>. [Sod. incorrectly quotes the emendation as <span class="greekheb">αἰῶρα</span>; and in Abb. by a misprint we have <span class="greekheb">αἰώρα</span>. Ellicott not only misreports Lightfoot’s emendation, but does not even mention Taylor’s.] <span class="greekheb">ἐώρα</span> is used sometimes of that which suspends a thing, sometimes of the act of suspension. “In this last sense,” Lightfoot says, “it describes the poising of a bird, the floating of a boat on the waters, the balancing on a rope, and the like. Hence its expressiveness when used as a metaphor.” <span class="greekheb">κενεμβατεύειν</span> does not actually occur, but the cognate verb <span class="greekheb">κενεμβατεῖν</span> is not uncommon. A much better emendation, however, is that of Dr. C. Taylor (<span class="ital">Journal of Philology</span>, vii., p. 130), <span class="greekheb">ἀέρα κενεμβατεύων</span>, “treading the void of air”. In his <span class="ital">Pirqe Aboth</span>,2 p. 161, he says that the Rabbinic expression “fly in the air with nothing to rest upon” may have suggested the phrase to Paul. This emendation is accepted by Westcott and Hort, and regarded as the most probable by Zahn, who says that the text as it stands yields no sense. It involves the omission of a single letter, and although the province of conjectural emendation in the New Testament is very restricted, yet such a slip as is suggested may very easily have been made by Paul’s amanuensis or a very early copyist. Field urges as a fatal objection that “<span class="greekheb">κενεμβατεύων</span> is a <span class="ital">vox nulla</span>, the inviolable laws regulating this class of composite verbs stamping <span class="greekheb">κενεμβατεῖν</span> as the only legitimate, as it is the only existing, form” (<span class="ital">loc. cit.</span>, p. 198). Lightfoot, on the contrary, asserts that it is unobjectionable in itself. Even if Field’s criticism be admitted, it would be better to read <span class="greekheb">ἀέρα κενεμβατῶν</span> than to retain the text. If the emendation is correct, Paul is asserting the baseless character of the false teaching; and all reference to visions disappears.—<span class="greekheb">εἰκῇ</span> should probably, in accordance with Pauline usage, be connected with the following rather than the preceding words. It may mean “groundlessly” (Mey., Alf., Ell., Ol., Haupt, Abb.) or “without result” (Sod. and others). The latter is the sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-4.htm" title="Have you suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.">Galatians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-11.htm" title="I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed on you labor in vain.">Galatians 4:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-2.htm" title="By which also you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain.">1 Corinthians 15:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm" title="For he is the minister of God to you for good.

They were puffed up by a sense of spiritual and intellectual superiority.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ τοῦ νοὸς τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ</span>: “by the mind of his flesh”. The mind in this case is regarded as dominated by the flesh. Soden, followed by Abbott, says that the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> as a natural faculty is ethically indifferent in itself, and so may stand just as well under the influence of <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> as of <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>. But in the most important passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-22.htm" title="For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:...">Romans 7:22-25</a>, it is the higher nature in the unregenerate which wages unsuccessful conflict with the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>.

The choice of the phrase here is probably dictated by Paul’s wish to drive home the fact that their asceticism and angel worship, so far from securing as they imagined the destruction of the flesh, proved that it was by the flesh that they were altogether controlled, even to the mind itself, which stood farthest from it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">Let no</span> man] Another parallel but distinct caution after that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">beguile you of your reward</span>] <span class="bld">Rob you of your prize</span>, R.V.

Geneva, “<span class="ital">Let no man … beare rule over you</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in a voluntary humility</span>] The Greek means, quite literally, “<span class="ital">willing in humility</span>”<span class="ital">;</span> and some questions arise about the construction. These may be reduced to two main alternatives, (<span class="ital">a</span>) Is “<span class="ital">willing</span>” to be connected with the verb just previous, and to be rendered, “let no one rob you of your prize <span class="ital">willingly,” “meaningly,” “of malice prepense”</span>? (<span class="ital">b</span>) Is “<span class="ital">willing</span>” to be connected with the words just following, and explained, “<span class="ital">taking pleasure in</span> humility”? Of these (<span class="ital">a</span>) is easier grammatically, but Ellicott urges the grave objection that it attributes a Satanic and almost incredible malice to the teachers in question. It may be answered that St Paul need not be charging them with “meaning” to rob their followers of heaven, but with “meaning” to rob them of a faith with which as a fact the hope of heaven was bound up. Lightfoot advocates (<span class="ital">b</span>), and proves that it is a construction supported by the LXX., where it is not used “only with personal pronouns” (as Ellicott says), but with ordinary nouns; see Psalms 110. (Heb. and Eng. 111.) 1, 146. (Heb. and Eng. 147.) 10. The strong Hebraism, without any N.T. parallel, is certainly startling, however; and we recommend (<span class="ital">a</span>), though doubtfully, with the explanation given above. The rendering would be somewhat thus, in paraphrase: <span class="bld">Let no man have his own way in robbing you</span> &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">humility</span>] “Humility is a vice with heathen moralists but a virtue with Christian Apostles.… In this passage which (with <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm" title=" Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.">Colossians 2:23</a>) forms the sole exception to the general language of the Apostles, the divergence is rather apparent than real” (Lightfoot). An artificial, gratuitous, humility is not humility but its parody. And such was the thing in question; an abasement of man before unlawful objects (see next words) of worship; a prostration self-chosen, and also self-conscious.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">worshipping of angels</span>] A practice highly developed in later Judaism, while entirely absent from the apostolic teaching, and indeed clearly condemned here, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said to me, See you do it not: I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a>, and implicitly in Hebrews 1—It is noticeable that the Council of Laodicea (a.d. 394), so near Colossæ, forbids (c. 35) Christians to leave the Church and go away “to name angels” in secret assemblies, calling this a “secret idolatry,” and apparently connecting it with Jewish influences. Theodoret in his Commentary here speaks of the existence in his time (cent. 5) of Oratories (<span class="ital">euctêria</span>) to the Archangel Michael in the region of Laodicea and Colossæ, and of their popularity, apparently as rivals to the regular Churches. At this day in Abyssinia Michael has his holyday <span class="ital">every month</span>.—See further <span class="ital">Introd</span>., pp. 15, 31, 33.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Angels,” says the saintly Jansenist Quesnel here, “will always win the day over Jesus Christ despised (<span class="ital">anéanti</span>) and crucified, if the choice of a mediator between us and God is left to the vanity of the human mind.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For a (doubtful) early sanction of angel-worship see a difficult sentence in Justin, <span class="ital">Apology</span>, 1. c. 6. Irenæus, Justin’s contemporary, says (ii. 57) that the Church “does nothing by the invocation of angels.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Whatever its origin and details, such a worship inevitably beclouds the Christian’s view both of the majesty and of the nearness and tenderness of Christ his living Head.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Worshipping”:—thrêskeia;</span> a word akin perhaps in etymology to “<span class="ital">tremble</span>,” and denoting religious devotion mainly in its external aspect; a <span class="ital">cultus</span>. The word or its cognate occurs elsewhere in N.T. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm" title="Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most strait sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.">Acts 26:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/1-26.htm" title="If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain....">James 1:26-27</a>. Lightfoot quotes a sentence from Philo, the Jewish contemporary of the Apostles, where it is expressly distinguished from piety (<span class="ital">hosiotês</span>); and he says that “generally the usage of the word exhibits a tendency to a bad sense.” Such a sense is quite in point here; an unauthorized and abject <span class="ital">cultus</span> was the natural expression of a counterfeit “humility.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">intruding into</span> those things <span class="ital">which he hath not seen</span>] <span class="ital">Quœ vidit ambulans</span> (Old Latin)<span class="ital">;</span> <span class="ital">Quœ non vidit ambulans</span> (Vulgate)<span class="ital">;</span> “<span class="ital">Dwelling in the things which he hath seen</span>” (R.V.). Here are serious differences of reading and translation, which must be briefly discussed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) Shall we render “<span class="ital">Intruding into</span>,” or, “<span class="ital">Dwelling in</span>”? Classical usage of the Greek verb favours the latter rendering; the word is used e.g. of a god’s <span class="ital">haunt</span> in a region or a spot. The usage in LXX. and Apocrypha slightly favours the former rendering; the word is used there of the invasion or new occupation of a country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-51.htm" title="These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.">Joshua 19:51</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/12-25.htm" title="He removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the land of Amathis: for he gave them no respite to enter his country.">1Ma 12:25</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/14-31.htm" title="Their enemies prepared to invade their country, that they might destroy it, and lay hands on the sanctuary:">1Ma 14:31</a>). The balance must be struck by our conclusions on the rest of the phrase.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) “<span class="ital">Things which he</span> hath not <span class="ital">seen</span>”<span class="ital">:</span> “<span class="ital">Things which he</span> hath <span class="ital">seen</span>.” Is the negative to be omitted or not? “Many authorities, some ancient, insert ‘<span class="ital">not</span>’ ” (margin, R.V.). Ellicott approves the insertion of “<span class="ital">not</span>”; Lightfoot advocates the omission. It is difficult to discuss the evidence in a note, and we have attempted to state it in outline in Appendix J. Here it must suffice to say that we venture to recommend the reading <span class="bld">which he hath not seen</span>. It seems to us more likely, on a view of the facts, that the negative should have dropped out early than that it should have been deliberately inserted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If we reject “<span class="ital">not</span>,” the meaning will most probably be that the erring teacher “<span class="ital">dwells in</span>, or <span class="ital">dwells on</span>, what he has seen,” his alleged visions and revelations, the “manifestations” which he says, and perhaps thinks, he has witnessed, and which he prefers to the apostolic Gospel. If we retain “<span class="ital">not</span>,” the meaning will be that he <span class="ital">invades</span> the region of the Unseen with a presumptuous confidence of assertion, as if he <span class="ital">had</span> seen it. In either case he might <span class="ital">assert</span> his enjoyment of angelic or other visions; but in the latter case the Apostle denies such a claim if made. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-3.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!">Ezekiel 13:3</a>; “Woe unto the foolish prophets, that <span class="ital">follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">vainly</span>] The Greek word means “<span class="ital">at random</span>,” without reason or cause. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm" title="For he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that does evil.">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-2.htm" title="By which also you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached to you, unless you have believed in vain.">1 Corinthians 15:2</a>.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm" title="Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.">Ephesians 2:3</a> and note there in this Series.—In that verse “<span class="ital">flesh</span>” and “<span class="ital">mind</span>” are somewhat similarly collocated; but the word rendered (in A.V.) “<span class="ital">mind</span>” is lit. “<span class="ital">thoughts</span>”; “the mind” in particular action.—He is “puffed up” by an exercise of thought characteristic of the unregenerate state.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>L.

Jerome and Augustine both take notice of the diversity of reading, but only to reject it.—The Syriac versions, the Vulgate, Gothic, Georgian, Sclavonic, Æthiopic, Arabic, and Armenian—(we owe the information, as usual, to Dr Malan)—are to be set against the suspicious Coptic. All these then are with the Traditional Text: which cannot seriously be suspected of error.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[120] See just above on this point, in our statement of the evidence for “<span class="ital">not</span>”. (Editor.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It must be added that Lightfoot (<span class="ital">in loco</span>), and Westcott and Hort (<span class="ital">N.T. in Greek</span>, ii. 127), suspect the Greek text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a> of corruption, and suggest or adopt ingenious emendations.

Therefore Paul means to say, Let no one, usurping the authority of judge [arbitrator] of the prizes, and accordingly abusing it, guide and regulate you in the race which you are running, and mislead you by prescribing what you, about to receive the prize, should follow, what you should avoid. A French interpreter has skilfully used the word <span class="ital">maitriser</span>, “<span class="ital">to domineer;</span>” for the apostle is not speaking of a rival snatching the prize of the race before you, but of an odious, perverse, insolent judge (umpire).

They worship angels under pretext of humility and modesty, as if they dared not immediately and directly address themselves to God and Christ. “This error,” says Alexander Morus, “had driven its roots so deep into the earth, that not even after three centuries could it be pulled out; for the 35th canon of the Council of Laodicea was framed against it; and this city was the metropolis of Phrygia, where <span class="ital">Colosse</span> also was.

These eight words represent but three in the Greek.

The errorist condemns the Colossian Christian for his neglect of Jewish observances (ver. 16), and warns him that in his present state he will <span class="accented">miss the heavenly prize</span>, "the hope" he had supposed to be "in store for him in heaven" (ver. 5: comp. notes on Colossians 1:5 and Colossians 3:15; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Delighting in lowliness of mind and worship of the angels</span> (ver. 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17, 18</a>). By these means the false teacher  impressed his disciples. His angel worship commended itself as the mark of a devout and humble mind, reverent towards the unseen powers above us, and made purely <span class="accented">Christian</span> worship seem insufficient. "Delighting in" is the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> given by Bengel, Hofmann, Lightfoot, Klopper, and is preferable to that of Meyer and Ellicott, who, with several Greek interpreters, supply the sense of the previous verb "desiring (to do so) in lowliness etc.; and to that followed in the Revisers' margin,which puts a sort of adverbial sense on <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> - "of his mere will, by humility," etc. This latter rendering underlies the paraphrastic" voluntary humility" of the A.V., and agrees with the common interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 23 (see note). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is, no doubt, a marked Hebraism, and St. Paul's language is "singularly free from Hebraisms" (compare, however, the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="accented">to know</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; the similar <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is well established, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-10.htm">2 Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:12</a>). This very idiom is frequently used in the LXX, and occurs in the 'Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs,' a Christian writing, of the second century. The apostle may surely be allowed occasionally to have used a Hebraistic phrase, especially when so convenient and expressive as this. Westcott and Hort, with scrupulous purism, mark the reading on this account as doubtful. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> ("lowliness of mind"), a word, perhaps, compounded by St. Paul himself (see Trench's 'Synonyms'), is almost confined to the Epistles of this group (comp. ver. 23; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>). This quality is ascribed <span class="accented">ironically</span> to the false teacher (compare the "puffed up" of the next clause, and for similar irony see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-17.htm">Galatians 4:17</a>). <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is "outward worship" or "devotion:" comp. note on ver. 23; elsewhere in New Testament only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26, 27</a> (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). "Worship of the angels" is that <span class="accented">paid to the angels</span>; not "offered by them," as Luther and Hofmann interpret, supposing that the errorists pretended to imitate the worship of heaven. <span class="cmt_word">Investigating</span> (or, <span class="accented">dwelling on</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the things which he hath seen'! vainly - being puffed up by 'the reason' of his flesh</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>:l, 7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-16.htm">Jude 1:16</a>). For <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, we adopt the sense which it bears in 2 Macc. 2:30; in Philo, 'On the Planting of Noah,' &sect; 19. and in patristic and later Greek generally, viz. "to search into," "examine," "discuss" (see Suicer's 'Thesaurus'). The rendering "proceeding" or "dwelling on," though near the radical sense of the word ("to step on" or "in"), wants lexical support. The same may be said of the rendering "intruding into," which suits the Received reading, "which he hath <span class="accented">not</span> seen." The "not" of the relative clause is wanting in nearly all our eldest and best witnesses, and is cancelled by the Revisers, with Tregelles, Tischendorf, Lightfoot, Westcott and Hort, etc. Its appearance in two different forms (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>) in the documents that present it, makes it still more certain that it is a copyist's insertion. The common reading gives, after all, an unsatisfactory sense; it is not likely the apostle would blame the errorist simply for entering into things beyond his sight (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Meyer, after Steiger and Huther, gives the best explanation of "which he hath seen," supposing the writer to allude ironically to <span class="accented">pretended visions</span> of angels or of the spiritual world, by which the false teacher sought to impose on the Colossians. This view is suggested by Tertullian in the passage cited under ver. 16. Such visions would be suitable for the purpose of the errorist, and congenial to the Phrygian temperament, with its tendency to mysticism and ecstasy (see Theodoret, quoted under ver. 15, who also says that <span class="accented">angel worship</span> was specially forbidden by the Council of Laodicea, A.n. 364). If the false teacher were accustomed to say with an imposing air, "I have seen, ah! I have seen!" in referring to his revelations, the apostle's allusion would be obvious and telling. The language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a> (R.V.) suggests a similar reliance on supernatural visions on the part of the apostle's earlier opponents. This pretentious visionary is, however, a "philosopher" and a "reasoner" first of all (vers. 4, 8). Accordingly he <span class="accented">investigates what he has seen</span>; inquires into the import of his visions, rationally develops their principles, and deduces their consequences. So far, the apostle continues in the ironical vein in which the first words of the verse are written, setting forth the pretensions of his opponent in his own terms, his irony "restraining itself till, after the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, the indignation of truth breaks forth from it" (Steiger) in the caustic and decisive "vainly." <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;</span> qualifies the foregoing participle (so Origen, apparently, in Cramer's 'Catena,' vol. 4. p. 69; Steiger, De Wette, Hofmann, Conybeare) more suitably than the following. Thus it signifies "idly," "to no purpose," as everywhere else in St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-2.htm">1 Corinthians 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-4.htm">Galatians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>); not "without cause," as joined to <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("puffed up"), whose 'force it could only weaken. "Vainly" stigmatizes the futility, "puffed up" the conceit, and "by the reason of his flesh" the low and sensuous origin of these vaunted revelations and of the high-flown theosophy which they were used to support. (For the sarcastic force of "puffed up," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>). The "reason" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>) is, in Greek philosophy, the philosophical faculty, the power of supersensible intuition; and in Plato and Philo, the organ of the higher, mystical knowledge of Divine things (see Philo, 'Who is Heir of Divine Things?' &sect;&sect; 13, 20, and <span class="accented">passim</span>). The Colossian "philosopher" (ver. 8) would, we may imagine, speak of himself as "borne aloft" in his visions "by heavenly reason," "lifted high in angelical communion," or the like. Hence the apostle's sarcasm, "Exalted are they? say rather, <span class="accented">inflated: lifted high by Divine reason?</span> nay, but <span class="accented">swollen high by the reason of their flesh."</span> Some such allusion to the language of the errorists best accounts for the paradoxical <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (see Lightfoot); contrast with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>, and compare the disparaging reference to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">Colossians</span> 1:21 (note). Difficult as this passage is, we hesitate to follow Lightfoot, and Westcott and Herr, who have given their weighty sanction to the perilous remedy of <span class="accented">conjectural emendations</span>; the latter editors for the second Line in this verse, and again in ver. 23. The line of interpretation here adopted is advocated in the <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, first series, vol. 11. pp. 385-398. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Beguile of reward (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;)<p>Only here in the New Testament.

Hence to decide against one, or to declare him unworthy of the prize. Bishop Lightfoot's rendering rob you of your prize, adopted by Rev., omits the judicial idea, which, however, I think must be retained, in continuation of the idea of judgment in <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a>, "let no man judge," etc. The attitude of the false teachers would involve their sitting in judgment as to the future reward of those who refused their doctrine of angelic mediation. Paul speaks from the standpoint of their claim.<p>In a voluntary humility (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>Render delighting in humility.

It falls in, in the regular participial series, with the other declarations as to the vain conceit of the teachers; signifying not their purpose or their wish to deprive the Christians of their reward, but their vain enthusiasm for their false doctrine, and their conceited self-complacency which prompted them to sit as judges. The worship of angels involved a show of humility, an affectation of superior reverence for God, as shown in the reluctance to attempt to approach God otherwise than indirectly: in its assumption that humanity, debased by the contact with matter, must reach after God through successive grades of intermediate beings. For humility, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>.<p>Worship of angels (&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;)<p>See on religious, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a>.

So 2 Macc. 2:30, and so Philo, who compares truth-seekers to well-diggers. Patristic writers use it of searching the heart, and of investigating divine mysteries. Byzantine lexicographers explain it by &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9; to seek; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9; to track out; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9; to consider. In this last sense the word is probably used here of the false teachers who professed to see heavenly truth in visions, and to investigate and discuss philosophically the revelation they had received.<p>Which he hath not seen<p>Not must be omitted: which he imagines or professes that he has seen in vision. Ironical. "If, as we may easily imagine, these pretenders were accustomed to say with an imposing and mysterious air, 'I have seen, ah! I have seen,' - in relating alleged visions of heavenly things, the Colossians would understand the reference well enough" (Findlay).<p>Vainly puffed up (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Vainly characterizes the emptiness of such pretension; puffed up, the swelling intellectual pride of those who make it.

The humility is thus characterized as affected, and the teachers as charlatans.<p>By his fleshly mind (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Lit., by the mind of his flesh. The intellectual faculty in its moral aspects as determined by the fleshly, sinful nature. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-22.htm">Romans 7:22-25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-7.htm">Romans 8:7</a>. The teachers boasted that they were guided by the higher reason. Paul describes their higher reason as carnal. </body></html>
