St. Paul bids them seek not only the first basis of their faith, but their continual growth, in Christ alone, by continual “strengthening in the faith” which rests in Him.

When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rooted ...in him - As a tree strikes its roots deep in the earth, so our faith should strike deep into the doctrine respecting the Saviour.

By these metaphors, the apostle expresses the safe and happy state of these believers; and which he makes use of as arguments, to engage them to walk on in Christ, and as pointing out the manner in which they should. Believers are sometimes compared to trees, and are trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord; and their root is Christ, from whence as such they spring, and by whom they are filled with the fruits of righteousness; in him they are to abide, keep close unto him, and walk in him; deriving all their life, nourishment, fruitfulness, grace, and perseverance in it, from him as their root: they are also sometimes compared to a building, to an house, a temple, an habitation for God; and Christ is the sure and only foundation on which they are laid, and where they are safe and secure; and, being fitly joined together, grow up as an holy temple to the Lord; and this being their case, they are to go on laying the whole stress of their salvation on him, building their faith and hope of eternal glory entirely upon him; and building up one another also on their most holy faith, of which he is the substance, as it follows: <p>and stablished in the faith: that of Christ, or in the doctrine of faith which respects Christ: the apostle here expresses the same thing without a figure, which he had signified by the two foregoing metaphors, and explains what he means by them; namely, that they were well settled and grounded in their faith in Christ, and thoroughly instructed and established in the doctrines of the Gospel; and a very good thing it is to have the heart established with grace, both as a principle and a doctrine; which is God's work, and was the happy case of these persons; wherefore it became them to act as such, and not be like children tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, or carried about with divers and strange doctrines, but abide by those which had been preached to them by the faithful ministers of Christ, and they had received: as <p>ye have been taught: by Epaphras their minister, and others; and therefore should not listen to false teachers, and to a contrary doctrine taught by them; considering of whom they had learnt the true doctrine, what evidence it carried with it, and what use it had been of to them, in convincing, converting, comforting, instructing, and establishing them: and therefore should be <p>abounding therein with thanksgiving; that is, in the faith; as in the grace, so in the doctrine of faith; for as saints are to abound in the work of the Lord, and in every good work, and in the exercise of every grace, so in the knowledge of truth; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-7.htm">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>; and to make use of all means for the increase of, and growth in Gospel grace and light, and the knowledge of a crucified Christ, which is meant by abounding: for all which there is great reason for thanksgiving; both for the unspeakable gift of Christ, who is received as such by faith, and in whom believers are rooted and built up; and for faith itself, which is the gift of God; and also for the Gospel, and the truths of it; and for every degree of spiritual light in it, and knowledge of it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-7.htm" title=" Rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, as you have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.">Colossians 2:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐρριζωμένοι καὶ ἐποικοδομούμενοι</span>: “rooted and built up”. The metaphor changes from <span class="greekheb">περιπατ</span>., and again from <span class="greekheb">ἐρριζ</span>., though Lightfoot points out that the term “to root” is not infrequently applied to buildings. More important is the change in tense, the perfect participle expressing an abiding result, the present a continuous process. <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span> probably belongs to both. We should not (with Schenkel, Hofm.) place a full stop at <span class="greekheb">περιπ</span>. and take the participles with <span class="greekheb">βλέπετε</span>, which would be intolerably awkward.—<span class="greekheb">βεβαιούμενοι τῇ πίστει</span>: “stablished in faith,” also the present of continuous process.

The words define <span class="greekheb">τῇ πίστει</span>.—<span class="greekheb">περισσεύοντες ἐν εὐχαριστίᾳ</span>. Oltramare notes that “thankfulness is a preservative against the new doctrines,” since they remove Christ from His true place.

It recurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17</a>, the only other place in which St Paul uses precisely this metaphor, which combines the thought of fixity with that of derived and developing life from a genial source. There, as here, the metaphor of <span class="ital">building</span> (more frequent with St Paul) appears, in the Greek, beside this other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">built up</span>] See the last remark. The Greek is a present participle, to be expressed in (not quite classical) English by, <span class="bld">being built up</span>.

But the phrase “<span class="bld"><span class="ital">in</span></span> Him” just below suggests here another of the many sides of His relation to the “building”; and leads us to explain this of the internal “building up” of the community as new members join it and cohere with it; and also of the individual, as layers (so to speak) of experience and spiritual character accrue in his life and walk. The <span class="ital">present</span> participle is thus clearly suitable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Him</span>] as He is the “Stone of the angle” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-20.htm" title="And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;">Ephesians 2:20</a>) “in” which the converging lines of structure hold together.

Their faith, their submissive personal reliance on their Lord, would “strike their <span class="ital">root</span> downward” and compact their spiritual <span class="ital">structure;</span> and so it would make them continuously more stable. “Faith is, as it were, the cement of the building” (Lightfoot).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as ye have been taught</span>] Better, <span class="bld">as ye were taught</span>, when Epaphras evangelized them.

The Revisers relegate "in it (your faith)" to the margin, following the judgment of Tischendorf and Tregelles; while Westcott and Hort, Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, retain the words in the text. The reading "in him," found in the Vulgate and leading Western documents, throws doubt on these words; but it is difficult to see why they should have been inserted if not authentic, and they might easily be confused by a copyist with the foregoing "in him."

It must be said that &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9; to cause to take root is often used in the sense of firmness or fixedness without regard to its primary meaning. Built up.
