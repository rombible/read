They, however, have in common that they all suggest an initial act by which we are brought into connection with Christ, and a subsequent process flowing from and following on it. Receiving Christ, being rooted in Him, being founded on Him, stand for the first; walking in Him, growing up from the root in Him, being built up on Him as foundation, stand for the second. Fully expressed then, the text would run, ‘As ye have received Christ, so walk in Him; as ye have been rooted in Him, so grow up in Him; as ye have been founded on Him, so be builded up.’ These three clauses present the one idea in slightly different forms. The first expresses Christian progress as the manifestation before the world of an inward possession, the exhibition in the outward life of a treasure hid in the heart. The second expresses the same progress as the development by its own vital energy of the life of Christ in the soul. The third expresses the progress as the addition, by conscious efforts, of portion after portion to the character, which is manifestly incomplete until the headstone crowns the structure. We may then take the passage before us as exhibiting the principles of Christian progress.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The origin of all, or how Christian progress begins.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These three figures, receiving, rooted, founded, all express a great deal more than merely accepting certain truths about Him. The acceptance of truths is the means by which we come to what is more than any belief of truths. We possess Christ when we believe with a true faith in Him. We are rooted in Him. His life flows into us. We draw nourishment from that soil. We are built on Him, and in our compact union find a real support to a life which is otherwise baseless and blown about like thistledown by every breath. The union which all these metaphors presupposes is a vital connection; the possession which is the first step in the Christian life is a real possession.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is no progress without that initial step. Our own experience tells us but too plainly and loudly that we need the impartation of a new life, and to be set on a new foundation, if we are ever to be anything else than failures and blots.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is sure to be progress if the initial step has been taken. If Christ has been received, the life possessed will certainly manifest itself. It will go on to perfection. The union effected will work on through the whole character and nature. It is the beginning of all; it is only the beginning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The manner of Christian progress or in what it consists.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It consists in a more complete possession of Him, in a more constant approximation to Him, and a more entire appropriation of Him. Christian progress is not a growing up from Christ as starting-point, but into Christ as goal. All is contained in the first act by which He is first received; the remainder is but the working out of that. All our growth in knowledge and wisdom consists in our knowing what we have when we receive Christ. We grow in proportion as we learn to see in Him the centre of all truth, as the Revealer of God, as the Teacher of man, as the Interpreter of nature, as the meaning and end of history, as the Lord of life and death. Morals, politics, and philosophy flow from Him. His lips and His life and death proclaim all truth, human and divine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As in wisdom so in character, all progress consists in coming closer to Jesus and receiving more and more of His many-sided grace. He is the pattern of all excellence, the living ideal of whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, virtue incarnate, praise embodied. He is the power by which we become gradually and growingly moulded into His likeness. Every part of our nature finds its best stimulus in Jesus for individuals and for societies. Christ and growth into Him is progress, and the only way by which men can be presented perfect, is that they shall be presented ‘perfect in Christ,’ whereunto every man must labour who would that his labour should not be in vain. That progress must follow the threefold direction in the text. There must first be the progressive manifestation in act and life of the Christ already possessed, ‘As ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him.’ There must also be the completer growth in the soul of the new life already received. As the leaf grows green and broad, so a Christlike character must grow not altogether by effort. And there must be a continual being builded up in Him by constant additions to the fabric of graces set on that foundation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The means, or how it is accomplished.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first words of our text tell us that ‘Ye have received Christ Jesus as Lord,’ and all depends on keeping the channels of communication open so that the reception may be continuous and progressive. We must live near and ever nearer to the Lord, and seek that our communion with Him may be strengthened. On the other hand, it is not only by the spontaneous development of the implanted life, but by conscious and continuous efforts which sometimes involve vigorous repression of the old self that progress is realised. The two metaphors of our text have to be united in our experience. Neither the effortless growth of the tree nor the toilsome work of the builder suffice to represent the whole truth. The two sides of deep and still communion, and of strenuous effort based on that communion, must be found in the experience of every Christian who has received Christ, and is advancing through the imperfect manifestations of earth to the perfect union with, and perfect assimilation to, the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To all men who are ready to despair of themselves, here is the way to realise the grandest hopes. Nothing is too great to be attained by one who, having received Christ Jesus as Lord, walks in Him, rooted and builded up in Him, ‘a holy temple to the Lord.’ <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/colossians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-6.htm" title=" As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in him:...">Colossians 2:6-7</a></span>. <span class="ital">As, </span>or <span class="ital">since, ye have received Christ Jesus the Lord </span>— Have acknowledged Jesus of Nazareth to be the true Messiah promised to the Jews, and consequently a divinely-commissioned Teacher, Mediator, Saviour, and Lawgiver; yea, the great Prophet, Priest, and King of his church, and therefore your sovereign Lord, and the final Judge of men and angels; <span class="ital">so walk ye in him </span>— Let your spirit and conduct, your dispositions, words, and actions, be in perfect consistency with this acknowledgment; walk in the same faith, love, and holiness, in which you received him, steadily believing his doctrines, obeying his precepts, relying on his promises, revering his threatenings, and imitating his example; <span class="ital">rooted </span>— In him, as trees in a good soil, or as the graft is rooted in the stock; <span class="ital">and built</span> — Upon him, the only sure foundation of your confidence and hope for time and eternity; <span class="ital">and established in the faith </span>— In your persuasion of the truth and importance of the gospel in all its parts; <span class="ital">as ye have been taught</span> — By those that have preached it to you; <span class="ital">abounding therein </span>— Making continual progress in your acquaintance with it and conformity to it; <span class="ital">with thanksgiving </span>— To God, for having made you partakers of so great a blessing.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/colossians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-7 The soul prospers when we have clear knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord - Have received him by faith as your Saviour, or as you were instructed respecting his rank, character, and work. The object here is to induce them not to swerve from the views which they had of Christ when he was made known to them. They had at first probably received their ideas of the Saviour from the apostle himself (see the  Introduction); and, at any rate, the apostle designs to assure them that the views which they had when they "received him," were founded in truth.<p>So walk in him - Continue in those views of Christ; live in the maintenance of them; let them regulate your whole conduct. The word walk, in the Scriptures, is used to denote the manner of life; and the sense here is, that they should live and act wholly under the influence of the conceptions which they had of the Saviour when they first embraced him. The particle "so" is supplied by our translators, and rather weakens the sense. No stress should be laid on it, as is often done. The meaning is, simply, "Since you have received Christ as your Lord, as he was preached to you, hold fast the doctrine which you have received, and do not permit yourselves to be turned aside by any Jewish teachers, or teachers of philosophy." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Receiving Christ is believing in him: faith is the eye of the soul, that sees the beauty, glory, fulness, and suitableness of Christ; the foot that goes to him, and the hand that takes hold on him, and the arm that receives and embraces him; so that this is not a receiving him into the head by notion, but into the heart by faith; and not in part only, but in whole: faith receives a whole Christ, his person as God and man; him in all his offices, as prophet, priest, and King; particularly as a Saviour and Redeemer, he being under that character so exceeding suitable to the case of a sensible sinner; and it receives all blessings of grace along with him, from him, and through him; as a justifying righteousness, remission of sins, adoption of children, grace for grace, and an inheritance among all them that are sanctified; and both Christ and them, as the free grace gifts of God; which men are altogether undeserving of, and cannot possibly give any valuable consideration for: so these Colossians had received Christ gladly, joyfully, willingly, and with all readiness; and especially as "the Lord", on which there is a peculiar emphasis in the text; they had received him and believed in him, as the one and only Lord and head of the church; as the one and only Mediator between God and man, to the exclusion of angels, the worship of which the false teachers were introducing; they had received the doctrines of Christ, and not the laws of Moses, which judaizing preachers were desirous of joining with them; they had heard and obeyed the Son, and not the servant; they had submitted to the authority of Christ as King of saints, and had been subject to his ordinances; wherefore the apostle exhorts them to continue and go on, believing in him, and holding to him the head: <p>so walk ye in him; not only in imitation of him as he walked, in the exercise of grace, as love, patience, humility, and meekness, and in the discharge of duty; but by faith in him, going on in a way of believing in him, always looking to him, leaning on him, and deriving grace and strength from him: to walk in Christ, is to walk in and after the Spirit of Christ, under his influence, by his direction, and through his assistance; and to walk in the doctrine of Christ, abiding by it, and increasing in the knowledge of it; and to walk in the ordinances of Christ, which with ills presence and spirit, are ways of pleasantness and paths of peace: particularly here it may signify, to make use of Christ, and walk on in him, as the way, truth, and the life; as the only way of access to God, and acceptance with him; as the way of salvation, as the only true way to eternal life and happiness, in opposition to every creature, angels, or men; the worshipping of the one, or works done by the other. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As ye have therefore <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> received Christ Jesus the Lord, <i>so</i> walk ye in him:</span><p>(h) So then Christ does not depend upon men's traditions.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm" title=" As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in him:">Colossians 2:6</a> f.

In like manner we should have to take the reading <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πίστει</span>, which Hofmann defends.

For this they have received (from Epaphras, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm" title=" As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;">Colossians 1:7</a>) the instructions which are to guide them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">περισσεύοντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] is subordinate to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΕΒΑΙΟΎΜ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, and that as specifying the <span class="ital">measure</span> of the faith, which must be found in them in order that they may be stablished through faith; while at the same time the requisite <span class="ital">vital expression, consecrated to God, of the piety</span> of the believing heart is brought out by <span class="greekheb">ἐν εὐχαρ</span>.: <span class="ital">while ye are abounding in the same amidst thanksgiving, i.e</span>. while ye are truly <span class="ital">rich</span> in faith, and at the same time giving thanks to God for this blessing of fulness of faith. The emphasis is upon <span class="greekheb">περισσ</span>., in which lies the more <span class="ital">precisely defining</span> element; <span class="greekheb">περισσεύειν ἐν</span> is nothing else than the usual <span class="ital">abundare aliqua re, to have abundance of something</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-13.htm" title="Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="However, there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm" title="And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;">Php 1:9</a>, <span class="ital">et al</span>.), and <span class="greekheb">ἐν εὐχαρ</span>. indicates an <span class="ital">accompanying circumstance in the case</span>, the ethical consecration of grateful piety, with which the richness in faith must be combined; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-17.htm" title=" And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.">Colossians 3:17</a>, <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm" title=" As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in him:">Colossians 2:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὧς οὖν παρελάβετε</span>. Oltramare translates “since,” and interprets, “since ye have received Christ … it is in Him you must walk”. But probably the usual interpretation “as” is right, meaning the form in which they had received (= <span class="greekheb">καθὼς ἐμάθετε</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm" title=" As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;">Colossians 1:7</a>). The sense is, in that case, live in accordance with what you received, and the emphasis is on <span class="greekheb">περιπ</span>., not on <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῷ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">παρελάβετε</span> is practically equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἐμάθετε</span>, received by instruction, rather than received into the heart.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν τὸν Κύριον</span>. This is frequently translated “the Christ, even Jesus the Lord” (Hofm., Lightf., Sod., Haupt, Abb.). In favour of this is the fact that <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. is not a Pauline expression, but neither is <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ Κύριος</span>. A further argument in its favour is that <span class="greekheb">ὁ Χριστός</span> is very frequent in this Epistle, and especially prominent in this section of it. If this is so we must suppose that Paul has chosen the form of words to meet some false view at Colossæ. A reference to a Judaistic conception of the Messiah, held by the false teachers, which failed to rise to the Christian conception of His Person as Lord, is supposed by Haupt to be intended. This is possible, but the other possible view “ye received Christ Jesus as Lord” is no more inconsistent with Pauline usage, and emphasises still more the Lordship of Christ, which it was the chief aim of the Apostle to assert. There seems to be no hint that the Messiahship of Jesus was challenged; at most there was the question what Messiahship involved. More probably there is no reference to the Messiahship at all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">As ye have therefore</span> &c.] As if to say, “I see with joy your present stedfast faith and consequent holy union; therefore I entreat you at once to stay there and to grow there, for you will be tempted towards a very different region otherwise.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">Have received</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—somewhat better, <span class="bld">did receive</span>, at their conversion.—The Greek word rendered “<span class="ital">receive</span>” is frequently used of the reception of <span class="ital">teaching</span>,—learning; and no doubt the reference is mainly to their “reception” from their missionary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-7.htm" title=" As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;">Colossians 1:7</a>) of the revealed <span class="ital">truth</span>. See further just below. But Ellicott well says that “the object [Christ] is so emphatically specified” as to imply that “they received … Christ Himself, in Himself the sum and substance of all teaching.” Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm" title="But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:">John 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/5-11.htm" title="And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son....">1 John 5:11-12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Christ Jesus the Lord</span>] Lightfoot punctuates and renders, <span class="bld">the Christ, even Jesus the Lord</span>; taking the reference to be to their having learned and welcomed as the true <span class="ital">Christ</span> (Messiah) not the speculative “Christ” of the heretics but the historic <span class="ital">Jesus</span> of the Incarnation and the Cross. This rendering (in view of the Greek) strongly commends itself to us, though R.V. retains A.V. In any case, however, the solemn emphasis of the whole phrase points in the direction of thought indicated by Lightfoot.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">The Lord</span>”<span class="ital">:</span>—doubtless in the highest sense of the word.

"Jesus is Lord" was the testing watchword applied in the discerning of spirits; "Jesus Christ is Lord" is to be the final confession of a reconciled universe; and "Christ Jesus is Lord" is the rule of faith that guides all conduct and tests all doctrine within the Church (comp. ver. 19; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>). It is "a summary of the whole Christian confession" (Meyer). To vindicate this lordship, on which the Colossian error trenched so seriously, is the main object of the Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-20</a>). We must not, therefore, with Alford, Lightfoot, Hofmann, analyze "the Christ Jesus:" "Ye received the Christ, (namely) Jesus, who is the Lord." The writer has already used "Christ Jesus" as a single proper name at the outset (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1, 4</a>); and it was the <span class="accented">lordship of Christ Jesus, not the Messiahship of Jesus</span>, that was now in question. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5, 28</a> the situation is entirely different. In the following clause, "in him" is emphatic, as in ver. 7 (compare the predominant <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9-15</a>). Hence the contradiction of figure, "walk, rooted, and builded up," does not obtrude itself. (On "walk," see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>; and on "in Christ" in this connection, see notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm">Colossians 2:10</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-7</a>.) <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ye received (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>By transmission from (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;) your teachers.<p>Christ Jesus the Lord (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x399;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The Christ, specially defined by the following words, thus emphasizing the personal Christ rather than the Gospel, because the true doctrine of Christ's person was perverted by the Colossian teachers. The Christ, even Jesus, the Lord. </body></html>
