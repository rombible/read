But the last word—which signifies, not only “using,” but <span class= "ital">“</span>using up”—seems to decide for the latter alternative. The things are things which go to destruction and are used up. What permanent effect can they leave behind?

But it is not warrantable; it is taking that honour which is due to Christ only, and giving it to a creature. There really was pride in this seeming humility. Those who worship angels, disclaim Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man. It is an insult to Christ, who is the Head of the church, to use any intercessors but him. When men let go their hold of Christ, they catch at what will stand them in no stead. The body of Christ is a growing body. And true believers cannot live in the fashions of the world. True wisdom is, to keep close to the appointments of the gospel; in entire subjection to Christ, who is the only Head of his church. Self-imposed sufferings and fastings, might have a show of uncommon spirituality and willingness for suffering, but this was not in any honour to God. The whole tended, in a wrong manner, to satisfy the carnal mind, by gratifying self-will, self-wisdom, self-righteousness, and contempt of others. The things being such as carry not with them so much as the show of wisdom; or so faint a show that they do the soul no good, and provide not for the satisfying of the flesh. What the Lord has left indifferent, let us regard as such, and leave others to the like freedom; and remembering the passing nature of earthly things, let us seek to glorify God in the use of them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which all are to perish with the using - This is commonly marked as a part of the parenthesis, or the quotation; and there is considerable difficulty in ascertaining its true meaning. It seems most probable that these are the words of the apostle himself, thrown in in the rapidity of composition, and that they are not to be connected with the phrase "touch not," etc. If so, the idea is, that it cannot be of so much consequence as the Jewish teachers supposed, to mark distinctly the difference between meats and drinks. They were all to perish with the use of them. Nothing was permanent about them. It could really then be of no great importance what was eaten, or what was drunk, provided it was not in itself injurious. These ordinances had a value among the Hebrews when it was designed to keep them as a distinct people; but they had no value in themselves, so as to make them binding on all mankind. To suppose this, was the common error of the Jews; and hence, the apostle so frequently labored to show that the Jewish rites had no permanent value; see the <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/14-1.htm">Romans 14:1-6</a> notes; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-13</a>, note; compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/15-17.htm">Matthew 15:17-18</a>. According to this interpretation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-21.htm">Colossians 2:21</a> should be regarded as expressing the common maxim of the Jewish teachers, and the clause before us as the words of the apostle, and should be marked as a parenthesis. So it is marked in Hahn's Ed. of the New Testament.<p>After the commandments and doctrines of men - Many of the ordinances on which the Jews insisted were those which were handed down by tradition. They depended on human authority only, and of course, should not bind the conscience. Others take the words here to mean, "All which things tend to the corruption of religion (Doddridge), or are cause of destruction or condemnation (Robinson, Lexicon), by the use of these things, according to the commandments and doctrines of these men." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

And therefore to urge the reviving of antiquated ordinances, or bringing in such like new ones, is to corrupt or consume the creatures without any spiritual advantage, whereupon such impositions must needs be destructive; and because of the apostle’s stronger argument, they are not after Christ, but after the precepts and decrees of men, compare <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a></span>, which is our Lord aud Master’s argument against the inovations of the Pharisees, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-9.htm" title="But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.">Matthew 15:9</a></span>, agreeing with the prophet, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm" title="Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:">Isaiah 29:13</a></span>.

Meaning either the ordinances concerning touching, tasting, and handling, which bring destruction and death on them that use them, and comply with them, in order to obtain righteousness and life; for instead of enjoying salvation through them, they were the cause of damnation to them. Or rather the meats not to be touched, tasted, or handled; these are in their own nature perishing things, and perish by being used; they are only of service to the body, and can be of none to the soul; the using of them cannot defile the man, nor an abstinence from them sanctify him, or commend him to God; they only relate to this present life, and will cease with it, and can have no manner of influence on the spiritual and eternal concerns of men: and besides, the ordinances concerning them are not of God, but are <p>after the commandments and doctrines of men; for so even the ceremonial law, being now abolished, though originally of God, yet the imposition of it, as necessary to salvation, was a commandment and doctrine of man's; and particularly the traditions of the elders, and the various rules and decrees, which the doctors among the Jews obliged men to regard, were human inventions and devices: and this is another reason the apostle makes use of to dissuade from any regard unto them; for whatever is of man, and not of God, in religious worship, ought to be rejected. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{22}</span> Which all are to perish with the using;) <span class="cverse3">{23}</span> after the commandments and doctrines of men?</span><p>(22) Another argument: the spiritual and inward kingdom of God cannot consist in these outward things, which perish with the using.<p>(23) The third argument: because God is not the author of these traditions, therefore they are not that which we are obligated to do.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-22.htm" title=" Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?">Colossians 2:22</a>.

We have here a similar line of argument to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-17.htm" title="Do not you yet understand, that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?">Matthew 15:17</a>. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm" title="Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.">1 Corinthians 6:13</a>. Hence <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span> is meant to denote the perishing which takes place through the natural dissolution (digestion) of the meats and drinks; and with this conception quite accords the purposely-chosen compound <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἀποχρήσει</span>, which, like <span class="ital">abusus</span>, indicates the <span class="ital">using up</span>, the <span class="ital">consuming</span> (Plut. <span class="ital">Mor</span>. p. 267 E; Davis, <span class="ital">ad Cic. N. D</span>. iv. 60). So it is unanimously explained by Chrysostom, Theodoret (<span class="greekheb">εἰς κόπρον γὰρ ἅπαντα μεταβάλλεται</span>), Oecumenius (<span class="greekheb">φθορᾷ γὰρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑπόκειται ἐν τῷ ἀφεδρῶνι</span>), Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Beza, Calvin, Wolf, Grotius, Michaelis, and many others, including Bähr, Steiger, Olshausen, Ewald, Bleek, Hofmann. But, according to others, who likewise regard <span class="greekheb">ἅ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀποχρ</span>. as a parenthetical judgment, the <span class="greekheb">ἅ</span> is to be referred to the prohibitions, <span class="greekheb">ἀποχρ</span>. to the <span class="ital">use, i.e</span>. the following of them, and <span class="greekheb">φθορά</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-8.htm" title="For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.">Galatians 6:8</a>) to the destruction of the persons who follow them: <span class="ital">all which</span> <span class="greekheb">δόγματα</span> <span class="ital">by their use tend to</span> (eternal) <span class="ital">destruction</span>. So Ambrosiaster, Augustine, Cornelius a Lapide, Calixtus, Heumann, Junker. Erroneously; because <span class="greekheb">ἀπόχρησις</span> never means merely <span class="ital">use</span>, and even the simple <span class="greekheb">χρῆσις</span>, in the sense of <span class="greekheb">τήρησις</span>, would be an unsuitable designation; in fact, the entire addition, “by the use,” would be utterly superfluous. On account of <span class="greekheb">ἀποχρ</span>., the expedient must also be rejected, on linguistic grounds, that <span class="greekheb">ἅ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀποχρ</span>. are still <span class="ital">words of the false teachers</span>, which Paul repeats with irony: “<span class="ital">omnia haec</span> (vetita) <span class="ital">usu suo perniciem afferunt</span>,” Heinrichs, comp. Schenkel. By others, who, like Tischendorf, have deleted the marks of parenthesis, the whole down to <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπων</span> is taken together: all this, which the false teachers forbid, tends through the using to (“moral,” de Wette) destruction, “si sc. <span class="ital">ex doctorum Judaicorum praeceptis et doctrinis</span> hac de re judicium feratur,”[133] Kypke; so also Vatablus, Storr, Flatt, Böhmer, de Wette, Baumgarten-Crusius (Huther is undecided between this explanation and ours). But in opposition to this it may be urged, that the compound <span class="greekheb">ἀποχρήσει</span> would be entirely <span class="ital">without a motive</span>, since not the <span class="ital">consumption</span>, but the <span class="ital">use</span> at all would be soul-destroying according to the maxims of those people. Our view alone supplies a <span class="ital">motive</span> for the use of <span class="greekheb">ἀποχρήσει</span>, and that through the <span class="ital">point</span> of its connection with <span class="greekheb">εἰς φθοράν</span>, in which case, however, the object affected by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΧΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς ΦΘΟΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> must be the <span class="ital">same</span> (the things forbidden). De Wette’s objections are irrelevant, since the thought of the parenthesis <span class="greekheb">ἅ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀποχρ</span>. is expressed not strangely, but with Pauline ingenuity, the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤᾺ ΤᾺ ἘΝΤΆΛΜ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> annexed to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΟΓΜΑΤΊΖΕΣΘΕ</span></span></span> are by no means superfluous (see below), nor does this annexation require us to begin the parenthesis with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ἍΨῌ</span></span></span> and thereby to include heterogeneous elements together; for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ἍΨῌ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> still belongs closely to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΟΓΜΑΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, of which it is the contents, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤᾺ ΤᾺ ἘΝΤΆΛΜ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is then annexed, after the brief incidentally inserted remark, to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΟΓΜΑΤ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> <span class="ital">and</span> its contents (<span class="greekheb">μὴ ἅψῃ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤᾺ ΤᾺ ἘΝΤΆΛΜΑΤΑ Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>] The article before <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝΤΆΛΜ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, and extending also to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΔΑΣΚΑΛ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>, is <span class="ital">generic</span>.

Augustine and Calvin took <span class="greekheb">ἅ</span> as meaning the ordinances referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-20.htm" title=" Why if you be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are you subject to ordinances,">Colossians 2:20</a>, and explained the words as Paul’s refutation, “all which ordinances lead in their use to spiritual destruction”. But <span class="greekheb">ἀποχ</span>. means much more than use, it means abuse or using up; and <span class="greekheb">ἅ</span> refers more naturally to the prohibited things than to the prohibitions; while the sense would be complete if <span class="greekheb">τῇ ἀποχ</span>. were omitted. A much more attractive interpretation is that of De Wette (followed by Grimm, Ol. and others). He regards the words as a continuation of the injunctions of the false teachers, “all which things tend to spiritual destruction in the abuse”. The sense will then be that certain meats and drinks are forbidden, because the abuse of them leads to spiritual destruction. Lightfoot says “this interpretation, however, has nothing to recommend it”. This is perhaps too strong, for on the usual view <span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπων</span> comes in awkwardly, as its place is at the end of the prohibitions. But it must be rejected. The translation is a little strained, and it would have been much simpler to say “the use of these things is destructive”. It is therefore best to adhere to the common view, and translate “all which things are to perish with the using”. The meaning is, then, that with consumption the forbidden meats and drinks were destined to perish. This interpretation has the advantage of being forcible, for it throws one side of Paul’s refutation into a terse parenthesis. His argument is, these meats and drinks, on which the false teachers lay such stress, are of no such importance, for in the nature of things they perish in their very use. If we can annihilate them they cannot rule us. The words should be included in brackets.—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὰ ἐντὰλματα καὶ διδασκαλίας τῶν ἀνθρώπων</span>: to be taken with <span class="greekheb">δογματίζεσθε</span>. This states the other side of Paul’s refutation. The precepts are not only concerned with things destined to perish, they have their source in human commandments. Lightfoot aptly points out the striking parallel between these words of Paul and those of Christ on defilement (Mark 7). Both argue from the perishableness of meats, both treat these things as indifferent in themselves, and both quote Isaiah. Even though these precepts are partially found in the O.T., they are rightly called precepts of men, partly because they went beyond what it enjoined, partly because their object is different.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">which all are to perish with the using;</span>)] Lit., <span class="bld">which are all for corruption in the consumption</span>. I.e., the things which are thus forbidden as soul-tainting are things merely material, not moral, and this is evidenced by their merely material destiny—physical dissolution in the course of natural use.

This is the position which Christ himself takes in regard to Jewish distinctions of meats (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-14.htm">Mark 7:14-23</a>, R.V.). We note the same style of sarcastic comment on the language of the false teachers as that exhibited in ver. 18. Augustine, Calvin, and some ethers render, "which (decrees) tend to (spiritual) destruction in their use;" but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> never means simply "use," and the antecedent "decrees" is awkwardly supplied. More plausibly, De Wette and some moderns interpret, "things which tend to (spiritual) destruction in their abuse," putting the words in the mouth of the false teacher, as though he said, "Abstain from everything the use of which may be fatal to the soul." But this ascribes to the errorist an argument which fails short of his principles (see note on "hard treatment of the body," ver. 23); and to which, specious as it is, and in harmony with the apostle's own teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-12.htm">1 Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-26.htm">1 Corinthians 9:26, 27</a>), he makes no reply. <span class="cmt_word">According to the commandments and teachings of men</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, LXX; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-9.htm">Matthew 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-7.htm">Mark 7:7</a>; ver. 8; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-20.htm">1 Corinthians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-5.htm">1 Corinthians 2:5, 13</a>); the only passage in this Epistle which distinctly alludes to the language of the Old Testament. But the words are, we may suppose, primarily a reminiscence of the language of Christ, who uses them in connection with his announcement of the abolition of the sacred distinctions of meats (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-1.htm">Mark 7:1-23</a>). This clause points out the method after which, and direction in which, the new teachers were leading their disciples, on the line of a man-made instead of a God given religion. "Commandments" (or, "injunctions") include the prescriptions of ver. 21 and all others like them; "teachings" embrace the general principles and doctrines on which these rules were based. So this expression, following "rudiments of the world (ver. 20), leads us back by a rapid generalization from the particulars specified in ver. 21 to the general starting point given in ver. 8 (see note), and prepares us for the brief and energetic summary of the whole Colossian error which we find in - <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Which things<p>Meats, drinks, etc.<p>Are to perish (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., are for corruption; destined for (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2;) Corruption, in the physical sense of decomposition.<p>With the using (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here in the New Testament.
