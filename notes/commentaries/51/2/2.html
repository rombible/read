When we not only believe with the heart, but are ready, when called, to make confession with the mouth. Knowledge and faith make a soul rich. The stronger our faith, and the warmer our love, the more will our comfort be. The treasures of wisdom are hid, not from us, but for us, in Christ. These were hid from proud unbelievers, but displayed in the person and redemption of Christ. See the danger of enticing words; how many are ruined by the false disguises and fair appearances of evil principles and wicked practices! Be aware and afraid of those who would entice to any evil; for they aim to spoil you. All Christians have, in profession at least, received Jesus Christ the Lord, consented to him, and taken him for theirs. We cannot be built up in Christ, or grow in him, unless we are first rooted in him, or founded upon him. Being established in the faith, we must abound therein, and improve in it more and more. God justly withdraws this benefit from those who do not receive it with thanksgiving; and gratitude for his mercies is justly required by God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That their hearts might be comforted - Like all other Christians in the times of the apostles, they were doubtless exposed to trials and persecutions.<p>Being knit together in love - The same word which is used here (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  sumbibazo&#772;) occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>, and is rendered compacted; see the notes at that place. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-22.htm">Acts 9:22</a>, it is rendered proving; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10</a>, assuredly gathering; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>, instruct; and here, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>, knit together. It means, properly, to make to come together, and hence, refers to a firm union, as where the heart of Christians are one. Here it means that the way of comforting each other was by solid Christian friendship, and that the means of cementing that was love. It was not by a mere outward profession, or by mere speculative faith; it was by a union of affection.<p>And unto all riches - On the meaning of the word "riches," as used by the apostle Paul, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>. There is a great energy of expression here. The meaning is, that the thing referred to - "the full understanding" of the "mystery" of religion - was an invaluable possession, like abundant wealth. This passage also shows the object for which they should be united. It should be in order that they might obtain this inestimable wealth. If they were divided in affections, and split up into factions, they could not hope to secure it.<p>Of the full assurance of understanding - This word (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  ple&#772;rophoria) means firm persuasion, settled conviction. It occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-11.htm">Hebrews 6:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>, and is rendered by assurance, or full assurance, in every instance. See the verb, however, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-5.htm">Romans 14:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>. It was the desire of the apostle that they might have entire conviction of the truth of the Christian doctrines.<p>To the acknowledgment - So as fully and openly to acknowledge or confess this mystery.<p>The mystery - On the meaning of this word, see the <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>, note. The meaning is, the doctrine respecting God, which had before been concealed or hidden, but which was now revealed in the gospel. It does not mean that there was any thing unintelligible or incomprehensible respecting this doctrine when it; was made known. That might be as clear as any other truth.<p>Of God - Of God as he actually subsists. This does not mean that the mere fact of the existence of God was a "mystery," or a truth which had been concealed, for that was not true. But the sense plainly is, that there were truths now made known in the gospel to mankind, about the mode of the divine existence, which had not before been disclosed; and this "mystery" he wished them to retain, or fully acknowledge. The "mystery," or the hitherto unrevealed truth, related to the fact that God subsisted in more persons than one, as "Father," and as "Christ."<p>And of the Father - Or, rather, "even of the Father;" for so the word &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  kai (and) is often used. The apostle does not mean that he wished them to acknowledge the hitherto unrevealed truth respecting "God' and another being called "the Father;" but respecting "God" as the "Father," or of God as" Father' and as "Christ."<p>And of Christ - As a person of the Godhead. What the apostle wished them to acknowledge was, the full revelation now made known respecting the essential nature of God, as the "Father," and as "Christ." In relation to this, they were in special danger of being corrupted by the prevalent philosophy, as it is in relation to this that error of Christian doctrine usually commences. It should be said, however, that there is great variety of reading in the mss. on this whole clause, and that many critics (see Rosenmuller) regard it as spurious. I do not see evidence that it is not genuine; and the strain of exhortation of the apostle seems to me to demand it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Translate, "That their hearts may be comforted." The "their," compared with "you" (Col 2:4), proves that in Col 2:1 the words, "have not seen my face in the flesh," is a general designation of those for whom Paul declares he has "conflict," including the particular species, "you (Colossians) and them at Laodicea." For it is plain, the prayer "that their hearts may be comforted," must include in it the Colossians for whom he expressly says, "I have conflict." Thus it is an abbreviated mode of expression for, "That your and their hearts may be comforted." Alford translates, "confirmed," or allows "comforted" in its original radical sense strengthened. But the Greek supports English Version: the sense, too, is clear: comforted with the consolation of those whom Paul had not seen, and for whom, in consequence, he strove in prayerful conflict the more fervently; inasmuch as we are more anxious in behalf of absent, than present, friends [Davenant]. Their hearts would be comforted by "knowing what conflict he had for" them, and how much he is interested for their welfare; and also by being released from doubts on learning from the apostle, that the doctrine which they had heard from Epaphras was true and certain. In writing to churches which he had instructed face to face, he enters into particular details concerning them, as a father directing his children. But to those among whom he had not been in person, he treats of the more general truths of salvation.<p>being&#8212;Translate as Greek in oldest manuscripts, "They being knit together."<p>in love&#8212;the bond and element of perfect knitting together; the antidote to the dividing schismatical effect of false doctrine.

It is a distinct Greek word from "knowledge," Col 2:3. Alford translates, "thorough &#8230; knowledge."

Here follow the reasons why the apostle had so great a conflict, on account of the above persons, and why he was so desirous they should know it; one is, the consolation of their hearts. The hearts of God's people often need comfort, by reason of indwelling sin, the temptations of Satan, the hidings of God's face, and afflictive providences; and by reason of false teachers, who greatly trouble them, unsettle their minds, weaken their faith, and fill them with doubts and perplexities, and which was the case with these churches: now the business of Gospel ministers is to comfort such; this is the commission they are sent with; the doctrines of the Gospel are calculated for this very purpose, such as full redemption, free justification, complete pardon of sin, peace and reconciliation; and the bent of their ministry is to comfort distressed minds, upon what account soever; and it must be a comfort to these churches, when they found that they were regarded by so great an apostle; and it might tend to confirm them in the doctrine they had received at first, and deliver them from the scruples the false apostles had injected into their minds, and so administer comfort to them, when they perceived that the apostle approved of the Gospel they had heard and embraced, and rejected the notions of the false teachers: <p>being knit together in love: as the members of an human body are, by joints and bands; as love is the bond of union between God and his people, Christ and his members, so between saints and saints; it is the cement that joins and keeps them together, and which edifies and builds them up, and whereby they increase with the increase of God; it makes them to be of one heart and one soul; it renders their communion with one another comfortable and delightful, and strengthens them against the common enemy, who is for dividing, and so destroying; and is what is the joy of Gospel ministers, and what they labour at and strive for, and which is another reason of the apostle's conflict: <p>and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding; that is, spiritual knowledge and understanding, or the understanding of spiritual things; for the understanding of things natural and civil is not designed; nor a mere notional knowledge of spiritual things, which persons may have, and yet not charity, or love, with which this is here joined; and such an one also, which is sure and certain: for as there is such a thing as the assurance of faith, and the assurance of hope, so likewise of understanding of the Gospel, and the truths of it; concerning which there ought to be no doubt, being to be received upon the credit of a divine testimony: moreover, such a knowledge and understanding of divine things is intended, as is large and abundant, signified by "all riches"; for though it is not complete and perfect in this life, yet it takes a vast compass, and reaches to all the deep things of God; to whatever relates to the person and grace of Christ; to all the things of the Spirit of God; to all the blessings and promises of the covenant of grace; to the riches both of grace and glory, to the things of time and eternity, and which is more clearly explained by the following clause: <p>to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; that is, to a greater and more perfect knowledge, approbation, and confession of the Gospel, which he had in the preceding chapter called the mystery; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>, and here "the mystery of God", which he is both the author and subject of: it is by him as the efficient cause, ordained by him, and hid in him before the world was; and it is of him, as the subject matter of it; not as the God of nature and providence, which the works of both declare; but as the God of all grace, as God in Christ, which is the peculiar discovery of the Gospel: and "of" him as "the Father" of Christ, which is not discoverable by the light of nature, nor known by natural reason, but is a point of divine revelation; and "of" him as the Father of his people by adoption; and of all his grace, in election to grace and glory; in predestination to sonship, and in the council and covenant of grace; in the scheme of salvation and redemption; in the mission of his Son, and the gift of him as a Saviour and Redeemer. The copulative "and" before "the Father", is left out in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, which read "the mystery of God the Father"; and with it, it may be rendered, as it sometimes is, God, "even the Father": though the word "God" may be considered essentially, and as after distinguished into two of the persons of the Godhead; "the Father" the first person, so called, in relation to his Son, which is no small part of the mystery of the Gospel; and "Christ" the second person, who is equally God with the Father; and the Spirit, who, though not mentioned, is not excluded from this adorable mystery: and which is the mystery "of Christ", he being both the efficient cause and the subject matter of it; it treats of his deity and personality; of his offices, as Mediator, prophet, priest, and King; of his incarnation and redemption; of his grace, righteousness, sacrifice, and satisfaction; of justification by him, pardon through him, and acceptance in him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> That <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;</span><p>(2) He concludes shortly the sum of the former doctrine, that is, that the whole sum of true wisdom, and most secret knowledge of God, consists in Christ alone, and that this is the use of it with regard to men, that they are knit together in love, and rest themselves happily in the knowledge of so great a goodness, until they come to fully enjoy it.<p>(b) Whom, he never says.<p>(c) Of that understanding, which brings forth a certain and undoubted persuasion in our minds.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/colossians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>.

The reading to be approved, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ Χριστοῦ</span> (see the critical remarks), means: <span class="ital">of the God of Christ</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">to whom Christ belongs</span> in a special way, as to His Father, Sender, Head, etc.; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm" title="And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?">Matthew 27:46</a>. The separation of <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span>, however, from <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>, and the taking it as apposition to <span class="greekheb">τοῦ μυστηρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, so that <span class="ital">Christ Himself</span> appears as the <span class="ital">personal secret of God</span>, “because He is personally the truth contained in God and revealed from God” (Hofmann, comp. Holtzmann, p. 215), must be rejected, because Paul would thus have expressed himself in a way as much exposed to misapprehension as possible. He would either have inserted an <span class="greekheb">ὅ ἐστι</span> after <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-11.htm" title="For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>), or have omitted <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, which would have made <span class="greekheb">τὸ μυστήριον Χριστοῦ</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-4.htm" title="Whereby, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)">Ephesians 3:4</a>, the mystery contained personally in Christ. But as the apostle has actually written, the reader could only understand the mystery <span class="ital">of the God of Christ</span>. If Christ is <span class="ital">God’s</span> (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-23.htm" title="And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-26.htm" title="And it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.">Luke 2:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-20.htm" title="He said to them, But whom say you that I am?

After <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>, therefore, no comma is to be inserted. Finally, the view of Hilary (“<span class="ital">Deus Christus</span> sacramentum est”), that <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεός</span> is <span class="ital">Christ Himself</span> (so Steiger and Bisping, also Philippi, <span class="ital">Glaubensl</span>. IV. 1, p. 460, ed. 2), is wholly without Pauline analogy, and is not to be supported by such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm" title="Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.">Romans 9:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm" title="Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;">Titus 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-5.htm" title="For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.">Ephesians 5:5</a>; in fact, even the lofty predicates employed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm" title=" For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.">Colossians 2:9</a>, draw the line of distinction between God and Christ. Moreover, the expression itself is not harsher (de Wette), or even more inconceivable (Olshausen), more unsuitable and obscure (Reiche), than the phrase <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ κυρίου ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ Χ</span>. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>; since in connection with the notion “the God of Christ,” the designation of the latter as our Lord is unessential. The addition <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span> <span class="ital">finds its motive</span> in the connection, because it was just <span class="ital">in Christ</span> that God formed the decree of redemption (the <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span>), and has carried it out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a> f., <span class="ital">et al</span>.). Whosoever has known God as the <span class="ital">God of Christ</span>, has the divine <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον</span> therewith unveiled to him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[78] So Hofmann, who couples it in this sense with <span class="greekheb">εἰς πᾶν τὸ πλοῦτος</span>, taking <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγάπῃ</span> adverbially, and explaining the <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, which stands in the way, in the sense of <span class="ital">“even,”</span> to the effect that this introduction into all riches of the <span class="ital">understanding</span> has as its presupposition <span class="ital">another</span> introduction, viz. that into the <span class="ital">faith.</span> This is a sophistically forced mode of disposing of the <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, suggested by nothing in the context, especially since faith by no means, either of itself or in vv. 5–7, falls to be considered as a <span class="ital">preliminary stage,</span> as if the <span class="greekheb">πληροφορία κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., like a <span class="ital">new</span> stadium, had to be entered upon through a <span class="ital">second</span> introduction; on the contrary, this <span class="greekheb">πληροφορία</span> is the full rich <span class="ital">development</span> of faith in the inner life. We may add that <span class="greekheb">συμβιβάζειν</span>=<span class="ital">to introduce</span> is nothing but a <span class="ital">lexicographical fiction</span> invented by Hofmann. Chrysostom already says rightly: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἑνωθῶσι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[79] Neither Greek authors, nor the LXX., nor the Apocrypha have <span class="greekheb">πληροφορία</span>. In Ptol. <span class="ital">Tetr.</span> p. 4. 9, <span class="greekheb">πληροφόρησις</span> is found.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[80] According to Holtzmann, p. 303, in the frequent mention of <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐπίγνωσις</span>, of <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span> and <span class="greekheb">σύνεσις</span>, of <span class="greekheb">γνωρίζειν</span> and <span class="greekheb">φωτίζειν</span>, of <span class="greekheb">μυστήριον ἀποκεκρυμμ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">φανέρωσις τοῦ μυστ</span>., we may detect already the terminology of the Grecian mysteries. As if these ideas and expressions were not sufficiently Pauline, and their intentional application were not sufficiently intelligible in the light of theosophic aberrations. Comp. also on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm" title=" If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;">Colossians 1:23</a>; and Weiss, <span class="ital">Bibl. Theol.</span> p. 420, <span class="ital">ed.</span> 2.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">παρακληθῶσιν</span>. It is disputed what meaning should be attached to this. Meyer, Ellicott and others translate “may be comforted”. This seems to be the more usual sense in Paul, and is supported by the addition “knit together in love,” which favours an emotional reference. It is more probable, however, that we should translate “may be strengthened” (De W., Alf., Kl[10], Ol., Sod.), for this was more needed than consolation in face of heresy. Oltramare quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-12.htm" title="That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.">Romans 1:12</a> (where, however, <span class="greekheb">συμπαρ</span>. is used), <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm" title="And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-17.htm" title="Comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good word and work.">2 Thessalonians 2:17</a>, where this verb is joined to <span class="greekheb">στηρίζειν</span> to show that this sense is Pauline, and in the latter we have <span class="greekheb">παρακαλέσαι ὑμῶν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καρδίας καὶ στηρίξαι</span>. Haupt, following Luther, thinks it means “may be warned,” but this does not suit <span class="greekheb">καρδίαι</span>, especially in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-8.htm" title=" Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;">Colossians 4:8</a>.—<span class="greekheb">αἱ καρδίαι αὐτῶν</span>. We might have expected <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>, but <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὅσοι</span>, while not excluding the Colossians, includes other Churches as well. <span class="greekheb">καρδία</span> implies more than our word “heart,” it embraces also the intellect and the will.—<span class="greekheb">συνβιβασθέντες</span> agrees with <span class="greekheb">αὐτοί</span>, understood as the equivalent of <span class="greekheb">αἱ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>. In the LXX the word means “to instruct” (so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm" title="For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>, which is a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-14.htm" title="With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?">Isaiah 40:14</a>). But joined to <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀγ</span>. it must have its usual sense, “knit together,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>. There may be a reference to the divisive tendencies of the false teaching.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰς πᾶν πλοῦτος τῆς πληροφορίας τῆς συνέσεως</span>: “and unto all riches of the fulness of understanding”. <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰς</span> is to be taken with <span class="greekheb">συνβιβ</span>., “knit together in order to attain”. <span class="greekheb">συνβιβ</span>. is a verb implying motion, and therefore is followed here by <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>. It is usual to take <span class="greekheb">πληροφ</span>. as “full assurance,” but the expression “all the riches of full assurance of understanding” has a strange redundance, which seems scarcely to be met, as Klöpper thinks, by De Wette’s remark that <span class="greekheb">πλοῦτ</span>. is a quantitative but <span class="greekheb">πληρ</span>. a qualitative expression. Accordingly it seems better, with Grimm and Haupt, to translate “fulness,” a sense which is possible everywhere in N.T. except <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>. For <span class="greekheb">συν</span>. see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>. Insight into Christian truth is meant here.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ μυστηρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span>. Probably this is in apposition to the previous clause, <span class="greekheb">εἰς πᾶν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., and further explains it; all the rich fulness of insight, which he trusts may be the fruit of their union in love, is nothing else than full knowledge of the Divine mystery, even Christ. The false teachers bid them seek knowledge in other sources than Christ, Paul insists on the contrary that full knowledge of the mystery of God is all the wealth of fulness of understanding, and is to be found in the knowledge of Christ alone. This makes it probable that the correct interpretation of the true reading is to take <span class="greekheb">Χριστοῦ</span> as in apposition to <span class="greekheb">μυστηρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ</span> (so Ell., Lightf., Findl., Hofm., Holtzmann, Haupt). It is true that this is curt and harsh, and that we should have expected <span class="greekheb">ὅ ἐστιν</span>, but it suits the context better than the translation “the mystery of the God of Christ” (Mey., Gess, Kl[11], Sod., Weiss and apparently Abb.). It is true that Paul uses a similar expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>. But here it would emphasise the subordination of Christ, which is precisely what is out of place in a passage setting forth His all-sufficiency, and against a doctrine the special peril of which lay in its tendency to under-estimate both the Person and the Work of Christ. The grammatically possible apposition of <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> (Hilary) is out of the question. Christ is the mystery of God, since in Him God’s eternal purpose of salvation finds its embodiment.

Lightfoot in a long and careful note (pp. 318, 319) reasons for the high probability of reading (<span class="ital">b</span>), and for regarding all others as formed from it either by explanatory addition or by cutting a knot of supposed difficulty by omission. Dr Scrivener (<span class="ital">Introd. to N.T. Criticism</span>, pp. 634–6) also discusses the case, with Lightfoot’s reasoning among other things before him, and inclines to the same <span class="ital">reading</span>, though apparently preferring the other <span class="ital">rendering</span> given above. His only difficulty lies in the small documentary support given to a reading in itself otherwise so likely. And he says, “The more we think over this reading, the more it grows upon us, as the source from which all the rest are derived. At present, perhaps, [‘<span class="ital">of God the Father of Christ</span>’] may be looked upon as the most strongly attested, … but a very small weight might suffice to turn the critical scale.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Adopting the reading thus accepted by Lightfoot and favoured by Scrivener, how shall we render it? Shall we say, “<span class="ital">the mystery of the God Christ</span>”? The phrase would convey eternal truth; but <span class="ital">as a phrase</span> it has no precise parallel in St Paul. To him Christ is indeed absolutely Divine, Coequal in Nature with the Father; but this truth is always seen, so to speak, through His Sonship, so that He is designated rather “the Son of God” than simply “God.” (See however <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-13.htm" title="Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ;">Titus 2:13</a>.)

In the best Greek copies "drawn together" is nominative masculine, agreeing with "they," the logical subject implied in "their <span class="accented">hearts"</span> (feminine). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> has the same sense in ver. 19 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a> it is quoted from the LXX in another sense; and it has a variety of meanings in the Acts. "Drawn together" expresses the double sense which accrues to the verb in combination with the two prepositions "in" and "into:" "united <span class="accented">in</span> love," Christians are prepared to be "led <span class="accented">into</span> all the wealth of Divine knowledge." This combination of "love and knowledge" appears in all St. Paul's letters of this period (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>; and contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1, 2, 8-13</a>). "The riches of the full assurance," etc., and "the knowledge of the mystery" are the counterpart of "the riches of the glory of the mystery," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>; the fulness of conviction and completeness of knowledge attainable by the Christian correspond to the full and satisfying character of the revelation he receives in Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-19</a>). (On "understanding," see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>.) "Full assurance," or "conviction" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), is a word belonging to St. Luke and St. Paul (with the Epistle to the Hebrews) in the New Testament (not found in classical Greek), and denotes radically "a bringing to fall measure or maturity." Combined with "understanding," it denotes the ripe, intelligent persuasion of one who enters into the whole wealth of the "truth as it is in Jesus" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm">Colossians 4:12</a>, R.V.; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-21.htm">Romans 4:21</a> and Romans 14:5, for corresponding verb). In this inward "assurance," as in a fortress, the Colossians were to entrench themselves against the attacks of error (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm">Colossians 3:15</a>, and notes). <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is either in explanatory apposition to the previous clause, or rather donors the <span class="accented">further purpose</span> for which this wealth of conviction is to be sought: "knowledge of the Divine mystery, knowledge of Christ"  - this is the supreme end, ever leading on and upward, for the pursuit of which all strengthening of heart and understanding are given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). The Revisers have corrected the erroneous "acknowledgment" by their paraphrastic rendering, "that they may know." (On <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (comp. <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 3), see note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>.) The object of this knowledge is the great <span class="accented">manifested mystery</span> of God, namely <span class="accented">Christ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). We confidently accept here the Revised reading, that of nearly all recent textual critics, which omits the words found in the Received Text between "God" and "Christ." There are extant eleven distinct variations of this reading, and that of the Textus Receptus is, to all appearance, the latest and worst; "the passage is altogether an instructive lesson on textual criticism" (Lightfoot, pp. 252, 253; also Westcott and Hort, 'Introduction: Notes on Selected Readings,' pp. 125, 126). The words thus read have been interpreted mystery of the God Christ" (the Latin Hilary, and a few moderns); of the God of Christ" (Meyer, quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>); - both interpretations grammatically correct, but unsuitable here, even if in harmony with Pauline usage elsewhere. Alford omits "of Christ" altogether, distrusting the textual evidence.
