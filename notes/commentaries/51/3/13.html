Those who are the elect of God, holy and beloved, ought to be lowly and compassionate towards all. While in this world, where there is so much corruption in our hearts, quarrels will sometimes arise. But it is our duty to forgive one another, imitating the forgiveness through which we are saved. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts; it is of his working in all who are his. Thanksgiving to God, helps to make us agreeable to all men. The gospel is the word of Christ. Many have the word, but it dwells in them poorly; it has no power over them. The soul prospers, when we are full of the Scriptures and of the grace of Christ. But when we sing psalms, we must be affected with what we sing. Whatever we are employed about, let us do every thing in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in believing dependence on him. Those who do all in Christ's name, will never want matter of thanksgiving to God, even the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forbearing one another - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a>.<p>And forgiving one another - Notes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-14.htm">Matthew 6:14</a>.<p>If any man have a quarrel against any - Margin, "or complaint."

(On "bearing with" or "forbearing," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-19.htm">2 Corinthians 11:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-17.htm">Matthew 17:17</a>.) It is ascribed to God, with "long-suffering," especially as shown in his dealing with the sins of men before the coming of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-26.htm">Romans 3:26</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>). <span class="accented">Long suffering</span> may be shown towards all who do us injury; <span class="accented">forbearance</span> especially towards those from whom regard or obedience is due. It falls short of <span class="accented">forgiveness</span>, which can only ensue on repentance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-3.htm">Luke 17:3, 4</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-30.htm">Acts 17:30</a>). The change of pronoun in the two participial clauses appears also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-2.htm">Ephesians 4:2</a> and 32: the first is reciprocal, but the second is reflexive, implying the <span class="accented">oneness</span> of the forgiving and the forgiven party. Forgiving a Christian brother, it is as though a man were forgiving himself (comp. vers. 14, 15; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5-7</a>; and the same variation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8-10</a>). "Forgive" is literally "to grant grace," used of Divine forgiveness m <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a> (see note). The words, "if any have any complaint," etc., would certainly apply to Philemon as against Onesimus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-18.htm">Philemon 1:18, 19</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-5.htm">2 Corinthians 2:5-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-25.htm">Mark 11:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even as the Lord</span> (or, <span class="accented">Christ</span>) <span class="cmt_word">forgave you, so also ye</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-38.htm">Acts 13:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-1.htm">Matthew 9:1-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-27.htm">Matthew 18:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-3.htm">Psalm 103:3</a>). This argument is latent in the appeal to the "elect" and "beloved" of ver. 12. The evidence for the alternative readings, "Lord" and "Christ," is nearly equal in weight. In any case, the "Lord" is "Christ" in this passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17, 24</a>): and that <span class="accented">he</span> forgave (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, note) is quite consistent with the assertion that <span class="accented">God</span> forgave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13</a>), for God forgave "in Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>). So "God in Christ reconciled" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>); and yet "Christ reconciled us" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>). "Forgiving," supplied in thought from previous context, completes the sense of "so also ye" (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott). To suppose an ellipsis of the imperative, with Light foot and the English Version ("do ye"), is needlessly to break the structure of the sentence. Ver. 14 shows that the leading imperative, "put on," of ver. 12 is still in the writer's mind. For the reciprocal double <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> ("even.., also"), comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a> or <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; it is characteristic of the writer. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>One another - one another (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  - &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., one another - yourselves. For a similar variation of the pronoun see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8-10</a>. The latter pronoun emphasizes the fact that they are all members of Christ's body - everyone members one of another - so that, in forgiving each other they forgive themselves.<p>Quarrel (&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here in the New Testament. Cause of blame. Rev., complaint. The A.V. uses quarrel in its earlier sense of cause of complaint. So Shakespeare:<p>"The lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you."<p>"Much Ado," ii., 1.<p>"Against whom comest thou, and what's thy quarrel?"<p>"Richard II.," i., 3, 33.<p>Holinshed: "He thought he had a good quarrel to attack him." It was used of a plaintiff's action at law, like the Latin querela.</body></html>
