Of the new nature there are two marks—towards man love in all its various forms, towards God thanksgiving and living to His glory.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">The new man, which is</span> (<span class= "ital">being</span>) <span class= "bld">renewed.</span>—There are here the same two different words which are found in the parallel passage.

Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or vermin which spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must be made to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnal indulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love of present good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortify sins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospel changes the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite and passion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions and circumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, because Christ is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which is renewed in knowledge - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>, it is said that the new man is "created after God in righteousness and true holiness." In this place it is added that to the renewed soul knowledge is imparted, and it is made in that respect as man was when he was first created. This passage, in connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>, proves that before man fell he was endowed with "righteousness, true holiness, and knowledge." The knowledge here referred to, is not the knowledge of everything, but the knowledge of God. Man was acquainted with his Creator. He resembled him in his capacity for knowledge. He was an intelligent being, and he had an acquaintance with the divine existence and perfections; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>. But especially had he that knowledge which is the fear of the Lord; that knowledge of God which is the result of love. Piety, in the Scriptures, is often represented as the "knowledge" of God; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm">Ephesians 3:19</a>.<p>After the image of him that created him - So as to resemble God.

Here (neon) the Greek, means "the recently-put-on nature"; that lately received at regeneration (see on [2426]Eph 4:23, 24).<p>which is renewed&#8212;Greek, "which is being renewed" (anakainottmenou); namely, its development into a perfectly renewed nature is continually progressing to completion.<p>in knowledge&#8212;rather as the Greek, "unto perfect knowledge" (see on [2427]Col 1:6; [2428]Col 1:9, 10). Perfect knowledge of God excludes all sin (Joh 17:3).<p>after the image of him that created him&#8212;namely, of God that created the new man (Eph 2:10; 4:24). The new creation is analogous to the first creation (2Co 4:6). As man was then made in the image of God naturally, so now spiritually. But the image of God formed in us by the Spirit of God, is as much more glorious than that borne by Adam, as the Second Man, the Lord from heaven, is more glorious than the first man. Ge 1:26, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." The "image" is claimed for man, 1Co 11:7; the "likeness," Jas 3:9. Origen [On First Principles, 3:6] taught, the image was something in which all were created, and which continued to man after the fall (Ge 9:6). The likeness was something towards which man was created, that he might strive after it and attain it. Trench thinks God in the double statement (Ge 1:26), contemplates both man's first creation and his being "renewed in knowledge after the image of Him that created Him."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And have put on the new man:</span> (To see number 1: <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9</a>"</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

And the more it is so—the more fully it has developed itself in accordance with the divine ideal—the more is it also the determining power and the living practical agent of the whole conduct, so that all those vices enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-8.htm" title=" But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.">Colossians 3:8</a> are excluded by it, and even become morally impossible.

The <span class="greekheb">κατʼ εἰκόνα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is usually connected with <span class="greekheb">ἀνακαινούμ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἐπίγν</span>. taken by itself, in connection with which Steiger, Huther, de Wette, and Bleek (comp. also Ewald) arbitrarily adopt the view, that the prominent mention of the knowledge was occasioned by a polemic opposition to the false teachers and their tendencies to false <span class="ital">gnosis</span>.

The expression of this definition <span class="ital">in this particular way</span> comes very naturally to Paul, because he is speaking of the homo <span class="ital">recens creatus</span>, in connection with which, after the analogy of the creation of Adam, the idea of the image of God naturally floated before his mind,—the image which that first-created man <span class="ital">had</span>, and which the <span class="ital">recens creatus</span> is <span class="ital">to attain and present</span> by way of copy in that towards which he is being developed, in the <span class="greekheb">ἐπίγνωσις</span>.

See further, our note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is renewed</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">is being renewed</span>; a present not aorist participle.—In the parallel place in Eph. “the new man” “<span class="ital">was created</span>,” as a definite fact; here he is continuously “<span class="ital">being renewed</span>,” maintained as it were by a continuous creative act. (Cp. for the verb in a kindred context, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>.)—Practically, the thought is of the believer’s maintained union with His Lord, and his realization in that union of continued peace and spiritual power. As if the Head, for the member, were evermore “made new,” and so always newly reflected and as it were reproduced in the member.—Lightfoot compares, in contrast, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>; “the old man is <span class="ital">being corrupted</span>, is <span class="ital">decaying</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in knowledge</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">unto knowledge</span>. The daily “renewal” is such as to result continually in the regenerate man’s spiritual vision of Christ, intimacy with Him, insight into His will.—On the word <span class="ital">epignôsis</span>, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">after the image of him that created him</span>] I.e., so as to be like God, who “created,” constituted, the new creation as He did the old. Cp. the close parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth....">Genesis 1:26-27</a>; a passage no doubt in St Paul’s mind here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reference is to the Father, not the Son, as the Creator; cp. the parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>, “created <span class="ital">after God</span>;” and the place in Genesis. He is the eternal Original; “the new man” realizes his ideal in likeness to Him, generated by communion with Him in Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Even here, we think, may be traced reverently an allusion to Christ as “the Second Man.” He, truly, is not “<span class="ital">created</span>” as to His Being and Person, which is necessary and eternal; but as Son of Man, and as Head of His Church, in respect of His Work and Office, Scripture represents Him as the willing Result of the Father’s will. In this respect He, as well as His followers in Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-10.htm" title="For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.">Ephesians 2:10</a>), “lives because of the Father” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-57.htm" title="As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.">John 6:57</a>). But while this reference lies, as we think, in the depths of the passage, its manifest practical import is that the regenerate member of the blessed Head needs and receives daily “renewal by his Holy Spirit,” leading to a fuller knowledge of, and so a truer likeness to, the Father of Jesus Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The suggestion that “the image” is in fact Christ, (so Chrysostom; cp. above <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>) is not likely in view of the parallel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>, with its simple phrase “according <span class="ital">to God</span>.” See Lightfoot’s note.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/colossians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸν νέον τὸν ἀνακαινούμενον</span>, <span class="ital">the new man renewed</span>) lb., <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-24.htm" title=" Knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ.">Colossians 3:24</a>, note.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν</span>, <span class="ital">to</span> [or <span class="ital">in</span>] <span class="ital">knowledge</span>) of the truth (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-6.htm" title=" Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:">Colossians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;...">Colossians 1:9-10</a>), by which all love of lying is destroyed.—<span class="greekheb">κατʼ εἰκόνα</span>, <span class="ital">according to the image</span>) This image consists in perfect truth.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ κτίσαντος αὐτον</span>, <span class="ital">of Him that created him</span> [viz. <span class="ital">the new man</span>]) <span class="ital">i.e.</span> of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a> : compare ib., ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>.

"Being renewed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, derived from the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) sets forth the other side of this newness, its <span class="accented">novelty</span> of quality and condition (compare "newness of life," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>). And this participle is in the present tense (continuous), while the former is in the aorist (historical). So the notions are combined of <span class="accented">a new birth</span> taking place once for all, and a new <span class="accented">character</span> in course of formation. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-23.htm">Ephesians 4:23, 24</a> these ideas are in the same order (see Trench's 'Synonyms'). "Full knowledge" was one purpose of this renewal, the purpose most necessary to be set before the Colossians.

"After (the) image" is clearly an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-28</a>; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a> ("after God"). It is adverbial to "renewed," not to "knowledge." Man's renewal in Christ makes him what the Creator at first designed him to be, namely, his own image (compare note on "reconcile," <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>). Chrysostom and others take "Christ" as "him that created," in view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 16</a>; but then it is said that all things "were created <span class="accented">in</span>...  <span class="accented">through</span>...  <span class="accented">for</span> Christ," not absolutely that <span class="accented">Christ created</span> them.
