Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or vermin which spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must be made to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnal indulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love of present good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortify sins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospel changes the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite and passion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions and circumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, because Christ is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But now ye also put off all these - All these which follow, as being also inconsistent with the Christian calling.<p>Anger, wrath - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a>.<p>Malice - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31</a>.<p>Blasphemy - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-3.htm">Matthew 9:3</a>.
