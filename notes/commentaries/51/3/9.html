Mortify them, kill them, suppress them, as weeds or vermin which spread and destroy all about them. Continual opposition must be made to all corrupt workings, and no provision made for carnal indulgences. Occasions of sin must be avoided: the lusts of the flesh, and the love of the world; and covetousness, which is idolatry; love of present good, and of outward enjoyments. It is necessary to mortify sins, because if we do not kill them, they will kill us. The gospel changes the higher as well as the lower powers of the soul, and supports the rule of right reason and conscience, over appetite and passion. There is now no difference from country, or conditions and circumstances of life. It is the duty of every one to be holy, because Christ is a Christian's All, his only Lord and Saviour, and all his hope and happiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Lie not one to another - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>.<p>Seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds - Your former corrupt and evil nature; Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>. The reason for putting away lying, stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>, is, that we "are members one of another" - or are brethren. The reason assigned here is, that we have put off the old man with his deeds. The sense is, that lying is one of the fruits of sin. It is that which the corrupt nature of man naturally produces; and when that is put off, then all that that nature produces should be also put off with it. The vice of lying is a universal fruit of sin, and seems to exist everywhere where the gospel does not prevail; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>. There is, perhaps, no single form of sin that reigns so universally in the pagan world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

Some, as Beza, think, that here is an allusion to the rite of baptism in the primitive church; which, as he truly observes, was performed not by aspersion, but immersion; and which required a putting off, and a putting on of clothes, and when the baptized persons professed to renounce the sins of the flesh, and their former conversation, and to live a new life. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Lie not one to another, <span class="cverse3">{7}</span> seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</span><p>(7) A definition of our new birth taken from the parts of it, which are the putting off of the old man, that is to say, of the wickedness which is in us by nature, and the restoring and repairing of the new man, that is to say, of the pureness which is given us by grace.

Accordingly, the <span class="ital">aorist</span> participles are not <span class="ital">synchronous</span> with the foregoing (<span class="ital">exuentes</span>, etc., so Vulgate, Luther, Calovius, and others, including Flatt, Olshausen, Huther, de Wette, Ewald, and Bleek), but <span class="ital">precede</span> it; they are not included in the exhortation, for which reason <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-6.htm" title="Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:">1 Peter 5:6</a> f. is inappropriately appealed to, but <span class="ital">assign a ground</span> for it. This is clear, even in a linguistic point of view, from the fact that <span class="greekheb">ψεύδεσθε</span> is the <span class="ital">present;</span> and also, as regards the sense, from the circumstance that if the words be regarded as part of the exhortation itself, as a definition of the mode of what is required, the <span class="ital">exuentes</span> only, and not the <span class="ital">induentes</span>, would correspond with the requirement to lay aside and to abstain from lying. Besides, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a> is inappropriate as a constituent part of an exhortation, but suits well as an argumentative enlargement. Finally, the assumed figurative exhortation only comes in expressly at <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>, and that by way of inference (<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>) from what had been said previously from <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδυσάμ</span>. onwards in the same figure, though not yet in paraenetic form. Without any sufficient reason, and out of harmony with the simple paraenetic form of the entire context, Hofmann begins with <span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδυσάμ</span>. a new period, whose protasis ends in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a>, and whose apodosis begins with <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a> (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm" title="Behold, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and make your boast of God,">Romans 2:17</a> ff.); by this we gain only a more clumsy complication of the discourse, especially as the supposed apodosis has again participial definitions.

The imperative changes its tense from aorist to present, the exhortation to the decisive act being followed by a rule for their daily life. <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> expresses the direction of the utterance. It should not be translated “against” (Kl[19], Fr.).—<span class="greekheb">ἀπεκδυσάμενοι</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐνδυσάμενοι</span>. These participles may be translated as part of the exhortation, “lie not one to another putting off … and putting on,” in other words, “put off … and put on … and lie not”. Or they may give a reason for the exhortation, “lie not, seeing ye have put off … and put on”. In favour of the former is the addition <span class="greekheb">σὺν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτ</span>., for if the practices had been put off at conversion the warning might seem superfluous. <span class="greekheb">ἀνακαιν</span>. (pres.) also points to a continuous process. Either view harmonises with Paul’s theology, for he speaks of death to the old and life to the new either as ideally complete in the moment of conversion or as realised gradually in actual experience. But the latter, which is taken by most commentators, is preferable; for the reference is much wider than in the foregoing words. They refer only to the discarding of vices. Paul now emphasises the positive side also, the putting on the new as well as casting off the old.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν παλαιὸν ἄνθρωπον</span>: <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the old non-Christian self (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-6.htm" title="Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.">Romans 6:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-22.htm" title="That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;">Ephesians 4:22</a>).—<span class="greekheb">πράξεσιν</span>: “practices,” such as those already enumerated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[19] Klöpper.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Lie not</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-25.htm" title="Why putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.">Ephesians 4:25</a>. Entire truthfulness is an essential Christian characteristic, for Christ is “the Truth.” In the light of His words and deeds it is certain that nothing untruthful, not even the most “pious” of “frauds,” can possibly be holy.—The uniform emphasis on truthfulness in the precepts of Scripture is the more significant of the origin of Scripture when we remember the proverbial Oriental laxity about truth.

In Romans it is a thing which “was crucified with Christ.”—It may be explained as “<span class="ital">the old state</span>,” the state of the unregenerate son of Adam, guilty under the sentence of the eternal law, and morally the slave of sin. To “take off” the old Man is to quit that position, stepping, in Christ, into the position of acceptance and of spiritual power and liberty.—“<span class="ital">The old Man</span>” is thus not identical with “the flesh,” which is an abiding element (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-16.htm" title="This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh....">Galatians 5:16-17</a>) in the regenerate, though it need never be the ruling element.—The phrases “old Man” and “new Man” have a probable inner reference to the First and Second Adam respectively (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:...">Romans 5:12-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-21.htm" title="For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.">1 Corinthians 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit....">1 Corinthians 15:45-49</a>). The “<span class="ital">taking off</span>” and “<span class="ital">putting on</span>” here may be explained as meaning, practically, “you broke connexion (of guilt and helplessness) with the First Adam, and formed connexion (of acceptance and of life) with the Second.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">with his deeds</span>] See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-13.htm" title="For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.">Romans 8:13</a>, for the same Greek word; “<span class="ital">the practices, machinations</span> of the body.” And cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-18.htm" title="And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.">Acts 19:18</a>.—“The old Man” is, so to speak, the parent of “the deceitfulness of sin” in all its phases; connexion with “the new Man” is the death-blow to it, as the anxious conscience is set at rest, the relation of the believer to God wholly altered, and a spiritual force not his own given to him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/colossians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-9.htm" title=" Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;">Colossians 3:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μὴ ψεύδεσθε</span>, <span class="ital">Lie not</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-25.htm" title="Why putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.">Ephesians 4:25</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>) <span class="ital">to</span>, or <span class="ital">against</span>.

The imperatives of vers. 5 and 8 were aorists, enjoining a single, decisive act; this is present, as in vers. 1, 2, 15, 18, etc., giving a rule of life. Only in Colossians and Ephesians do we find the apostle give a general warning against <span class="accented">lying.</span> What reason there was for this we cannot tell; unless it lay in the <span class="accented">deceit</span> of the heretical teachers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-2.htm">1 Timothy 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">Revelation 3:9</a>). The <span class="accented">lying</span> in question is uttered within the Church ("to one another"), and is fatal to its unity (ver. 11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28-30</a>). The following aorist participles, "having stripped off" and "having put on" (ver. 10), may, grammatically, be part of the <span class="accented">command</span> - "strip off," etc., and "lie not" - as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>; or may state the <span class="accented">fact</span> on which that command is based. The latter view is preferable (Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, English Version; but see Lightfoot); for the participles describe a change already realized - a change <span class="accented">of principle</span>, which has, however, still to be more fully carried out in <span class="accented">practice</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11-13, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1, 3, 7, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-20.htm">Ephesians 4:20-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27, 28</a>): in ver. 12 the imperative mood is resumed with an emphatic "therefore," implying a previous reference to fact. (On the double compound <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "having stripped off (and put) away," see notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11, 15</a>.) The "Old man"; is the former self, the "I no longer living" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>) of the Colossian believer, to whom "the members that are upon the earth" (ver. 5) belonged - the entire sinful personality of "him who is in the flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-8.htm">Romans 8:8</a>).
