We must never separate the privileges and duties of the gospel. Submission is the duty of wives. But it is submission, not to a severe lord or stern tyrant, but to her own husband, who is engaged to affectionate duty. And husbands must love their wives with tender and faithful affection. Dutiful children are the most likely to prosper. And parents must be tender, as well as children obedient. Servants are to do their duty, and obey their masters' commands, in all things consistent with duty to God their heavenly Master. They must be both just and diligent; without selfish designs, or hypocrisy and disguise. Those who fear God, will be just and faithful when from under their master's eye, because they know they are under the eye of God. And do all with diligence, not idly and slothfully; cheerfully, not discontented at the providence of God which put them in that relation. And for servants' encouragement, let them know, that in serving their masters according to the command of Christ, they serve Christ, and he will give them a glorious reward at last. But, on the other hand, he who doeth wrong, shall receive for the wrong which he hath done. God will punish the unjust, as well as reward the faithful servant; and the same if masters wrong their servants. For the righteous Judge of the earth will deal justly between master and servant. Both will stand upon a level at his tribunal. How happy would true religion make the world, if it every where prevailed, influenced every state of things, and every relation of life! But the profession of those persons who are regardless of duties, and give just cause for complaint to those they are connected with, deceives themselves, as well as brings reproach on the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Servants, obey in all things ... - ; see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

Ground of <span class="ital">encouragement</span> (<span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, see the critical remarks) to fulfil the precept <span class="greekheb">τῷ κυρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δουλεύετε</span>: <span class="ital">for he who does wrong shall carry off</span> (the penal recompense of) <span class="ital">what wrong he has done</span>,—a <span class="ital">locus communis</span>, of which the slaves were to make the <span class="ital">application</span>, that the unjust treatment which <span class="ital">they</span> experienced from their <span class="ital">masters</span> would not go unpunished; hence they could not but feel themselves the more encouraged to be in their relation of servitude slaves of no other than <span class="ital">Christ</span>, and to permit no unjust treatment to make them deviate from that principle. Paul therefore adds for their further encouragement:[166] <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἔστι προσωποληψία</span>, <span class="ital">and there is no partiality</span>, of which likewise general proposition the intended application is, that in that requital the impartial Judge (Christ, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-24.htm" title=" Knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ.">Colossians 3:24</a>) will not favour the masters, and will not injure the slaves, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm" title="And, you masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.">Ephesians 6:9</a>. The correct view is held substantially by Theodoret, Beza, Calvin, Estius, Zachariae, Ewald, and others. Others have understood <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀδικῶν</span> as referring to the <span class="ital">slave</span> who violates his duty, in which case <span class="greekheb">ἀδικεῖν</span> is taken either in the strict sense of the <span class="ital">trespass of him</span> who <span class="ital">intentionally injures</span> his master (Hofmann, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-18.htm" title="If he has wronged you, or owes you ought, put that on my account;">Philemon 1:18</a>), or loosely and generally in the sense of <span class="ital">doing wrong</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-11.htm" title="He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.">Revelation 22:11</a> (Chrysostom, Theophylact, Bengel, Heinrichs, Storr, Flatt, Steiger, and others). But against this view the <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔστι προσωπολ</span>. may be decisively urged, which assumes that the subject to be punished is <span class="ital">higher</span>, of superior rank; for the idea which has been imported into the passage is purely fanciful: “Tenues saepe putant, sibi propter tenuitatem ipsorum esse parcendum; id negatur,” Bengel, in connection with which Theophylact appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm" title="You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: you shall not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor.">Leviticus 19:15</a>. And if on account of <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔστι προσωπολ</span>. the unjust <span class="ital">masters</span> must be taken as meant by <span class="greekheb">ὁ αδικῶν</span> in the application of the sentence, the reference to <span class="ital">both</span> parties, to the masters <span class="ital">and the slaves</span> (Erasmus, Grotius, and others, including Bähr, Huther, Baumgarten-Crusius, and Bleek, following Jerome and Pelagius), is thereby excluded, since <span class="greekheb">προσωπολ</span>. is appropriate <span class="ital">only</span> to the masters.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κομίσεται</span>] <span class="ital">shall carry off for himself</span> (sibi), refers to the Messianic judgment, and <span class="greekheb">ἠδίκησε</span> to that which he, who is now <span class="greekheb">ἀδικῶν</span> (<span class="ital">present), has</span> (shall have) then done. On the expression <span class="greekheb">κομίζεσθαι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., used to express the idea of a recompense equivalent to the deed in respect of its guilt, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-8.htm" title="Knowing that whatever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.">Ephesians 6:8</a>, and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Respecting <span class="greekheb">προσωποληψία</span>, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-6.htm" title="But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God accepts no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:">Galatians 2:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[166] Hofmann finds it incredible that Paul should have closed the section referring to the slaves with a proposition couched in such general terms as ver. 25, which applies <span class="ital">not to the slaves,</span> but to the <span class="ital">masters.</span> This, however, is an erroneous view. For in vv. 22–24 the apostle has instructed the slaves regarding their <span class="ital">active</span> bearing in service, and he is now, in the general proposition of ver. 25, suggesting for their reflection and deliberate consideration the proper soothing and elevating point of view regarding their <span class="ital">passive</span> bearing in service also. Thus ver. 25 also applies to the <span class="ital">slaves,</span> and forms merely the <span class="ital">transition</span> to the precept for the masters in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-1.htm" title=" Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.">Colossians 4:1</a>. This applies also in opposition to the doubts expressed by Holtzmann, p. 44 f.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-25.htm" title=" But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done: and there is no respect of persons.">Colossians 3:25</a>. This verse provides the reason (<span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>) for <span class="greekheb">δουλεύετε</span>. It is disputed whether <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀδ</span>. means the master who treats his slave unjustly, or the slave who by his idleness wrongs his master. To include both (Lightf., Findl., Ol.) is highly questionable, not only because a double reference is on principle to be avoided in exegesis, but because the connexion with <span class="greekheb">δουλ</span>. implies that one side of the relation only is being dealt with. It is commonly thought that the verse is an encouragement to the slave, based on the assurance that the master who ill treats him will receive his recompense in due course. In favour of this <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔστιν προσωπ</span>. is urged, since it implies that they are in a social position which might influence earthly courts, but cannot mitigate the judgment of God. But while a Christian writer could dissuade from vengeance by the thought that vengeance belonged to God alone, it is not credible that Paul should console the slave or encourage him in his duty by the thought that for every wrong he received his master would have to suffer. And, as Haupt says, we should have expected <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> after <span class="greekheb">ἀδικῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>. There is also a presumption in favour of an exhortation to the slave here. If it referred to the masters it would have come more naturally after <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-1.htm" title=" Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.">Colossians 4:1</a>. Nor does <span class="greekheb">προσωπ</span>. necessarily imply that the wrongdoer is socially more highly placed. It equally well applies to favouritism that might be expected from God on the ground of religious position. So we should interpret the verse (with Weiss and Haupt) as a warning to the Christian slave not to presume on his Christianity, so as to think that God will overlook his misdeeds or idleness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/colossians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">But he that doeth wrong</span>] The spiritual emancipation of the slave writes the law of duty on his heart.—The case of Onesimus was surely in the Apostle’s mind throughout this passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall receive</span>] from the Divine Master and Judge; the next words, with their parallel in Ephesians, fix the reference.

"For" is replaced by "but" in the same inferior copies which insert it in the last sentence.

"Equity is the mother of Justice" (Philo, 'On the Creation of Magistrates,' &sect; 14; see other illustrations in Lightfoot).

Moral equity, as realized by the Christian consciousness, was sure in course of time to bring about legal equality. Knowing that ye also have a Lord in heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-9.htm">Romans 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). (On "knowing," see ver. 24 a.) "Ye also," for Christ is "both their Lord and yours" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>, Revised Text). The lordship of Christ dominates the whole Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6, 10, 19</a>, etc.). The assertion that the proud master who deemed his fellow man his chattel is himself a mere <span class="accented">slave</span> of Christ, sets Christ's authority in a vivid and striking light. This consideration makes the Christian master apprehensive as to his treatment of his dependents. <span class="accented">He</span> is "in heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm">John 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>), the seat of Divine authority and glory, whence he shall soon return to judgment (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-8.htm">Psalm 76:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/colossians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>He that doeth wrong (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Compare Plm 1:18. The reference is primarily to the slave; but the following clause extends it to the master. If the slave do wrong, he shall be punished; but the master who does wrong will not be excused, for there is no respect of persons.

In the Old Testament it has, more commonly, a good sense, of kindly reception, favorable regard.
