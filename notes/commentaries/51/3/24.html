We must never separate the privileges and duties of the gospel. Submission is the duty of wives. But it is submission, not to a severe lord or stern tyrant, but to her own husband, who is engaged to affectionate duty. And husbands must love their wives with tender and faithful affection. Dutiful children are the most likely to prosper. And parents must be tender, as well as children obedient. Servants are to do their duty, and obey their masters' commands, in all things consistent with duty to God their heavenly Master. They must be both just and diligent; without selfish designs, or hypocrisy and disguise. Those who fear God, will be just and faithful when from under their master's eye, because they know they are under the eye of God. And do all with diligence, not idly and slothfully; cheerfully, not discontented at the providence of God which put them in that relation. And for servants' encouragement, let them know, that in serving their masters according to the command of Christ, they serve Christ, and he will give them a glorious reward at last. But, on the other hand, he who doeth wrong, shall receive for the wrong which he hath done. God will punish the unjust, as well as reward the faithful servant; and the same if masters wrong their servants. For the righteous Judge of the earth will deal justly between master and servant. Both will stand upon a level at his tribunal. How happy would true religion make the world, if it every where prevailed, influenced every state of things, and every relation of life! But the profession of those persons who are regardless of duties, and give just cause for complaint to those they are connected with, deceives themselves, as well as brings reproach on the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/colossians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Servants, obey in all things ... - ; see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/colossians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. the reward of the inheritance&#8212;"Knowing that it is from the Lord (the ultimate source of reward), ye shall receive the compensation (or recompense, which will make ample amends for your having no earthly possession as slaves now) consisting of the inheritance" (a term excluding the notion of meriting it by works: it is all of grace, Ro 4:14; Ga 3:18).<p>for ye serve&#8212;The oldest manuscripts omit "for," then translate as Vulgate, "Serve ye the Lord Christ;" compare Col 3:23, "To the Lord and not unto men" (1Co 7:22, 23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/colossians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Knowing, </span> being fully persuaded of this undoubted truth, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that of the Lord, </span> who superintends all your services, (not for any merit of yours), <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-8.htm" title="Knowing that whatever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.">Ephesians 6:8</a></span>, the recompence which your Master in heaven hath purchased, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>,18</span>, shall be freely settled upon you whom he hath adopted into his family, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-7.htm" title="Why you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.">Galatians 4:7</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm" title="Having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,">Ephesians 1:5</a></span>; for in those duties you Christianly perform to masters of the same mould with yourselves, he really looks upon you as his own servants, <span class="ital">{see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm" title="Not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;">Ephesians 6:6</a></span>}</span> yea, and free-men, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-22.htm" title="For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.">1 Corinthians 7:22</a></span>; so that, as Onesimus, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-10.htm" title="I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:">Philemon 1:10</a></span>, ye may more cheerfully submit to your masters’ yoke, according to the command and for the sake of Christ, who reckons what you do upon that account as done to himself, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-40.htm" title="And the King shall answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these my brothers, you have done it to me.">Matthew 25:40</a></span>, and will instate you in that eternal inheritance, to which neither you nor any mortal man had naturally any right at all. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/colossians/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance,.... This is said for the encouragement of Christian servants, who, though they may receive little or nothing from their earthly and carnal masters; yet they shall be used and treated as children by the Lord, and by whom they will be possessed of an eternal inheritance, after their work and labour is over: by "the reward of the inheritance" is meant the heavenly glory, called a reward, because the apostle is speaking to servants and therefore uses language agreeable to them; and who, though they may have no reward in this world, yet as there is a God that judgeth in the earth, there is verily one for them in the world to come: and though it is not given for working, yet it is given to those that do good, and continue in well doing; whose works follow, though they do not go before them; and is enjoyed after their work is over, as the servant receives his wages at evening and when he has done his work; though this will not be received as a reward of debt, but of grace; it cannot be of merit, as is clear from the nature of good works themselves, which are all due, to God, prior to the performance of them; and when done in the best manner, are no more than a man's duty, and are done not in his own strength, but by the grace of God; and in many things, yea in everything, he comes short of performing what is incumbent on him; and besides, there is no manner of proportion between: the best services of the saints, and eternal glory: to which may be added, that eternal life is the free gift of their heavenly Father to them, and is here called an inheritance, which never becomes the property of servants in a way of merit, but is the portion of children, from their Father's good pleasure. Wherefore the heavenly glory is such a reward as that it is an "inheritance"; or, as the Syriac version renders it, "in an inheritance"; it lies in an inheritance, an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled, that fades not away, reserved in the heavens; and which is not got by industry, or obtained by the works of the law, nor bought with a price, but is a free bequest of God as a Father to his children; for an inheritance is peculiar to children, and this to the children of God, as these believing servants were; and which comes to them by and through the death of the testator; and it may be called an inheritance, because the heavenly glory is substantial, it is substance, a better and a more enduring substance than any inheritance in this world; and is a very plentiful possession and estate, it consists of all things, yea, God himself is the portion of his people, and they that are his children are heirs of God; there is not only a glory, but riches of glory, a plenty, a fulness of it in this inheritance; the way in which they come by it, is receiving it from Christ; "of the Lord ye shall receive it". It is in a way of receiving, and so by gift, as a man can receive nothing but what is given him; and as all grace is in a way of receiving, and therefore boasting in it is excluded, so glory is enjoyed in the same way, and from the same hands, even from Christ, the righteous Judge, that will give it; it is in him they obtain this inheritance, and are in him chosen and predestinated unto it; it is by his resurrection from the dead, and in consequence of it, that they through the power of his Spirit and grace are begotten unto it; it is his grace that makes them meet for it; and he has it in his hands for them; he is a feoffee in trust on their behalf, and is able to give it to them; and will at the last day introduce them into the full possession of it. Now these Christian servants "knowing" all this, having a lively hope of this inheritance, a full persuasion, and a firm faith of right unto it, and meetness for it, and having the Spirit of God as an earnest and pledge of it; the consideration of it must greatly tend to make them quiet and easy in their present servitude, and to encourage them, to the discharge of their duty with diligence, faithfulness, and cheerfulness: since they might assure themselves of the inheritance hereafter, how small soever their reward was now: <p>for ye serve the Lord Christ; who is a good master, and faithful to all his engagements and promises, all whose servants are respected by him, and honoured by his Father, and shall be for ever where he is. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/colossians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</span><p>(p) Because you will have duly obeyed your masters, the time will come, that you will be changed from servants to sons, and you will know this for certain, which will be when you are made partakers of the heavenly inheritance.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/colossians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-24.htm" title=" Knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ.">Colossians 3:24</a>. However their earthly master may reward their service, there is a Master who will give them a just recompense; although they cannot receive an earthly, He will give them a heavenly inheritance.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Κυρίου</span>: in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-8.htm" title="Knowing that whatever good thing any man does, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.">Ephesians 6:8</a> <span class="greekheb">παρὰ Κ</span>. The absence of the article is noteworthy. It emphasises the position rather than identifies the Person of Him who gives the reward (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the anarthrous <span class="greekheb">ἐν υἱῷ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1</a>). Haupt thinks that there is no significance to be attached to its omission; but, as Lightfoot says, “it is studiously inserted in the context”.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνταπόδοσιν τῆς κληρονομίας</span>: the “just recompense consisting in the inheritance”. <span class="greekheb">κλ</span>. is a genitive of apposition.—<span class="greekheb">δουλεύετε</span>. This may be taken as an indicative (Lightf., Findl., Moule, Haupt) or as an imperative (Mey., Ell., Alf., Abb.). The indicative is defended on the ground that it is needed to explain who is meant by <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Κυρίου</span> (but this was surely obvious), and that the imperative seems to require <span class="greekheb">ὡς τῷ Κ</span>. But Lightfoot himself quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-11.htm" title="Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;">Romans 12:11</a>, where <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> is absent.

For the Christian’s prospect of “<span class="ital">reward</span>” cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm" title="Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.">Matthew 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-1.htm" title="Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-4.htm" title="That your alms may be in secret: and your Father which sees in secret himself shall reward you openly.">Matthew 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm" title="For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-35.htm" title="But love you your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind to the unthankful and to the evil.">Luke 6:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-14.htm" title="And you shall be blessed; for they cannot recompense you: for you shall be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.">Luke 14:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/2-6.htm" title="Who will render to every man according to his deeds:...">Romans 2:6-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-10.htm" title="For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad.">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-35.htm" title="Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward.">Hebrews 10:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-12.htm" title="And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.">Revelation 22:12</a>; &c. The obedience of love is infallibly remembered by Him to whom it is rendered. “Well done, good and faithful servant” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-23.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:23</a>), is His certain ultimate response to every true act of the will given up to Him. This, as presented in Scripture, is entirely harmonious with the sure doctrine of our justification for Christ’s Merit only, embraced by faith only (Art. xi). It is the recognition of love by love, of grace by the Giver.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">receive</span>] The Greek may be rendered, <span class="bld">receive as your due</span>. The reward, from one point of view mere grace and gift, is from another, <span class="ital">because God has promised it</span>, a debt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the reward</span>] The Greek implies an <span class="ital">exact requital</span>. See Lightfoot’s note. Even “the cup of cold water” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-42.htm" title="And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.">Matthew 10:42</a>) has its remembrance and loving recompense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the inheritance</span>] That is, the reward <span class="ital">consists</span> in the inheritance; is involved in the bright prospect of it.—For a somewhat similar phrase cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-12.htm" title=" Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:">Colossians 1:12</a> (and notes). But the reference here is, surely, to the eternal future. So <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm" title="To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fades not away, reserved in heaven for you,">1 Peter 1:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a>. That future is but the issue of the present, in which “Christ is in us, the hope of glory” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>). But the issue is so “far better” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Php 1:21</a>) than its prelude and embryo that it is relatively a new thing in prospect.—Lightfoot remarks that, by a beautiful paradox, the <span class="ital">slave</span> is here also an <span class="ital">heir</span>, which by human law he could not be. He is God’s heir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-7.htm" title="Why you are no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.">Galatians 4:7</a>) by Divine law. Elsewhere, in other connexions, “slave” and “heir” are contrasted: e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-1.htm" title="Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differs nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;">Galatians 4:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for</span>] Probably the word is to be omitted. It is a good <span class="ital">note</span> to the sentence, so to speak, pointing the meaning: “ye shall receive your reward from the Master; <span class="ital">for</span> Christ is the Master, and He never fails in requital.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye serve the Lord Christ</span>] We may render, <span class="bld">Christ is the Master whose bondmen ye are</span>.

The opposite truth is asserted in ver. 25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a> combines them both.

No form of praise could be more cheering and ennobling to the despised slave than this. "In Christ," Onesimus is "no longer as a slave, but a brother beloved" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>), and if a brother, then a joint heir with his master Philemon in the heavenly inheritance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye serve the Lord Christ</span> (vers. 22, 25; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm">Colossians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm">Ephesians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>); that is, <span class="accented">Christ is the Lord whose bondmen ye are.</span> "For" is probably a correct gloss, though a corrupt reading. Its insertion indicates that the sentence was read indicatively (Lightfoot, and R.V.); not imperatively ("serve the Lord Christ"), as Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, with the Vulgate, construe it.
