How much hidden worth is there, which in this world is not known! But sooner or later it shall be known, as Christ was. He took upon himself the likeness of sinful flesh; and thus, for our sakes, he sanctified himself, that we also might be sanctified, and be baptized with him, Joh 17:19. See how honourably God owned him, when he submitted to John's baptism. He saw the Spirit descending upon him like a dove. We may see heaven opened to us, when we perceive the Spirit descending and working upon us. God's good work in us, is sure evidence of his good will towards us, and preparations for us. As to Christ's temptation, Mark notices his being in the wilderness and that he was with the wild beasts. It was an instance of his Father's care of him, which encouraged him the more that his Father would provide for him. Special protections are earnests of seasonable supplies. The serpent tempted the first Adam in the garden, the Second Adam in the wilderness; with different success indeed; and ever since he still tempts the children of both, in all places and conditions. Company and conversation have their temptations; and being alone, even in a wilderness, has its own also. No place or state exempts, no business, not lawful labouring, eating, or drinking, not even fasting and praying; often in these duties there are the most assaults, but in them is the sweetest victory. The ministration of the good angels is matter of great comfort in reference to the malignant designs of the evil angels; but much more does it comfort us, to have the indwelling of God the Holy Spirit in our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/mark/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-13.htm">Matthew 3:13-17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/mark/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mr 1:9-11.

What the Jews call "Bath Kol", saying, <p>thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: it is in Matthew, "this is my beloved Son", <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>; as if the words were spoken to others, to John, the administrator of baptism to him, and to those that were spectators; directing them to Christ, on whom the Spirit now descended, and testifying to them how great a person he was, how nearly related to God; how much he was the object of his love, and what a pleasure and delight he took in him; but here they are delivered as an immediate address to Christ himself, "thou art my beloved Son". Christ, as he was the only begotten Son of God from eternity, so his filiation was owned and declared to him as early, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>. This therefore was not the first time, nor was it only for his sake that this was said unto him, but also for the sake of those that stood by: but it may be observed, that he is not only called his Son, but his "beloved Son"; which might be necessary to be said to him in his state of humiliation, whilst he was yielding obedience to the will of God, and fulfilling all righteousness; and when he was about to be, as he quickly after this was, tempted by Satan in the wilderness, by whom his sonship was called in question. Now these words being directed to Christ, show that the former are spoken of him, and are applicable to him, as well as to John; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/mark/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And there came a voice from heaven, <i>saying</i>, Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> well pleased.</span><p>(h) See Geneva Mt 3:17</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/mark/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">a voice from heaven</span>] The first of the three heavenly Voices to be heard during our Lord’s Ministry, viz., at (i) His Baptism; (ii) His Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-7.htm" title="And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.">Mark 9:7</a>); (iii) in the courts of the Temple during Holy Week (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-28.htm" title="Father, glorify your name.

This Voice attested in the presence of His Forerunner the Divine Nature of our Lord, and inaugurated His public Ministry. The Baptism was a very important event in our Lord’s life:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) Needing no purification Himself, He submitted to it as the Head of His Body, the Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm" title="And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,">Ephesians 1:22</a>) for all His members;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) He was thus by baptism, and the unction of the Holy Ghost which followed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:">Matthew 3:16</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-4.htm" title="And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water....">Exodus 29:4-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/8-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Leviticus 8:1-30</a>), solemnly consecrated to His office as Redeemer;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) He “sanctified water to the mystical washing away of sin.” See the Baptismal Office;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(4) He gave to His Church for all time a striking revelation of the Divine Nature, the Son submitting in all lowliness to every requirement of the Law, the Father approving by a voice from heaven, the Spirit descending and abiding upon the Son. “<span class="ital">I ad Jordanem, et videbis Trinitatem</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">12, 13</span>.
